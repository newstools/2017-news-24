Earlier, police confirmed that the deputy principal of Edalinceba Primary School in Duduza, Nigel, was shot dead in his office on Tuesday morning. Captain Kay Makhubela told News24 that three armed suspects entered the school premises and pretended to have been asked by the deputy principal to fix an electrical problem. "Three of the suspects went inside, while one was parked outside in a car. When the secretary relayed the message to the deputy principal, he came out and was shot at several times by the suspects who then ran," said Makhubela. Nick Dollman from Netcare911 said the victim had sustained multiple gunshot wounds. "Reports from the scene allege that several shots were fired in the administration block. Paramedics attended to a 55-year-old man who'd been shot more than once," said Dollman in a statement. Lesufi went to the school following the incident and said in a statement that it was unfortunate that the criminal act took place in a school. "Our schools are turning out to be a hunting environment for criminals. This is unbearable, but we wish for calm," he said. The department has offered counselling to those affected. "The police will have to prioritise this case so that we have closure. It is important for the police to maintain high visibility at our schools," said education spokesperson Steve Mabona in a statement. The suspects were driving a red Mazda 323. Police have opened a case of murder and, although a motive is not clear at this stage, an investigation is underway.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
