However reports have said the leaders who were instrumental in Zuma's ascension to the presidency are divided over who should take over the reigns. In the video, Mabuza calls for an end to factions."Today, factions are the norm. You are no longer free to talk to anyone. The movement has cracked, lets get out of this thing (factionalism). Let's liberate ourselves," he said.He appealed to the League members to bring an end to factionalism and rather focus on the party&rsquo;s values.ANC Youth League deputy president Desmond Moela, confirmed to News24 that Mabuza was addressing the league in the provinces. He said he was emphatic that factions don't help the party."He said factions don&rsquo;t help the organisation. They went to Polokwane and Mangaung and the organisation suffered because of the mistake of supporting factions," Moela said.If we cant unite the organisation, the challenge will be with us in the future, he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
