WATCH Mogadishu - Somalia's police say a car bomb explosion in the capital has killed at least five people. Capt Mohamed Hussein said the blast late  on Thursday was at a car parked outside a restaurant in Mogadishu's Hamarweyne district and killed mostly civilians. The explosion shattered a period of calm in this seaside city which has a large security presence following a series of attacks by the Islamic extremist rebels of al-Shabab, who are linked to al-Qaeda and fighting the Somali government and African Union forces in the country. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast. However al-Shabab often carries out such attacks. Despite being ousted from large parts of the south and central Somalia, the insurgents continue deadly attacks across the country. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
