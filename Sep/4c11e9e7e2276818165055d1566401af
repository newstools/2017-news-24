I READ the article regarding the Nedbank ATM incident at Hayfields (“Robbers target women at ATM”, August 23 issue). I had the same experience on June 16, at the same place. There were three well dressed men and when I tried to put my card in I battled, but the one, who had just finished using the ATM, and had stepped back, came to see what the problem was and without saying anything he said I was not putting card in correctly. He just pressed a whole lot of keys and told me to put my cell number in, which I ignored. Who does that? But then when I tried to retrieve the card it was not there so I thought it had been swallowed by the machine. I phoned the bank to stop it. The next day I went to Nedbank to retrieve it, but there was no card there so they had obviously taken it. I spoke to Nedbank and they said it “often happens” we must just be careful. This is very difficult when you are trying to withdraw money and someone just starts pushing keys. YVONNE PMB 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
