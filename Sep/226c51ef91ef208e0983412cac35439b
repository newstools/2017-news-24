JUST over a year ago, on 4 July, Sarel Theron, a Mondi employee was brutally murdered in his Seven Oaks home by three teens.    Two of the three were arrested shortly afterwards in a joint police and security firms operation and some of the victim’s property was recovered from them.    The two appeared in the Pietermartizburg High Court in June on charges of murder and aggravated robbery to which they pleaded guilty. On Thursday 14 September, Judge Pete Koen sentenced one of the killers, Nthuthuko Mshibe, to an effective 22 years, stating that Mshibe had taken part in the murder before he turned 18 and this was a factor that saved him from a minimum life sentence.    Judge Koen said the accused fell 22 days short of the minimum prescribed sentence. The second accused, Siphesihle Cele, is still to be sentenced and the third has not yet been found.    In their appearance in June, the accused claimed they had gone to the house with the intention of robbery and said the third missing member of the gang had stabbed Theron, who had fallen to the ground, and had then strangled him. Theron, who lived alone on the Mondi farm, Mistley Estates, was found beaten, stabbed and strangled in his home by a Mondi colleague who had become concerned when Theron did not report for work on Monday 4 July. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
