"The nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran under [the 2015 accord] are being implemented," International Atomic Energy Agency head Yukiya Amano told reporters. "The verification regime in Iran is the most robust regime which is currently existing. We have increased the inspection days in Iran, we have increased inspector numbers... and the number of images has increased," he said in Vienna. "From a verification point of view, it is a clear and significant gain." US President Donald Trump has called the agreement between Iran and six major powers reducing its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief "the worst deal ever negotiated". Trump has to certify in mid-October whether he believes Iran is abiding by the nuclear deal and that sticking to it is vital to US national security interests. If, as seems increasingly likely, Trump decides not to give the green light, Congress will then have 60 days to debate whether to re-impose sanctions on Iran. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
