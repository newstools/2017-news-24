WATCH Durban – The Hawks have cracked down on a specialised marijuana production lab, nabbing one suspect, and seizing illegal substances worth more than R250 000. Hawks spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo on Friday said officers conducted an operation at Byrne Village in Richmond on Wednesday. "Members pounced on one of the farms after information was received about the hydroponic laboratory operating in the area." He said that after searching the farm, dagga plants, LSD liquid and hashish - with the street value of R260 000 - were found and confiscated. He said equipment used in the operation was also seized. The farm's owner, Russell Galbirght, 46, was arrested and charged with dealing in dagga, Mhlongo said. He appeared in the Ixopo Magistrate's Court on Thursday and was granted R1 000 bail, and the case was postponed to October 19. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
