As revolutionaries, we give our lives to the struggle, and if needs be, we shall pay with our lives, but not under the conditions chosen by hostile forces."Malema said he wanted to attend the funeral to pay his respects and find peace after the trauma he had suffered following the news of Magaqa's death.Also read: Former ANCYL SG dies after being shot in 'ambush'&nbsp;Malema said he was on his way back from a meeting when he received news of Magaqa's passing."The phone call carrying this sad news was brief and to the point, yet it froze my entire body in shock to the point of inevitable and unending tears," Malema said."I could not withhold my tears, which uncontrollably kept showering my face.
