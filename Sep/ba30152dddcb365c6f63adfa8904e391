Siphelele Nketo  A CASE of concealment of birth was opened by Kokstad SAPS after a foetus was dumped next to a scrapyard in Shayamoya on Tuesday. The foetus was discovered by a motorist who was driving out of the scrapyard, and the police were alerted. People believe it was three months old. When Fever arrived at the scene community members had covered it with newspaper while waiting for police to arrive.    Ward committee member Yvonne­ Siphika said she suspects the foetus was dumped by a teenage girl who “was not ready to have a baby”. She asked elders to teach young girls about family planning and teenage pregnancies.  “Incidents like this are uncommon in the area, but young girls who fall pregnant must take responsibility.    “This incident is a disgrace to women,” she said. SAPS spokesperson Captain Dumisani Ncongo said investigations are under way.      24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
