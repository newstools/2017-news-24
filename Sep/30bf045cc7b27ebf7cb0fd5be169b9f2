	     Concord - A federal judge has denied an appeal bid from a woman sentenced to 10 years in prison for lying about her role in the 1994 Rwanda genocide to obtain US citizenship. Beatrice Munyenyezi (moon-yehn-YEH'-zee) was convicted and sentenced in 2013 in the same federal courthouse in New Hampshire where she was granted citizenship years earlier. She's serving sentence in a federal prison in Alabama and faces deportation afterward. Munyenyezi was convicted of lying about her role as a commander of one of the notorious roadblocks where Tutsis were singled out for slaughter. She also denied affiliation with any political party, despite her husband's leadership role in the extremist Hutu militia party. Judge Steven McAuliffe on Thursday found no merit in her arguments that her lawyers were ineffective and her case was hurt by pretrial publicity. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
