Officers monitored the scene while around 300 people burnt tyres, said provincial police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana. No-one was arrested. Motorists were advised that the road leading from Hermanus to Kleinmond, and the coastal road from Somerset West, would remain closed until Monday morning. Africa said the situation had been very tense and the roads were also blocked with rubble and scattered glass. The reason for the protest was not immediately clear. Protests rocked the town, situated about 100km from Cape Town, at the end of August. A few hundred people took to the streets over unhappiness related to the awarding of a cleaning tender. Tyres and crates were set alight across town, rubbish was scattered along the streets and a number of stores were targeted. The Kleinmond municipal offices closed its doors along with all shops in the central business district. A number of concerned residents, trying to find confirmation that protests would resume on Monday, took to social media on Sunday night. Some parents were worried about their children travelling in school buses through the area.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
