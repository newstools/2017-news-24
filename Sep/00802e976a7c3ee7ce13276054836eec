According to Ngetu, he was the only roller skater to represent the Eastern Cape Province in the national junior men’s team. He stated there were 18 countries that took part in the artistic world competition. Ngetu said Kenya was the second African country to participate, joining SA in the tournament. Ngetu said, “The competition was very tight and it was not easy. “Our team competed their hearts out. We did not win any medals, but I have no regrets because our team had learned a lot from the other countries. “Our coach, Wendy Gila, prepared the team, but other countries managed to collect silverware. We took part in an artistic competition in which we imitated ducks. It was a wonderful experience for us to compete against the world’s greatest teams.” Ngetu highlighted that he worked very hard during the trials that took place in Hammanskraal in Pretoria. He commended Roller Skate South Africa head coach Wendy Gila for treating the team like her own children. “Wendy motivated us and she is like our mother. She has a special way of boosting the confidence of the team. “Motherwell Rollers president Marianne Terblanche is also worth mentioning. Marianne supported me through thick and thin. She also showed parental support to me. I want to thank Wendy and Marianne for having confidence in me.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
