The results were then collected electronically, backed on paper by so-called 34A tallying forms.Politically motivated tribal violence&nbsp;But the opposition said many 34A forms were delayed and often had not been signed or stamped, or were illegible or lacked serial numbers or watermarks.OT-Morpho pointed to a further hurdle in its ability to collaborate in the October rerun - "the detailed conclusions of the Supreme Court, specially on the technical aspects of the systems, which are still unknown at this time." Odinga has threatened to boycott the re-run, notably unless several IEBC members step aside, insisting the transmission system inflated Kenyatta's score.Under Kenya's constitution, the IEBC has until October 31 to hold the new election.It was the first time a presidential election result has been overturned on Africa, and follows three previous failed bids by 72-year-old Odinga for the presidency - in 1997, 2007 and 2013.After the 2007 vote, Odinga's supporters took to the streets, and a resulting crackdown coupled with a wave of politically motivated tribal violence left over 1 100 dead.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
