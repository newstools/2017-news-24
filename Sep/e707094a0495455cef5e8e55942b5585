	     AFTER another near accident and sustaining damages costing almost R5 000 a Ramsgate pensioner says he is gatvol about the potholes on the area’s main roads.  Andries Appelgryn paid R4 480 for repairs to his car last week after almost getting into an accident on Marine Drive in Ramsgate while dodging potholes.  Appelgryn said it is not the first time this has happened, and even after numerous complaints to the municipality, potholes in the area remain unrepaired.  “The potholes are right in front of the police station and there are accidents in the area almost every day because of people trying to duck them. Even holidaymakers are complaining,” said Appelgryn. He said he would put in a claim for the damages to his car with the municipality because he believed they were liable.  Ray Nkonyeni Municipality spokesperson Simon April said the municipality was not responsible for the maintenance of Marine Drive because it was a provincial road. “Marine Drive is a provincial road and therefore it is the responsibility of KZN Department of Transport.  “The municipality will send the complaint to them to attend to the matter,” said April.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
