	     Port Shepstone - A 71-year-old woman drowned at Umtentweni Beach, Port Shepstone, on Wednesday, police said. Her body was recovered by an off-duty National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) trainee who was fishing at the beach at the time. The woman had been missing since the morning after taking a walk on the beach. "The cause of the drowning is unknown at this stage. Port Shepstone police are investigating an inquest and circumstances around the incident," said police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele. Jeremiah Jackson, NSRI Shelly Beach station commander, said their duty crew was activated at about 07:00 following a request for assistance from a family in Umtentweni. An off-duty NSRI Shelly Beach trainee member, who was at Umtentweni fishing at the time, reported to have spotted something floating in the water about 70m off-shore, said Jackson. "The NSRI trainee swam out and, finding the body of a woman floating in the surf, he recovered the body to the beach where he was met by police search and rescue officers who had just arrived on the scene. The woman was sadly declared deceased by paramedics," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
