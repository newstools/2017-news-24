	     Cape Town - The parents of murdered student Hannah Cornelius have set up a trust in her name to do something positive for the thousands of other parents and children who have gone through what they have had to endure, Netwerk24 reports. Hannah, 21, was kidnapped in Stellenbosch on May 27. She was raped and murdered.  Her body was found on a farm near the Knorhoek road outside Stellenbosch. "It is mourning and a difficult time," Anna Cornelius said on Tuesday. "But we are not prepared to focus on the negative. We have moved beyond that. "The worst possible thing that could happen to a parent happened to us and happens to hundreds of other parents and children," Cornelius said. "Our wonderful daughter is one of thousands who have been murdered and we want to tackle the problem for everyone. We have a much wider vision than just our daughter's death." Cornelius said the most important aspect for her and husband, Willem, the chief magistrate in Simon’s Town, is that they want to do something positive while most people are just looking at the negative. "We want to create a new vision for the youth, even if it takes us two to three generations. We want to help create a future for those who otherwise wouldn't have had one. "The problems in our country can't be allowed to continue," Cornelius said. "Now is the time to act." - The Hannah Cornelius Trust will be launched in Stellenbosch on October 30. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
