Gugu Msiza, 32, is accused of beating Sibongile Vilakazi, 48, to death when Vilakazi walked into Msiza's cell to wake her up and give her medication, police spokesperson Leonard Hlathi said in a statement. After initially not responding, the detainee, who is suspected of having a mental condition, attacked Vilakazi. Msiza allegedly jumped on top of the police officer, grabbed her by the hair and banged her head several times against the wall and bit her in the neck, Hlathi said. "Other colleagues tried to assist her. However, they were too late. The victim had managed to walk to the kitchen, but collapsed shortly after that." When an ambulance arrived, Vilakazi was declared dead. The case was postponed to next week for a bail application and for Msiza to get legal representation. According to Hlathi, Msiza had previously been arrested for several incidents, including assault on a police officer and malicious damage to property. "It was also revealed that some time ago the same suspect attacked police officers while they were trying to arrest her brother at their home on an assault charge. She appeared at the KwaMhlanga Magistrate's Court on August 31 on two counts of malicious damage to property, assault, defeating the ends of justice and resisting arrest. The matter was postponed to Thursday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
