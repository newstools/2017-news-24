	     Cape Town - Wilderness Search and Rescue (WSAR) has cancelled a search for two missing people in India Venster, Table Mountain saying they need more information. An initial aerial search late Saturday afternoon yielded no results. WSAR’s Johann Marais told News24 that there were three rescue operations earlier on Platteklip Gorge in front of Table Mountain, Suther Peak and Lion's Head. “We [had] a rescue chopper on top of the mountain which dropped off rescuers to help someone who was high up on the mountain. The rescuers then walked down on the Platteklip route to get to that person who couldn’t go further up the mountain,” he said. The 57-year-old man was fatigued and hypoglycemic but was stabilised and sent home. At the same time, Marais said rescuers were sent up Lion’s Head at around 16:00 to assist a person who was injured on the mountain. According to a statement from WSAR, a 34-year-old man with a suspected fractured ankle had to be flown to hospital. Earlier, a 70-year-old man had to be rescued halfway up Suther Peak near Hout Bay after complaining of chest pains. He was stabilised and flown to a local hospital. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
