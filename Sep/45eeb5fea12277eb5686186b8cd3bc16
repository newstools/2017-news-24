	     Mahikeng – Marikana police are investigating a case of house robbery following the robbery and assault of an elderly couple on their farm on Wednesday morning near Buffelsfontein, North West.  Police spokesperson Sergeant Kelebogile Moleko told News24 that a woman in her late 80s was assaulted by two suspects on her farm at 08:00. One of the suspects was carrying a firearm. "She was on her way to her kraal when she was approached by two suspects who tied up her arms with ropes and assaulted her," she said. Moleko said that the two left the elderly woman outside and proceeded to the house where they brandished the firearm at the husband – also believed to be in his 80s – and tied him up. "They demanded money and told him to open the safe, where they took three firearms," said Moleko. She said that the two suspects also made off with three cellphones, solar panels and some cash. The elderly couple has been taken to a local hospital for medical attention. Additional charges of assault and theft are also being investigated. The suspects are still at large, police said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
