Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi told News24 that investigators were 90% positive that there was a connection between the suspect and the murder of the former ANC Youth League secretary general. "Firearms retrieved during a heist in Kokstad two weeks ago have been sent for ballistic testing in connection with the Magaqa murder," Mulaudzi said. Four men were killed and seven others injured in a shootout with police on the N2, between Harding and Kokstad. The men were allegedly on their way to commit a cash-in-transit robbery when they were intercepted by police. Magaqa, who died in hospital on September 4 after being shot in July, was laid to rest on Saturday in Umzimkhulu, in southern KwaZulu-Natal.
