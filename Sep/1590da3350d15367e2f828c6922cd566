Some of the learners around my area come from poor backgrounds and they cannot afford to pay for the afternoon classes and I can't let money come in between my project of shaping their future through maths and science empowerment," said Mbowane.READ: It takes the whole village to raise a childMore than 300 pupils have already enrolled for Mbowane's Catch Them Young project at his recently opened Caltex Mathematics and Physical science Academy sponsored by Chevron South Africa."I expect to have more coming in by January next year," he said.'Patriotic gesture'Geenen Nkalanga, 13, a Grade 8 pupil from a local school in Thulamahashe, says he joined the project because maths in secondary school is complex."I want to become a medical doctor and I plan on sticking with Mr Mbowane for the next five years. I have only had just two sessions with him but I feel like the attitude I had towards maths is changing because he makes it easy for me to understand," he said.Marlon Madzivanyeka, 16, said that he realised that science subjects are important after his sister struggled to get a spot at university."I come to Mr Mbowane's maths and science lessons so I don't repeat my sister's mistakes," he said.Jasper Zwane, spokesperson for the Mpumalanga department of education said Mbowane's project resonates with government's endeavour to promote maths and science and improve the pass rate in these subjects."We appreciate such a patriotic gesture.
