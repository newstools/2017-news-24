This was, in essence, the argument made by Advocate Pieter Botha on Thursday during arguments for an application to grant its expert witnesses permission to present their findings before the triple murder accusedâ€™s version of events is tested. He pointed out that the experts would not be testifying on Van Breda's version, but on the evidence presented. State prosecutor Susan Galloway, however, said allowing Van Breda to testify last means she may not be able to test what he says on his experts.
