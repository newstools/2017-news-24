	     Kampala - A fight broke out in Uganda's parliament on Tuesday amid efforts to introduce legislation that could extend the president's decades-long hold on power. Watch the video below According to AP, After opposition lawmakers accused a colleague on the government side of carrying a gun, a brawl broke out in which lawmakers pushed and punched each other before the speaker ordered body searches and order was restored. A motion had been set to be introduced on Tuesday to remove a constitutional provision that prevented anyone over the age of 75 from running for president. The move was seen as an effort by President Yoweri Museveni, who at 73 was ineligible to run for re-election in 2021, to extend his rule.  Museveni himself has over the past months ducked the question of whether he was interested in more time in office, saying recently that the matter was not so important, the report said.  A BBC report said that the parliament adjourned after a raucous day without debating the constitutional change.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
