	     Johannesburg - Orlando Pirates captain Happy Jele has appeared in the Randburg Magistrate's Court on Tuesday after he was arrested for speeding.  The Bucs skipper was caught speeding at 223km/h in a 120km/h zone early on Monday morning. He was driving in his BMW 351i on the M1 near Sandton.  Jele claimed that he was rushing home to attend to a sick child, which the Gauteng department of community safety found to be false.  He was arrested for reckless driving and exceeding the prescribed limit of 120km/h.  The Pirates player later issued an apology saying: "I refer to the news of my arrest this morning which is making rounds in the media. It is true I was apprehended by the enforcement law agency driving at high speeds. I was taken into the police station for statements and procedures from which I was released on bail." He also apologised for bringing the club into disrepute and said he would take full responsibility for his actions. "I have no excuse for my action and I can only wish the club, the supporters and the public at large to accept my apology as I realise the number of people I have disappointed." The matter was postponed to October 19.  Jele is out on bail of R1 000.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
