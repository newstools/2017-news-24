	     Cape Town – Detectives were “combing crime scenes for clues” after seven people were murdered across the Nyanga cluster in Cape Town, Western Cape police said on Wednesday. The murders took place on Tuesday night and were concerning, said Captain FC van Wyk. Police did not immediately reveal how the individuals had been killed. Nyanga community policing forum chair Martin Makasi told News24 they suspected vigilantism was at play. “It is frustrating because the police said they had people on the ground. It was about an hour later and then the murders happened.” Van Wyk said plans were afoot to engage with the community of Philippi-East regarding the violence. “Taking the law into your own hands is not a solution and is an offence punishable by law.” He urged communities to report crime and allow police to do their work. In a separate incident in Philippi, a couple was found dead in their Sweet Homes Farm shack on Sunday. The man and woman were attacked and cut with "various dangerous weapons", according to Nyanga police spokesperson Captain Ntomboxolo Sitshitsi. A person who lived in the area identified the slain couple as Nkosiyoxolo Mdlakazi, 52, and Nokwanele Limani, 40.
