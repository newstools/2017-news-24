	     Cape Town - The children of a woman beaten to death with a spade allegedly by her boyfriend have been placed in the care of relatives, the Western Cape Department of Social Development said on Thursday. Lorina Van Wyk, a mother of two, was killed on a farm near De Doorns on Saturday night. Police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said an argument was believed to have taken place "which ended up with a [physical] fight". "The suspect hit the victim with a spade over her head. She died on the crime scene due to [the] injury sustained," he confirmed. The 25-year-old man was arrested at the scene and appeared in the local magistrates court on a murder charge on Monday. Social workers were providing Van Wyk’s children – a five-year-old son and an 11-month-old daughter -  with trauma counselling and assistance, the department confirmed. Sihle Ngobese, spokesperson for social development MEC Albert Fritz, said Van Wyk’s family was "very traumatised", and social workers have arranged for ongoing trauma debriefing and support. "The circumstances of this case are truly tragic, and we are calling on our partners at the South African Police Services to conduct a thorough investigation, and prepare a strong case for prosecution," he said. "There should be no space for woman abusers and murderers in our society, and a successful prosecution and conviction would send a strong message to our society that the violence against women and children must stop. Justice must be done." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
