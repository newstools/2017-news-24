	     Johannesburg – The City of Tshwane on Thursday voted in favour of selling the mayoral mansion and for the proceeds to be used for basic municipal services, the city said. Executive mayor Solly Msimanga’s spokesperson Samkelo Mgobozi said money from the sale would go towards building houses for the needy, among other things. Mgobozi said the ANC administration spent R12 million to “renovate” the house, however, the latest valuation on the property indicated that the property could be sold for a minimum amount of R5m. Mgobozi said the decision was taken despite the ANC’s attempt to slow down proceedings.“While the motion to sell the property was delayed due to August’s council being inquorate, we are pleased that council’s decision will advance the process to get rid of the mansion which we have long believed is unnecessary. As such the executive mayor will host the first open house in due course,” said Mgobozi.Mgobozi said despite the exorbitant amount spent on the renovations, the valuators uncovered defects including surface cracks on exterior and interior walls.“There was clear evidence that the money meant to enhance the house went to the pockets of the few.” Also read: Council to decide on selling Tshwane mayor's residence According to the city the house was previously used as a mayoral residential house.The city enlisted the services of Spectrum Valuations (Pty) Ltd to determine the current market value of the property.The house boasts five bedrooms with two en suite bathrooms, two additional full bathrooms providing two separate guest toilets, entrance foyer, dining room, lounge, TV room, family room, scullery, pantry and a fully fitted kitchen with built in cupboards throughout.It also has a study on the ground floor and two outside staff rooms. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
