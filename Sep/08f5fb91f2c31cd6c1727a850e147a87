	     The Democratic Republic of Congo government has opened an inquiry, after soldiers fired on Burundian refugees in the eastern South Kivu province, killing dozens. Watch for more. WATCH Dakar -  The UN refugee agency is calling on Democratic Republic of Congo's government to ensure protection for refugees and asylum-seekers after Congolese soldiers shot and killed at least 39 Burundian protesters, including a child. The agency said on Tuesday that many of the dead and the 94 wounded were refugees and asylum-seekers. DRC authorities have said they would launch an investigation into Friday's shooting, which the refugee agency says began with a peaceful protest over the detention of some Burundians who feared deportation. UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi says the "devastating tragedy" should never have happened and he calls on DRC's government to launch a detailed inquiry. The UN agency says the situation in Kamanyola in DRC's east remains tense, with more than 2 400 Burundians seeking protection near the UN peacekeeping mission base. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
