Kimberley – Deputy Minister of Justice and Correctional Service Thabang Makwetla on Friday described the death of three correctional officials in Kimberley, Northern Cape, on Thursday as a huge loss for the department. "These officials were trailblazers of a new crusade of realizing the correction of citizens who are in conflict with the law and the rehabilitation of those who are social misfits in our communities,"  Makwetla said in a statement. Alwin Louw, George Thomas and Itumeleng Luca Papier passed away in a head-on collision on the N2 near Humansdorp in the Eastern Cape on Thursday evening. They were visiting a parolee at the Humansdorp Community Correctional Centre. Makwetla said they will be remembered for giving those in conflict with the law a second chance. "May the peace, strength and comfort of the Almighty continue to embrace us all during this time of grief," Makwetla said.
