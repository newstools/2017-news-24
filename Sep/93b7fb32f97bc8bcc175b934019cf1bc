Claremont police are investigating a 26-year-old youth pastor who was arrested for the possession of child pornography in Rondebosch last week. The pastor’s electronic devices are expected to be taken for analysis during the course of the week. They include his cellphones, laptop, tablet and memory cards. The youth pastor was arrested at his church in Rondebosch. He briefly appeared in Wynberg Magistrate’s Court on Friday and the case was postponed. According to the police report, his arrest followed a complaint by the parents of one of the alleged victims, a 14-year-old boy from Claremont. Rondebosch police spokesperson Warrant Officer Lyndon Sisam says the case is being investigated by the Claremont police. He says the pastor had also attempted to apply as a police reservist some years ago but the reservist programme was on hold and was not taking any new recruits. “And then with the new recruitment drives which started last year his application was not considered because he did not have a green South African ID. He is not a South African citizen which is one of the criteria for a reservist.” Claremont police also revealed that this is a second child pornography case that is being investigated following that of a man who was arrested in Cavendish Square shopping centre on Friday 1 September. Police spokesperson, Sergeant Lindani Dubeni, says the man was caught posing “as a 16-year-old female circulating child pornography”. He has also appeared in Wynberg Magistrate’s Court last week.
