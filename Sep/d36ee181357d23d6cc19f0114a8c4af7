Bloemside, Bloemfontein, both with head wounds. Police discovered the bodies of Nathan Maarsdorp, 46, and his
wife Megan, 32, on Saturday. They had three young children, Netwerk24 reported. Maarsdorp allegedly shot his wife before committing suicide. A gun was found on the floor. Police spokesperson Colonel Thani Mbambo said officers found the bodies after their neighbours had called the police. According to Mbambo, the neighbours had had drinks with the
couple on Friday, but when they called them on Saturday and there was no reply,
they went to investigate. “One of the neighbours peeked in and saw Megan sitting on
the couch with blood coming out of her mouth. Her husband’s bloodied body lay
close by. The neighbours phoned the police, who had to break down the
door to gain access to the house. The parents had been home alone and it is not
clear where the children were at the time. Mbambo said they would check who the firearm belonged to and
if was licensed. A murder investigation is underway. Koekoe Leon, a friend of Megan’s, wrote on Facebook: “May
your soul rest in peace, my sister. Will always love you.” Another friend wrote: “Omw, I’m speechless. May your
beautiful soul rest in peace. My condolences to your family. So, so sad.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
