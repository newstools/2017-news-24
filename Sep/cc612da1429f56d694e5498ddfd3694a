The children, aged four to 12, were found stabbed to death after their mother, Silindile Mbhele (29), left them alone overnight. Lwandle (4), Sphindile (7) and Lwandile (10) were found inside the house with multiple stab wounds and their left ears cut off. The body of the fourth child, Bandile (12) was found outside with stab wounds. Two suspects were taken in for questioning, but were later released. Speaking at the funeral, MEC for Social Development Weziwe Thusi asked the community to work with police to bring the killer to  book. She said the department will organise counselling for the mother and family members. On Thursday, community members blocked the main road demanding answers from Port Edward SAPS after the second suspect was released. Speaking on behalf of the family, Nkosinathi Mbhele said it will take time before they forget about what happened. “We will leave everything to the police and hope the murderers will be arrested soon,” said Nkosinathi. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said no arrest has been made yet, however, police are still investigating. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
