	     It is evident that the municipality has its hands full with all the service delivery complaints and negative criticism being levelled at them, therefore a local businessman, some of his staff members and volunteers tackled a cleaning-up project in KwaNobuhle. David Goldberg, owner of KwaNobuhle Build It, arranged for himself, six staff members from the Build It branch and fifteen volunteers last Thursday to pick up plastic bags and rubbish next to Matanzima Road and the intersection of Hintsa Avenue. “We divided into four groups and demarcated four areas here with droppers and candy tape so that each group had an area to clean,” said David Goldberg, owner of Kwa-Nobuhle Build It. “This area looks really bad. But we worked as a team and it went very well. We motivated the community to assist in cleaning up and to be proud of the community where they live. Also to help the municipality as they have a lot on their hands. “I drive past this area every morning. It looks disgusting. Areas like this are a health hazard. I am a positive person and as a businessman I want to make a difference in this community.”  Goldberg arranged for gloves and plastic rubbish bags and requested the municipality’s assistance with appropriate waste removal after they had completed their task. “In a way I feel sorry for this community because I don’t see regular rubbish trucks picking up black bags like in the city.  “So now what must the people do with their rubbish? They don’t want to pile it up in their homes.  “I see this as the start on a non political basis to help the community and assist in cleaning up our metro. I also believe that business men can learn from this example and make a difference in our wonderful country,” said Goldberg. The project was supported by Build It suppliers who donated caps, t-shirts and gloves. All involved in the cleaning project were afterwards treated with a healthy and rewarding lunch.  “It is not about money. It is about being proud of where you live and of the country. I firmly believe in a unified joint positive action between local businesses, communities and municipalities to make South Africa a better place,” said Goldberg. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
