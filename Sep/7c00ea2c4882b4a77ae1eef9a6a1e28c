	     New Delhi - Indian police say a stampede at a Mumbai local train station has seriously injured at least 20 people amid heavy rains in the morning rush hours. Police said the stampede was triggered by a rumour that a pedestrian overpass collapsed after concrete chunks fell. Chaos prevailed as people surged forward to leave the bridge. Paramedics have taken the injured to a hospital, the police control room said. Deadly stampedes are fairly common during Indian religious festivals, where large crowds gather in small areas with few safety or crowd control measures. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
