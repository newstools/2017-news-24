	     CAIRO (AP) — The United States says it has launched airstrikes in Libya that killed 17 Islamic State militants and destroyed three vehicles. In a statement on Sunday, US Africa Command says that in coordination with Libya's internationally recognised Tripoli-based government, it struck a camp on Friday some 241km southeast of the coastal city of Sirte. It says the camp was used by ISIS to move fighters in and out of the country, stockpile weapons and conduct attacks. Libya sank into chaos following the 2011 uprising that toppled and killed leader Moammar Gaddafi. It is split between rival parliaments, governments and militias in the east and west. ISIS and al-Qaeda have taken advantage of the chaos to seize territory and set up hideouts, but lost their main stronghold of Sirte this year. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
