Tony-Lee Thulsie and Brandon-Lee Thulsie were arrested in South Africa in July 2016. Besides allegedly conspiring to bomb the US embassy in Pretoria and unspecified Jewish facilities they are also accused of planning to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State group. Their arrests were the first in South Africa relating to alleged ISIS membership. The State Department said that because of the threat they pose to US security the pair had been named "Specially Designated Global Terrorists".

"Terrorism designations expose and isolate entities and individuals, and deny them access to the US financial system," it said. Muslims account for 1.5 percent of South Africa's 53 million people. The country has so far been spared the jihadist attacks that have struck several other countries on the continent. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
