	     GrandWest donated a thousand books to Wingfield Primary School in Kensington to celebrate International Literacy Day on Friday last week.  The donation included 550 new books for 11 reading corners in the Grades R to 3 classrooms. A further 398 books were given to Foundation Phase learners for their personal use.  Paul Derbyshire of GrandWest says the company has a mandate to promote education and be involved with schools. He says they want to emphasis the importance of literacy in and outside school. “International Literacy Day on Friday 8 September represents a celebration of the progress made by groups who create opportunities to improve literacy worldwide. With access to reading corners and new books, we hope to inspire them to read more, to broaden their world,” says Mervyn Naidoo, general manager of GrandWest. He says the donation is in partnership with Read to Rise, an NPO that promotes literacy in schools in poor communities, and Frontline, which helped with bookshelves and carpets for the reading corners.  School principal Ridiwaan van der Heyden says the books will enhance the principle of reading in class. He encourages parents to take advantage of the personal books by reading to the learners and encouraging them to read on their own. Grade R learner Unathi Matutu (6) says: “I am happy with the book and the library at my class. I will ask Mommy to read to me every night.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
