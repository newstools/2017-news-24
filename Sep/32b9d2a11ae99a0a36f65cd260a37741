COUNCILLOR André Beetge has responded to concerns regarding how a proposed development at St Winifreds will affect valuations of properties in the area and fears of it being a low-cost housing development.  “Portion 14 of Erf 970 Kingsburgh, previously owned by Impala Park Retirement Village, was sold several years ago.  “The current owner recently lodged an application to rezone the property from intermediate residential to general residential 2 in terms of the requirements of the Spatial Planning and Land use Management Act 16 of 2013,” said Beetge. He said in terms of the current zoning (intermediate residential), the erf size is 1 6174m2, while the minimum erf size is 1 800m2.  The coverage permitted is 8 895.7m2, which equals 55% coverage, there is a three-story height restriction, the floor area ration permitted is 8 087m2 which equals 0.5 density of one unit per 1 800m2 and a permitted density of erf, nine units.  Comparing apples with apples, in terms of the zoning being applied for (general residential two), the erf size is 1 6174m2, while the minimum erf size is 1 800m2.  The coverage permitted is 6 469.6m2 which equals 40% coverage, there is a three-story height restriction, the floor area ration permitted is 12 130.5 m2 which equals 0.75 density, whilst permitted density is not applicable. “While both zonings - current and that being applied for - are subject to three-story restriction, the title deed contains a 2015 court decision wherein the restriction is reduced to a two-story - title deed takes preference over zoning.  Documents further define the escarpment with indication that proposed development will be conducted with minimum, if any, restriction of view for existing residential dwellings in the area. “The owner or developer has appointed a reputable consultant and due process is being followed. Notices were clear on where more information could be obtained and what processes were to be followed if someone had grounds for objection.”  Beetge said the document of record with Town Planning makes mention of infrastructure, planning process and environmental issues that would have to be approved via the relevant departments during the planning process. “Developers are often criticised for not realising the southern potential, but instead concentrate on the northern suburbs.  “Developing and legally populating areas that would otherwise raise safety and security concerns, should be a priority as it lowers the risk of land invasion and the formation of informal settlements in areas that are essentially suitable for human settlement,” he said. He added it is driven by market demand and increases the rates base, as opposed to low-cost housing that falls under the rates and paid services threshold.  “In the same manner that the developer is following council’s processes in applying for rezoning, the same processes affords residents the opportunity to table reasons for opposing the zoning application or certain sections of the developers proposal - all of which will be considered be the Town Planning committee with certain restrictions that could become applicable during the planning and implementation process,” he added.                     - Supplied.
