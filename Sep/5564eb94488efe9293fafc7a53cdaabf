	     Cape Town – The boyfriend of slain university graduate Aviwe Jam Jam appeared in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday for allegedly killing her. Linda Ntulo, 26, and his co-accused Leroy Morris heard that the State was not ready for their bail application. Their matter was postponed until October 3. Ntulo was arrested after appearing for another case in the Khayelitsha Magistrate’s Court almost two weeks ago. Jam Jam's body was found at the Vygieskraal Stadium, Athlone, on July 29, roughly 24km from her home. Jam Jam had graduated with a tourism degree from the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT). Police Minister Fikile Mbalulu had visited her family home on Women's Day. Jam Jam's aunt Nondumiso Zizi told News24 at the time that her niece had apparently left for Pretoria and that her mother was told not to look for her because she was hiding from her boyfriend.

Jam Jam was in an abusive relationship, she added. Zizi said the boyfriend had attacked Jam Jam's stepfather with a panga because he thought the family was hiding her. The stepfather received 12 stitches as a result of the attack. Ntulo returned to the Khayelitsha Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday to face the attempted murder charge for Jam Jam’s stepfather. That case was postponed until the end of the month. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
