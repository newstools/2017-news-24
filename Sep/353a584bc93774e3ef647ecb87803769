	     Pretoria – A man who allegedly raped his 24-year-old lesbian ex-girlfriend on Sunday morning appeared briefly at the Pretoria Magistrate's Court on Tuesday on a count of rape. The case was postponed to September 27 for the 25-year-old foreign national to get a legal representative. He remains in custody. The police's Captain Daniel Mavimbela told News24 that the man was arrested on Sunday night during a sting operation. The suspect allegedly told the woman while raping her that he wanted to impregnate her, and that same-sex dating was an abomination in his country of origin.  Mavimbela told News24 that the woman had gone to a flat in Sunnyside to visit a friend who was with her boyfriend and the suspect.  "The alleged rape occurred once the couple left the flat to go and buy food. The woman reported the alleged incident to the police, and a manhunt was launched on the Sunday afternoon," he said. Brigadier Ramakamakama Kekana said in a statement that the crime was unacceptable. "Same-sex interaction is not an atrocity in Sunnyside, rape is," he said. "In spite of the victim reportedly having made it clear to him that she no longer dated men, he allegedly saw it fit to enforce his own cultural beliefs on a vulnerable woman," said Kekana. The alleged rapist cannot be named as he was not asked to plead. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
