	     Thirteen specially selected Nelson Mandela Bay primary schools received children’s books amounting to R31 200 as part of the National Book Week which was celebrated last week.  The books were collected from August last year by the South African Book Development Council (SABDC) through participating book shops such as Take-a-lot, Bargain Books and Exclusive Books amongst others. Cllr Samantha Beynon, a member of the Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture Committee, said reading goes beyond literacy as it creates critical consciousness and transcends circumstances. “It goes beyond just us. As we donate these books, the commitment by those collecting it to distribute to eager young minds, speaks to their everyday commitment to improve the conditions of the children. “However, we must be mindful that while we instil a culture of reading, we need to make books and reading exciting and appealing as the books compete with other alluring activities for children,” Cllr Beynon said. The South African Book Development Council’s national #BuyABook campaign takes place annually at participating bookshops where books can be bought at lower prices and dropped in available book drops.  Nelson Mandela Bay, participating in National Book Week since 2012, receives some of these books and donates it to deserving schools. Bongiwe Chigumbu, Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Head of Libraries, said the donations made a major difference in the lives of young children and encouraged residents to continue contributing to this worthy cause. The primary schools that received the books are John Masiza, Swartkops, Sivuyiseni, Bethel, Kuyga, Colleen Glen, St. Albans, Rocklands, Amanzi Farm School, Fumisukoma, Kama, Colchester and Kinkelbos Primary School. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
