	     Cape Town - An advert specifying that "only white candidates" should apply for a digital design position in the Western Cape was removed from a local recruitment website on Wednesday afternoon - more than 20 days after it was posted. People Solved, based in Cape Town, posted the advert on September 5 at the behest of one of its clients. No deadline for applications was provided in the advertisement which called for applicants for an intermediate to senior user experience (UX) design post. The package was estimated at R420 000 per annum. "Please note. Only white candidates," the advert read.

People Solved director Simon Hill said the advert was removed as soon as News24 had alerted them to the "mistake". "We are investigating the incident and as you've seen, immediately removed the advert when we noticed it," Hill said. "I can tell you this is the first of its kind that something like this happens." READ: We're running out of whites Hill said a junior employee posted the advert without checking the content. Companies send the information about vacancies to administrative officers who then process it and post it onto the website, Hill said. "I can assure you that we do not accept anything like this." Hill did not want to disclose the name of the relevant company. "We will be talking to the company and possibly reviewing if we still want to work with them [in future]," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
