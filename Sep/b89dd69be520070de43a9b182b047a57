	     Cairo - Russian media say Egypt has finalised a deal to build a nuclear power plant with funding from Moscow after nearly two years of negotiations. The reports Monday came after Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in China, where they were attending a summit. The nuclear plant will be built in Dabaa, about 13km northwest of Cairo on the Mediterranean coast. Egypt's presidency says el-Sissi has invited Putin to Egypt to mark the start of construction. In 2015, Egypt signed an agreement with Russia to build a four-reactor power plant. It will receive a $25 billion Russian loan to cover 85 percent of the plant, with a capacity of 4 800 MW. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
