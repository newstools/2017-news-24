	     Washington - Chad's government says it learned "with astonishment" of the decision by the US government that its country is on a list whose nationals will be prohibited from entering the United States. A government statement on Monday said the government expresses its incomprehension about the "official reasons for this decision; which contrasts with Chad's constant efforts and commitments in the fight against terrorism at regional and global levels." Chad's government called for a better appreciation of the situation and for Trump to reconsider the decision which it says "undermines the image of Chad and the good relations between the two countries." It said it was open to discussions on strengthening collaborations with the US. Chad is the headquarters for a multinational force set up to fight Nigeria-based Boko Haram Islamic extremists.          24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
