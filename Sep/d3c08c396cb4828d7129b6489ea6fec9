	     Cape Town - Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu has attended the opening of a museum of contemporary African art in Cape Town. Tutu, who rarely makes public appearances since suffering recent health problems, on Friday walked with a cane into the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa and cheerfully greeted people. The 85-year-old former archbishop was among dignitaries and others who visited the waterfront museum, which was constructed out of a century-old grain silo and is billed as the world's biggest museum dedicated to contemporary art from Africa and its diaspora.
