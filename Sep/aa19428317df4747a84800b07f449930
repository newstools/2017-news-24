On August 18, Ping called on the Gabonese "to rise up as one to solemnly mark (his) rise to power", remarks which prompted the travel ban.The interior ministry said the "temporary administrative measure" had been aimed at leaders of political parties and others at the heart of the Coalition for the New Republic (CNR), which supports Ping.Former prime minister Casimir Oye Mba and Albert Ondo Ossa, a former presidential candidate, both said they had been prevented from boarding flights out of Gabon during the ban.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
