	     Cape Town - The case of four men accused of murdering Stellenbosch student Hannah Cornelius was postponed in the town's magistrate's court on Thursday. The matter will continue on November 28, due to outstanding forensic reports and the finalisation of the investigation. Eben van Niekerk, Nashwill Julies, Vernon Witbooi and Geraldo Parsons appeared on charges of murder, kidnapping and rape following the brutal attack on Cornelius and Cheslin Marsh four months ago.
