have been found stabbed to death at their home in Port Edward, KwaZulu-Natal
police said on Sunday. “Three children…were found lying inside the house with
multiple stab wounds on their bodies, and their left ears were cut,” said
Captain Nqobile Gwala. “The other body was found lying outside the house with
multiple stab wounds.” Gwala said the bodies of the children were found early on
Saturday morning at their home in the Ncukeni area. “The children were alone at the time of the attack.” Gwala said four counts of murder and child neglect were now
being investigated by the Port Edward SAPS. No arrests have yet been made. The children's mother had gone out for the night, leaving
them unattended. When she returned on Saturday morning, they were already dead. Gwala would not be drawn on whether the crimes could have
been linked to ritual killings. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
