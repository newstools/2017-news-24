	     Johannesburg - A one-year-old child drowned in a pool in Esther Park, Kempton Park on Friday afternoon after the nanny apparently left the kitchen door open by mistake. "[The nanny] was in the house with the infant’s 10-year-old brother,” Sergeant Sharon Tsotsotso said. ER24’s Annine Siddall told News24 that paramedics on the scene said that the boy had most likely been in the water for between 10 and 30 minutes when they arrived. Despite trying to resuscitate him for almost an hour, he was declared dead on the scene. “People who have pools must make sure that they are covered, because this could have been avoided. If your child is over two, you must teach them how to swim,” said Tsotsotso. She said an inquest had been opened. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
