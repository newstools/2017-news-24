	     North West - A six-year-old boy died after being found floating in the water at the Potchefstroom Dam on Saturday morning, paramedics have confirmed. The child was understood to have been spotted by a man on his fishing boat, ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak said. Paramedics arrived at the scene at 10:30 and found the boy on the dam’s embankment. “Sadly, there was nothing that paramedics could do for the boy and he was later declared dead. [His] family members were on scene at the time,” Vermaak said. The exact circumstances surrounding the child’s death were not immediately known and the police were called to investigate, he added.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
