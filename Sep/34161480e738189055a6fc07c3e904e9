At a registration centre inside a Catholic school in Kananga, people formed long lines, eager to acquire a voter's card.Glody Kabongo said he had got up at dawn in preparation for a six-hour wait but he was unfazed, because the coveted document also serves as an important ID card."I am very happy, because I'm a student and this card will save me a lot of hassle," he told AFP.In Kananga's Nganza district, which has been badly hit in the violence, the turnout was far less - many people have fled, said Mamie Kakubi, the local mayor."I am determined to stay here as long as it takes to get my card," said Emery Nondo, a man in his fifties."It means I can vote to choose leaders who will improve security in our province."&nbsp;Worries for 2017 elections&nbsp;Registration so far has been opened only in Kananga and another city in the Kasai, Tshikapa. People are still being trained to carry out the registration procedure, and it will take time to extend the drive to rural areas.The laborious campaign will have an important knock-on effect for the national timetable.Under the law, voter registration in the Kasai has to last 90 days from when the final registration office is open. That badly compromises the aim of having presidential, legislative and provincial elections take place "in December 2017 at the latest," as the New Year's Eve deal, brokered by the influential Catholic church, stipulates.Last week, Pope Francis' representative in DRC sternly warned that the pontiff would not visit Kinshasa until the elections were held."The (Congolese) state has a tradition of being a predatory state," Monsignor Luis Mariano Montemayor said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
