Speaking at a press conference in Pretoria on Friday, Motshekga said, "All 212 storage points across the country have been audited to ensure compliance with the minimum security standards. Storage points that do not comply will not be allowed to store question papers." The question papers have already been set and have been externally moderated, she said. Motshekga said the department had been working to ensure that the exam was up to standard and that there were no irregularities. There are 636 814 registered full-time candidates and 161 475 part time candidates in 2017. In 2016, there were about 37 000 more matriculants who were enrolled on a full-time basis.READ:&nbsp;Fewer learners to write matric in 2017 The department's director for exams Priscilla Okubanjo has previously said that this year's cohort was significantly smaller because a smaller group of pupils had enrolled in Grade 1 in 2006.

Motshekga said the department had also focused on tracking learner performance throughout the year. &ldquo;We are now looking at how learners have performed in the mid-year examinations and providing specific support for struggling learners.&rdquo; Matriculants have only 37 days left before the exam gets underway.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
