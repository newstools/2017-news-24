	     Cape Town - One person died when a helicopter crashed in Strand, outside of Cape Town, on Thursday. The chopper may have crashed into power lines. Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa confirmed to News24 that the helicopter crashed on the grounds of a school in Lwandle just before noon.  The pilot died in the crash. It appears the pilot was the only person in the chopper. According to the City of Cape Town, a road in the area was closed as a result of the incident. The city said the helicopter had crash landed. Police, firefighters and traffic officials were among those at the scene. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said paramedics were also there. "Paramedics assessed the lone occupant and found that one man had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. Unfortunately, nothing more could be done and the man was declared dead by Metro Services," he said. "It is alleged that the helicopter had apparently crashed into the nearby power lines." Photographs of the scene showed pieces of the helicopter strewn across a grassy patch. The area was cordoned off.
