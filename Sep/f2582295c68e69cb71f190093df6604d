The accused was arrested immediately after the incident,” he said. Dlamini had appeared several times in court before the sentencing took place at the end of August 2017. “Street robberies have been a concern in the Pinetown CBD and most people had started to fear to walk or visit the town because of crime. The conviction is sending a good and clear message to the criminals out there who commit these crimes.  “The station also thanked the investigating officer Constable L Mchunu from Pinetown detectives for doing a thorough investigation and was able to link the accused to the crime, which had subsequently resulted in the sentencing and conviction of the accused,” added Maphumulo. - Supplied.
