	     Cape Town - Four security guards have been fired by a Cape Town security company because cables worth R1m were stolen while they were on duty. The men have taken the company, Comwezi Security, to the CCMA (Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration), GroundUp reported. Xolani Ntwana, Mphelisi Mlambo, Siphe Zonke and Lundi Ndongeni were fired on August 29 after a disciplinary hearing, following two incidents of theft of cable belonging to the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) in August.

Hiding under a bridge He said the men's salaries had "been placed on hold pending the final determination of the recovery [of] the loss sustained as a direct result of the negligence". He stated that security officers are "held liable for their negligence while on duty", though they are not charged penalties for cable thefts during their shifts unless they were negligent. The men told GroundUp they were hiding under a bridge during the thefts because of heavy rainfall. They said the company did not provide shelter or rain gear.

They are expected to have cellphones and airtime to report theft. According to the disciplinary documents, they were too far away and called too late. Zonke and Ndongeni said they were on duty together on August 14 when cables were stolen, but they were unaware that the theft had occurred until the company notified them days later. The four men have gone to the CCMA, which will hear the matter in October. Working conditions Thembinkosi Mkalipi, chief director of labour relations for the department of labour, said in an email that the Basic Conditions of Employment Act allowed employers to deduct money to reimburse an employer for loss or damage, "if the damage or loss occurred in the course of employment and was due to the fault of the employee". However, Mkalipi said, the act does not allow employers to withhold salaries. Comwezi claims that the employees were negligent and therefore at fault. The guards also complained about their general working conditions. Without means of protection, they say, they are vulnerable to mugging. Zonke said his phone and bag had been stolen while he was on duty in May. "All workers are entitled to protective gear, if they work in dangerous areas," said Mkalipi. The men said they had no access to water or toilets and the nearest railway station bathrooms were a 30 minute walk away. They said they had been refused leave because the company was too "short staffed". But Nombeke said: "These security officers were treated fairly and in terms of the company and standard industry policies." He said he could not answer other questions until the CCMA hearing concluded. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
