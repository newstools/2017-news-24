Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa's hat also in the ring and a Manga branch endorsed former treasurer Mathews Phosa.On Saturday a statement issued purportedly in the name of 15 members of the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) of the league in the province denied endorsing Dlamini-Zuma."We have been misrepresented by our colleagues in PEC particularly the chair, Cde Khalid Mohammed Sayed and the secretary, Cde Andile Mbali."The 15 claimed the Dlamini-Zuma's endorsement does reflect the majority view of the PEC."There is no way that we would support the continuation of corruption and the looting of our state resources," they said.Western Cape league spokesperson Siyabulela Tom said on Sunday the disgruntled group knows that it is the branches that make the decision, not the PEC."They must go back to their branches and discuss it there," he said.The party has battled divisions since its chairperson Marius Fransman was suspended over a sexual assault allegation by a personal assistant.It is hoping to rebuild after its poor showing in last August's local government elections.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
