	     Nairobi - Electricity was restored on Monday evening in Lamu County after sabotage by suspected Islamic extremists knocked out power to an estimated 100 000 people. Residents say the blackout lasted from 05:00  until 19:00. Dozens of Kenyan going home to vote in Lamu County, on Kenya's Indian Ocean coast, are being given military escorts following two suspected al-Shabaab attacks. Kenyan journalist Bernice Mbugua said on Monday the military had initially prevented vehicles from heading to Lamu because of fears that al-Shabaab militants, who have been operating in dense forest in the area, would attack vehicles.  She said many of the vehicles were passenger buses filled with people going to their home areas to vote. Kenyan police said al-Shabaab, extremist rebels from neighbouring Somalia, are suspected of planting a roadside bomb that injured two people on Monday and destroying the power pylon that caused the blackout in Lamu County.  Al-Shabaab militants have vowed they will disrupt Kenya's elections on Tuesday.      24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
