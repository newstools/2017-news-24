	     Durban – Two robbery suspects were shot dead during a shootout with police on the N2 between the M25 and Queen Nandi Drive in Durban, police said on Friday.  Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said police had received information about a planned robbery when they came across a vehicle fitting the description of the suspects’ vehicle.  "They met up with a vehicle fitting the description of the suspects’ vehicle with five males in it. As soon as the suspects saw the police, they fired shots at them and forced them out of the road," said Zwane.  Police returned fire, fatally shooting two suspects, he said. During the shootout, the suspects rammed their car into the police car.  An oncoming motorist then ploughed into both vehicles.  "The other two suspects were arrested and the fifth suspect managed to flee. He is still sought. A number of firearms were found at the scene," he said.  He said police cannot release further information at this stage since the matter is still under investigation.  Rescue Care paramedics spokesperson Garrith Jamieson said when they arrived at the scene, they found three badly damaged vehicles across the freeway.  "One lady was severely entrapped in the wreckage and the Durban Fire department had to use the Jaws of Life to free her whilst Advanced Life Support Paramedics stabilised her in the vehicle," said Jamieson.  He said two of the suspects and two police members had to be treated at the scene. One of the suspects suffered a gunshot wound while the others suffered injuries from the accident.  The injured were stabilised on the scene before being transported to various Durban hospitals, he said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
