	     Johannesburg – Three armed men posing as traffic officers hijacked a truck on the N12 in Gauteng over the weekend, police said on Monday. A green Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van with blue lights on the dashboard was used to force a white Toyota Hino truck to a stop on Sunday night, Captain Johannes Ramphora said on Monday. The three men in the Hino were on their way to Witbank, Mpumalanga. The three occupants of the Sprinter were dressed like traffic officers. They held the men in the Hino at gunpoint, searched them and forced them into the van. They were dropped off in Ivory Park, Midrand. The thieves took the truck, R500 in cash, and two cellphones. In a separate hijacking on Saturday night, two armed men in a blue Mercedes-Benz pulled up alongside a double-cab Toyota Hilux bakkie on the N12. The 31-year-old driver of the bakkie was on his way from Mpumalanga to Johannesburg. He was forced to stop next to the Springs/Etwatwa offramp. He was forced into the back of the bakkie and driven to Midrand, where he was told to get out. He called his fiancé and went home. The thieves took the bakkie, a laptop and his R2000 Casio watch. The case was transferred to Springs on Sunday evening. No arrests had been made in either of the cases.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
