The Paris-based group said on Thursday its website was blocked on August 14, shortly after it had issued a statement condemning the ongoing detention of an Egyptian photojournalist. Egypt has blocked more than 100 websites since May, including media sites seen as critical of the government. Rights groups have repeatedly accused former army chief and now President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of stifling dissent. In the 2017 press freedom index published by MSF, Egypt ranked 161st out of 180 countries. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
