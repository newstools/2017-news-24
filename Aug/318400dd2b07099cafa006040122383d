Whilst the process may be harrowing, know that you have the support of many South Africans.Paterson explains the debunked Lombroson theory: &nbsp; Cesare Lombroso (1835-1909) was an Italian psychiatrist and military medical doctor who developed theories about the criminals. His theories are no longer valid today. &nbsp; Only credit which can be given to Lombroso is that he was the pioneer in inducement of scientific methods to criminology. &nbsp; Although anthropometric measurements were correct, the causal connection between human physical traits and criminality was deceptive. Sometimes scientists spend their whole career proving their hypotheses. Similar things happen in every area of human social activity. &nbsp; Development and understanding of scientific methods made possible to prove flaws of many studies in criminology and other sciences. #daggatrial Gauteng province have joined the anti-dagga crowd at high court as protesters have donned shirts from social development @News24 pic.twitter.com/gfqCKuOq8m'Because of the cannabis oil, I've got a new child'- dagga debate at a crossroadsFor one South African mother, cannabis was an illegal drug to warn her son about when he became a teenager: today, she uses it to treat his rare medical condition.Now the ban on using the drug is being challenged in the High Court, raising the possibility that it could effectively be decriminalised.#daggatrial court adjourned for tea @News24#daggatrial Patterson says the word dagga is derived from the Khoi in 19th century, but doesn&#39;t know the exact original meaning @News24#daggatrial Patterson says cannabis was present in South Africa when Europeans arrived here.
