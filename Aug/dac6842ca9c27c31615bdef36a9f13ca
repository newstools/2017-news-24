	     Hundreds of EMS staff marched in Philippi on Wednesday following attacks on ambulance staff.WATCH Cape Town – A suspected criminal was killed and a police officer critically injured when an ambulance was ambushed in Gugulethu, Western Cape Emergency Medical Services (EMS) said on Thursday. A call was received at 22:10 on Wednesday for a patient who was coughing and vomiting in NY147 in Gugulethu, Western Cape EMS spokesperson Robert Daniels said in a statement. Because the Western Cape health department had declared the area a “red zone”, due to the high crime rate, the ambulance needed a police escort. When the officers and the ambulance arrived, five men approached the police and demanded their guns. A shoot-out ensued, during which a 30-year-old man was killed and a police officer wounded. The officer was taken to a local hospital. The alleged patient was never found. It was believed the call was part of a planned ambush, Daniels told News24. Western Cape police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said a case of attempted murder and illegal possession of a firearm had been opened. No arrests had been made. Police watchdog Ipid would investigate the man’s death, Rwexana said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
