	     Port Elizabeth - Four men, between the ages of 30 and 55, are believed to have been killed by outraged members of an Eastern Cape community over their alleged involvement in stock theft in the area.  Eastern Cape police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Mzukisi Fatyela said the bodies of the men had been found dumped in a forest near Mphangana, in Libode, and were recovered by members of the police on Monday.  He said the men, who were all from the same area, had sustained numerous wounds to their bodies. Fatyela said the criminal behaviour of members of the community was strongly condemned.  "A stern warning is issued to members of the community not to take the law into their own hands."  "Revenge seekers become criminals themselves, and SAPS will have no option but to arrest them for their unlawful actions. It is very critical that the community members work with the SAPS and report criminals and criminal activities, irrespective of the nature of the incident," Fatyela said.  "Libode SAPS are investigating murder dockets, and members are currently at the locality tracing the suspects," he said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
