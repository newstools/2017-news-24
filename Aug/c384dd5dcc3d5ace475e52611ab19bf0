Our family fondly calls Egan the 'Little Fighter' because of everything he has had to deal with," said his father Kreason Pillay. The little boy was born at the Netcare Parklands Hospital on October 2, 2015.At birth, a nurse alerted the paediatrician to his laboured breathing sound, which sounded like grunting.&nbsp;Paediatrician Dr Japie Roos transferred him to the neonatal intensive care unit where it was discovered that Egan had a heart condition. His weakened immune system resulted in jaundice soon after.&nbsp;On November 2, 2015 Egan was transported to the Netcare Sunninghill Hospital where he was diagnosed with a coarctation (narrowing) of the aorta, which required highly intricate surgery.&nbsp;Deaf in both earsHe underwent his first operation at the hospital on November 3, 2015 and on his discharge, went home for the very first time.&nbsp;Egan however, had ongoing problems with high blood pressure and required another operation, which was performed on February 19, 2016.&nbsp;He responded well to the treatment and regained his energy.&nbsp;"At home, however, we noticed that Egan did not respond when we called him or tried to stimulate him with sounds," Pillay said.&nbsp;An audiologist found that he was deaf in both ears and a cochlear implant was suggested.&nbsp;The family was referred to Hi-Hopes, a non-profit organisation for assistance in terms of managing Egan's condition. Egan was later found to be a good candidate for a cochlear implant.&nbsp;"Our spirits were lifted by this news at what was otherwise a pretty traumatic time," he said.&nbsp;He received one cochlear implant on August 5. An operation to implant the second one will be done as soon as the family can afford it.Egan and his father Kreason Pillay after his cochlear implant.

We therefore had to implant a device compatible with such technology, as it would not be an option to remove the implant every time Egan required a scan."Egan was groggy following the implantation procedure.&nbsp;"His eyes were also swollen - which he found very distressing. I had to hold him throughout the night to keep him calm."Remarkable journeyIn the morning after the operation, the swelling had subsided.&nbsp; Pillay said Egan was ecstatic to see again and soon after they walked through the ward together.&nbsp;"I remember he was particularly captivated by a fish mural that he spotted in the hospital and I knew he was rapidly recovering his strength."Our family is so very grateful to all of the doctors, healthcare professionals, nurses and everyone who has supported us as a family and who made it possible for him to be here with us."Netcare uMhlanga Hospital general manager, Marc van Heerden, said that Egan's journey has been most remarkable.&nbsp;"Our staff members have been inspired by the bravery shown by this young hero and his family, who have gone to great lengths to find him the help he needed," Van Heerden said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
