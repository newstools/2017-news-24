	     Johannesburg - A minibus taxi driver has been arrested for drunk driving after his vehicle crashed into a tree, leaving 13 school children injured in Meadowlands, Soweto, on Monday morning. Johannesburg Metro Police spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said the children, who were all approximately 7 years old, had been taken to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital.
