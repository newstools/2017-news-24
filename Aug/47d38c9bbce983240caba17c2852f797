The Free State police are still offering a reward of R300 000 to anyone with information that will lead to the arrest and prosecution of the killers of two police constables, Obert Mekoa (32) and Mzonani David Manjo (32). The pair was murdered while on duty at the Koffiefontein Community Service Centre on 29 June. Their bodies were reportedly discovered by their colleague at about 04:00. The men were buried last month in their respective home towns, Botshabelo and Koffiefontein. Lt.Gen. Lebeoana Tsumane, the provincial police commissioner, has once again appealed for the publicâ€™s assistance in provi-ding information to catch the killers of the two policemen. The brutal murder of the two officers is being investigated by the joint team led by the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI), the Hawks. The investigation involves two counts of murder and armed robbery. Mekoa died due to a bullet to the head and Manjo due to two bullets, one to the neck and another to the back. Col. Thandi Mbambo, provincial police spokesperson, said findings reveal the unknown killer(s), shot and killed the policemen on duty in the Community Service Centre. She said a service firearm of one of the deceased police members could not be found at the crime scene and strongly believed was taken by the unidentified killers. The police appeals to anyone with information regarding the killing of the two officers to call Capt. Francois Laux on 082-854-7530. The Crime Stop number, 08600 10111, can also be used. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
