August is known as a Women’s Month and many companies and organisations send out messages promoting that “women need to be protected”. As we celebrate Women’s Day today, Maritzburg Fever spoke to Alexander Road Police Station spokesperson Kholeka Mhlongo, who said as a woman it breaks her heart to see women abuse cases reported every day. “Domestic violence, assault, sexual offences and rape cases are reported every day in our stations. Women need to be respected and treated with dignity every day because they are the backbone of the country.” Mhlongo advised abuse victims women to speak out and report abuse perpetrators. “Police are there to investigate. If the perpetrators are not reported, we are then encouraging them to continue abusing us and commit more crimes. “Women are beautiful and don’t need to be abused. We are created to love, nurture and make things happen. “We turn trials to stepping stones. We are priceless and deserve nothing but the best.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
