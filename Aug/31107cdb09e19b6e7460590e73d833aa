It was unclear how thick the rock wall is.&ldquo;The five miners all have their safety packs, which would give them oxygen for at least a few hours.&rdquo;Several options were being considered to rescue the miners, but the safety of the two rescue teams trying to reach the miners had to be taken into account. &ldquo;Obviously we are hoping to get them out as soon as possible. As time goes by it becomes increasingly difficult to save the miners.&rdquo;Van der Walt said it was unclear if any of the five were hurt.&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t even dare ask that question. As for now, we are hoping for the best and trust that they will be saved.&rdquo;Their families had been informed.Van der Walt said 3000 miners were working at the mine at the time.Harmony Gold management and representatives from the department of mineral resources were at the mines&rsquo; incident centre to ensure the safe return of the workers, she said.&ldquo;Saving these miners remains our top priority. We won&rsquo;t settle for anything less.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
