Captain Stephan Thakeng told News24 he could not say at this stage why or how the men were in possession of the medication used to treat HIV. "They could not give proper documents to be in possession of these tablets." Flying squad members received a tip-off and description of the men on Tuesday. The pair were spotted in the Doorn area, and police officers approached them in a marked vehicle. They tried to flee, but a warrant officer jumped out the vehicle and gave chase on foot. His colleague followed in the police vehicle. Thakeng said the men were unable to outrun the warrant officer. They were allegedly found with bottles containing a total of 5 488 tablets. The men, aged 32 and 36, were arrested for theft and possession of suspected stolen tablets. They would appear soon in the Welkom Magistrate’s Court. Welkom cluster commander Major General Lerato Molale said he was proud to have physically fit members who had ensured that suspects were brought to book. Thakeng said this seemed to be an isolated incident in the Free State. "We just hear people saying that they use ARVs for drugs. We haven’t had tangible evidence in that regard." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
