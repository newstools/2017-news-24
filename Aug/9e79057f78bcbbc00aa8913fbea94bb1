	     Benghazi - Two military officials say a suspected Islamic State militant drove his explosives-laden car into a checkpoint east of the coastal Libyan city of Sirte, killing two policemen. The officials said Thursday's blast at Nofaliya, 130km east of Sirte, also wounded two soldiers from the Libyan National Army. The attack came just over a week after ISIS militants beheaded 11 people in an attack on a checkpoint in the central district of al-Jufra, some 300km south of Sirte, which ISIS held until Libyan forces expelled the militants late last year. Bands of ISIS militants are believed to be roaming Libya's vast deserts around Sirte, preying on travelers and attacking isolated outposts belonging to the army or rival militias. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
