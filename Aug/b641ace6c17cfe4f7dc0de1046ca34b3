	     Nairobi - Rescuers recovered six bodies in Kenya's coastal Lamu region after a boat carrying a local politician and his family capsized over the weekend. Shekuwe Kahale, who made a failed run for a seat in Kenya's parliament in last week's general election, set off with three other adults and eight children for Lamu Island on Sunday, but their boat was reported to have sank in turbulent waters. A rescue team retrieved Kahale and the ship's captain alive on Monday, and also recovered the bodies, Lamu county commissioner Joseph Kanyiri told AFP. "We have a multiagency team in the waters working from different points to find out the rest," he said. A member of the rescue team said rough weather in the area made it unlikely that other passengers would be found alive. Lamu's beaches are popular boating and vacation spots for both Kenyan and foreign tourists. In June, ten people died in the area after a passenger boat capsized. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
