five times – but the father-of-one defied the odds and is slowly learning to
walk again. Leon Ford, from Pittsburgh, US, was shot by police in 2012,
after being pulled over for a minor traffic offence. Police mistook Leon for another suspect, Lamont Ford, but
still proceeded to shoot and charge him. He was charged with aggravated assault
and resisting arrest. Upon his arrival at the hospital, doctors told him he would
never be able to walk again "Just imagine
being shot, waking up, and finding out you're paralysed,” Leon told Vice in 2015, “then finding out you're being charged and facing a lot
of years in prison." Leon was later cleared of all the charges laid against him. And now against all odds, Leon has managed to take his first steps. Astounding
footage posted on Twitter, by Leon himself, shows how his adorable son encourages him
to persevere and keep walking.  The young boy can be heard telling his daddy, who can be
seen walking in a frame, to “keep on pushing.” "Quality time
with your children is the most valuable investment. And for me, it is paying
off,” Leon told the Mirror. Leon has since walked to his son's little league football games in attempts to try and encourage
people to not give up. "So if you want to change the world its simple - be positive and show up,” he says.  Sources: Blavity    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
