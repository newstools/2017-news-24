	     Cape Town – Three couples, including two security guards, were arrested on Thursday morning in connection with an undisclosed amount of money that was stolen from a security depot in Blackheath in Cape Town, the Hawks said.  The three men and three women, aged between 25 and 43, are believed to have conspired with security guards to collect cash bags dropped from a cash van on Wednesday evening, Hawks Spokesperson Lloyd Ramovha said in a statement.   The van briefly left the depot, dropped the bags, before hurrying back to the depot, Ramovha said.  A Black VW Polo followed the van and picked up the bags.  Ramovha said the Hawks and a dog unit were deployed to the scene when a discrepancy in the cash register was found which reflected that there were 13 cash bags stored while only eight was accounted for.     Video footage was studied and the two guards were immediately arrested thereafter.  An Alert for the VW Polo was issued and was spotted near Beaufort West, roughly 450km from Cape Town, on Thursday morning where the second couple was arrested.  An undisclosed amount of cash was found in their possession.  Police soon arrested the third couple in a residential area in Beaufort West.  The group is expected to appear in the Blue Downs Magistrate’s Court on Monday. They face charges related to theft and possession of stolen property.  The security company could not be reached for comment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
