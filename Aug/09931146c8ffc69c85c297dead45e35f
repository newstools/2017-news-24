That is a mistaken view.&rdquo;To show how the SACP input had allegedly been dismissed, Mapaila gave the example of a media statement put out by ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa on Wednesday. &nbsp;In the statement, Kodwa said that the ANC had &ldquo;consistently created platforms for robust engagement&rdquo; with its alliance partners before deciding whether to institute disciplinary action against ANC MPs who publicly declared they voted for the motion of no confidence against Zuma on August 8.Zuma survived the motion by 198 votes to 177 with 9 abstentions. The vote was secret.&ldquo;Each party has had ample opportunity to present their viewpoints and seek to influence one another in our thinking,&rdquo; said Kodwa.But on Saturday Mapaila said the SACP&rsquo;s views regarding disciplinary action had not been sought.&ldquo;They alleged that we discussed exhaustively between the alliance and expressed our views,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;This is not true, the statement that the ANC issued during the week about us is incorrect. They must go and rectify this.&ldquo;We are still waiting to engage with the leadership of the ANC in this regard.&rdquo; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
