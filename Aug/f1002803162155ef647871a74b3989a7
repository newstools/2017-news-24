The man, Ditebogo Kamogelo Molema, 31, is a councillor for Ward 13 in Mahikeng Local Municipality. He appeared in the Molopo Magistrate's court in Lichtenburg on charges of intimidation.  He allegedly sent Mahumapelo a series of messages in July threatening to kill him, prompting Mahumapelo to open a case with the police.  Molema was arrested at his home in Mmabatho on Wednesday afternoon by the Directorate for Priority Crimes Investigation (Hawks).  The Hawks' Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso told News24 that she was unable to divulge the contents of the text that was sent as it formed part of the investigation and would help police determine the motive behind the threats.  Mahumapelo has since issued a statement welcoming the arrest and court appearance of the suspect.  “I welcome the arrest of the suspect and have full confidence that the law will take its course. This is not the first attempt on my life, including attempts at defaming me,” he said. Rikhotso said that the bail conditions stipulated that the suspect may not make direct or indirect contact with the premier or any witnesses and that he had to surrender his passport to authorities.  The case was postponed to September 22 for further investigation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
