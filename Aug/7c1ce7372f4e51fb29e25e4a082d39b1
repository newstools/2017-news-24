The site - which is a cement square filled in the middle with succulent plants and with six symbolic prison bars erected on one side – is the exact size of Kathrada’s original jail cell on Robben Island. The site was opened on Sunday. Former Finance Minister Trevor Manuel paid tribute to Kathrada, saying South Africa needed to be reminded of “service above self, at a time where the ANC had lost its way”. He was one of a number of struggle stalwarts, including Mavuso Msimang and fellow Robben Islander Laloo Chiba, who honoured Kathrada. Even Motlatsi Mafetshe, an actor from Isidingo, Kathrada’s favourite TV show – in which he even once made a cameo appearance – addressed the crowd at the ceremony. Sunday also marks the 34th anniversary of the launch of the United Democratic Movement. This Monday would have been Kathrada’s 88th birthday. He died at the end of March earlier in 2017. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
