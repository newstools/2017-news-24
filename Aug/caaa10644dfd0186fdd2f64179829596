Over 4 000 adults and children are waiting for a life-saving organ transplant and the waiting list for a kidney transplant, for example, is five to eight years. Penni Purcell of Umtentweni is grateful for a heart donation that gave her a second chance. She was diagnosed with an enlarged heart and a faulty left value and put on medication. “In 2005 I became very sick. I was very tired and didn’t want to eat so I was sent to hospital to have a pacemaker fitted,” said Purcell. By that time her heart had become too weak and she was put on the transplant list. “I was truly blessed as I received a heart on September 16, 2005,” said Purcell. Also from the South Coast, Steve Dias received a heart transplant on May 13, 2005 and Sannie Liebenberg received a heart on January 22, 2001 - Supplied 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
