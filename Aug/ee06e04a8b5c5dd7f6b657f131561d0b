On behalf of Beloftebos, Freedom of Religion South Africa (Forsa) on Friday said the owners of the venue believe marriage is limited to a life-long commitment between a man and a woman, Netwerk24 reported. "The owners of Beloftebos are Christians who want to honour and be obedient to God in everything they do. This includes the way in which they run their business," Forsa executive director Michael Swain said. "It is their conscious before God which guides their venue policy and which prohibits them to hold any other wedding on their property." Stanford Tourism and Business on Friday morning suspended Beloftebos from the association and removed the venue from its website. On Facebook, the association said it is committed to inclusivity and community building and regret "the decision" by their members to be "discriminative about their clientele". Beloftebos refused to host the wedding of 29-year-old Capetonian Alex Thorne and her girlfriend, Alex Lu on July 28. In an email thread, seen by News24, it shows that the owner said the venue’s "policy" is not to host same-sex marriages. In Christian tradition, marriage is considered to be holy and a sign of God’s promise to Christians. Recent archaeological research disputed the validity of biblical condemnation of homosexuality, saying the Bible was mistranslated and written during a different time. The World Health Organization removed homosexuality as a mental illness in 1990. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
