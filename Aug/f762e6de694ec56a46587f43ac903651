Police said the 32-year-old suspect targeted the victims who were working at his church as ushers. "Allegations are that this pastor raped all these victims inside the church on different dates after he invited them one by one to come to the church for prayer and while busy praying, he will then attack the victim and rape them," said police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe. The suspect will appear before Lenyenye Magistrate Court soon on four charges of rape. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
