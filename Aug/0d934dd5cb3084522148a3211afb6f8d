Law firm Duncan Lewis Solicitors says its client "has been wrongly implicated" in the case of a jogger who shoved a woman into traffic. The firm said on Friday he has "irrefutable proof" he was in the United States at the time of the May 5 incident. Surveillance camera footage shows a jogger in shorts and T-shirt banging into a pedestrian, who tumbles in front of a double-decker bus. The bus stops just before hitting the woman. Police arrested a 41-year-old man on Thursday on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. He was later released pending further inquiries.
