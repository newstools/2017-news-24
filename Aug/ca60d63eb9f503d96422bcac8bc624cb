	      Bloemfontein – A man was sentenced to 15 years in jail this week for killing Luthando Ndile after an argument, Free State police said on Friday. Madiehe Patrick Pule, 25, was handed his jail term by the Virginia Regional Court on Tuesday, said Sergeant Mamello Mokhuoane. He and Ndile, also 25, had been walking back from a tavern in the early hours of the morning on April 2 this year when they started fighting. The argument was apparently over the importance of being initiated. Ndile ended up being stabbed in the neck with a broken beer bottle. The young man had a national diploma in information technology and had been in the process of reporting for duty at his first job in Mpumalanga. Mokhuoane said the family had seen Ndile as their hope for a better future. Thabong cluster commander, Major General Apaphia Modise, thanked officers for their commitment and hard work in the case. "Not only has the death of Ndile robbed the family of a loved one, the community at large has also been robbed of a young man who would've brought about change. "The incident saw the community lose two young men over a senseless argument."  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
