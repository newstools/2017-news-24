This is the call from Future South Africa who said MPs must show respect for the Constitution and honour their duty to the nation. "Regardless of party affiliation, they must vote Jacob Zuma out of office, once and for all, to ensure that South Africa has a future."More than anything, they must vote Zuma out to ensure that South Africa has a future built on social justice, equality, respect for the Constitution and leadership with integrity and respect." Pressure on ANC mounting - OUTANational Speaker of Parliament Baleka Mbete's decision to allow for the no confidence vote to be held by secret ballot doesn't guarantee that President Jacob Zuma will be removed, says&nbsp; OUTA chairperson Wayne Duvenage. "We will now find out if there is sufficient moral courage for the ANC MPs to make what many believe is the right decision - to remove a corrupt president from office.&nbsp;However, whatever the outcome of tomorrow's vote, South Africa is poised for change."If Jacob Zuma is still in office after the motion of no confidence on August 8, the heat placed on the ANC to remove him as their head - or at least the country s president - will become untenable."Secret ballot announcement a 'surprise' - analysts National Speaker of Parliament Baleka Mbete's decision to allow for the no confidence vote to be held by secret ballot on Tuesday, caught analysts by surprise. This was not expected, as reflected in the rand-dollar exchange rate, which strengthened immediately on the announcement to R13.19/USD from R13.35/$ before the announcement, said Citi Velocity economist Gina Schoeman in a company note. We did not expect Mbete to allow for a secret ballot, as she has been assumed to be a supporter of President Jacob Zuma, particularly as she has shown interest in being an ANC presidential candidate at the December 2017 ANC elective conference.
