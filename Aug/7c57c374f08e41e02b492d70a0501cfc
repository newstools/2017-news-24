	     Port Elizabeth - The case of a 44-year-old Port Elizabeth man who allegedly took pictures of his own children on the sly to manufacture child pornography, will possibly be heard next month. At least 40 nude pictures of his children are said to have been found since the police investigation started, Netwerk24 reported. The man appeared briefly in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. The case was postponed until October 30 for further investigation.  He is facing charges of the manufacture, possession and distribution of child pornography.    Members of the Gauteng serial crime investigation unit raided his home in Lorraine, Port Elizabeth, last year after he was linked to the child porn syndicate Cloud 9. The police's investigating team has worked through most of the forensic information and will possibly be ready by the next court date to determine a date for the hearing.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
