The Department of Communications, together with six Free State district municipalities, have embarked on a campaign to roll out the broadcasting digital migration.  This process started on Monday (21/08) and has seen the registration and installation of government subsidised Set-Top Boxes (STBs). This has been undertaken in the municipalities of Lejweleputswa, Ma- tjhabeng, Nala, Tswelopele, Tokologo and Masilonyana. Qualifying residents have been encouraged to register for the STBs.  The department is working with the South African Post Office to reach communities and to distribute the subsidised television decoders.  To qualify for government subsidised decoders, television-viewing households must be earning less than R3 200 per month. Additional information is available at all post offices.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
