	     Cape Town - Minister of Public Enterprises, Lynne Brown, has
asked her personal assistant, Kim Davids, to step down following allegations
related to the email leaks this week. On Wednesday, amaBhungane and Scorpio reported that three people
close to Brown, including Davids, have links to the Gupta family. According to
the story, this suggests that the Guptas engineered several channels to the
minister, and raises concerns about Brown's own capture by Gupta family
interests.  - Read the story here: #GuptaLeaks - How the family encircled Lynne Brown "This past week I have been confronted by allegations
against Ms Davids. In the interest of fairness I asked Ms Davids to respond to
these allegations," Brown said in a statement on Wednesday. "I was satisfied with her responses but I felt that the
continuous allegations against Ms Davids could compromise the legitimacy of my
office. "My decision is not an expression of guilt on the part
of Ms Davids. However, it is important that my office is above reproach.  "I want to thank Ms Davids for her service and wish her
well," said Brown. - See the #GuptaLeaks site  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
