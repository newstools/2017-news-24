	     Harare - A Zimbabwe army officer has appeared in court in Harare after he was found in possession of four elephant tusks worth nearly $3 000, a report says. Thirty-two-year-old Joseph Mupamhanga, from Harare's Pomona Barracks, was arrested on Sunday by police detectives posing as ivory buyers, says the state-run Herald.  Mupamhanga appeared in court on Tuesday facing charges of illegally possessing ivory. He was remanded in custody to August 10. "The tusks were taken to National Parks and Wildlife offices where they weighed 16.8kg with a value of $2 856," the Herald said. Under Zimbabwe's tough wildlife laws, Mupamhanga will face a mandatory nine-year jail term if convicted. Last month a traditional healer from western Tsholotsho district was sentenced to nine years in jail after he was found in possession of less than a kilogramme of ivory. He's said to have used the ivory in his bone-casting rituals.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
