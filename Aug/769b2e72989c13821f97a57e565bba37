Senior Superintendent Romeo M Caramat jnr said 66 police operations in various parts of Bulacan province Tuesday left 32 suspects dead in encounters with police, while 107 others were arrested. Confiscated during the operations were more than 200g of methamphetamine, 786g of marijuana, assorted firearms, grenades and ammunition. Police records show that since the nationwide crackdown started, more than 3 200 alleged drug offenders have been killed in gunbattles with law enforcers. More than 2 000 others died in drug-related homicides, including attacks by motorcycle-riding masked gunmen and other assaults. Human rights groups report a higher toll and demand an independent investigation into Duterte's possible role in the violence. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
