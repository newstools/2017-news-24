Durban CBD on Friday morning "is willing to reveal more details"
about the circumstances leading to the crime, KwaZulu-Natal police said. Police spokesperson
Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane told News24 that the body has not yet been
found. The suspect was found with the
human head stashed in a backpack on the corner of Cross and Short Street in the
CBD. "More arrests are imminent
as the suspect has promised to shed more light on the ordeal. For now, he is
the only one who has been arrested and charged with murder," he said. Zwane said he could not share
more details on the matter as investigations were still ongoing, but said it
was "obvious" that the man was not alone when he committed the crime. Initial reports had revealed
that the man was arrested with a sangoma he had met to sell the head to. "For now the sangoma has not been arrested," Zwane
said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
