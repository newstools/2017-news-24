	     Cape Town - The family of Jacques and Sunita van Dyk, who burnt to death in their farm house outside Wellington in May this year, may have to wait as long as eight years to find out whether the couple took any narcotics on the fatal night, an officer with the police's forensic department said. The couple’s charred bodies were found in mysterious circumstances in the bathroom of their house. Sunita was lying in the bath tub filled with water. Her husband was found on his back on the bathroom floor.  Both died of smoke inhalation. Their dog, Skollie, also died in the fire. The police are busy with an inquest, but friends and family believe there might be more to the couple’s death.

Family and friends of the Van Dyks are hopeful that the toxicology report will provide answers to their questions. However, a forensic officer says it could take years for the report to be finished, Netwerk24 reports. "All toxicology investigations in the country are done in the laboratory in Cape Town. Whether you mark it as urgent or not, it takes very long." A friend of Sunita said her mother, Susan Marais, is still very emotional and depressed after the death of her daughter. "It is very difficult for all of us to close this chapter," she said.  The couple burnt to death in their farm house outside Wellington in May this year.
