Spokesperson for the commission Sipho Ngwema said the laptops were stolen during the day on Tuesday, while staff was on assignment. The computers were stolen from a  division responsible for investigations into cartel conduct. Ngwema said the Hawks were investigating the theft, and the commission had subsequently improved security. The theft is the latest in a string of robberies at state institutions. In March, more than a dozen computers were stolen from the human resources unit of the Office of the Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng in Midrand, Johannesburg. In April the SABC’s Parliamentary offices were broken into and laptops were stolen, although police found no evidence of forced entry. In early July computers were stolen from the Hawks headquarters in Pretoria. At the time Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said no dockets were taken. In late July an intruder broke into the Parliamentary Precinct in Cape Town, and made off with a computer keyboard and monitor after ransacking an office.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
