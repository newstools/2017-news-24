  ILLEGAL abortion is a crime and police have issued a stern warning to those who have committed illegal abortions as they will be charged for concealment of birth. Pinetown police spokesman Captain Bongumusa Manqele advises women to use contraceptives or to abstain from sex to prevent pregnancy instead of using backdoor abortion clinics. Manqele was speaking after an incident where a foetus was found wrapped a plastic bag in Hills Street in Pinetown recently. ER 24 spokesperson Russell Meiring said that the foetus was left next to a dustbin wrapped in a plastic bag. "ER24 paramedics were called to the scene after a community member had apparently spotted the foetus among the refuse next to the dustbin.It was evident to paramedics that the foetus had been dead for some time. Nothing more could be done by paramedics," said Meiring. Manqele said that residents should not turn to backdoor abortion options, they must use a recognised clinic if they want an abortion. "Dumping a baby or foetus in dustbin is a crime. Anyone found doing so will be charged and prosecuted for concealment of birth," he said. The Ward 18 Councillor Melaine Braustesh said the community needs to know that by using illegal abortion clinics there are putting their lives in danger. "Anyone who needs an abortion has to use a government clinic as it is done free of charge.    “Staff at these clinics are trained and are professionals in health care so I advise those who want an abortion to use state facilities rather than backdoor abortions clinics," she said.
