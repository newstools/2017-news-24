This is something we used to hear about in other African countries such as Ghana, South Africa and Zambia, where the baton was passed on without hassle.&rdquo;Information technology vendor Joaquim Bile, who is based in Luanda, welcomed the change of guard.&ldquo;Political stability always comes with a constant change of leadership, as opposed to life presidencies. "While I&rsquo;m happy with Louren&ccedil;o&rsquo;s election, I would like to give credit to Dos Santos for displaying political maturity. We now have hope in the country&rsquo;s prospects,&rdquo; Bile said. &ndash; CAJ News 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
