Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari discussed the sale in his first phone call with President Donald Trump.The State Department notified Congress late on Wednesday of its plans to approve the sale. That starts a 30-day period in which lawmakers could try to block the sale. It's unlikely Congress will block the sale.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
