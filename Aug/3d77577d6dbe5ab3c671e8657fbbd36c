On Thursday, neatly-groomed Ronaldo van Rooyen and Tawfeeq Ibrahim, both dressed in black and white, greeted family members leaning over the public gallery during a short delay to try and locate the witness, Naeem Rhodes. The State gave Rhodes time to get to court, after noting he had signed for receipt of the subpoena calling him to testify. "He didn't pitch up today," prosecutor Maria Marshall said. READ: 2 men accused of murdering Kuils River mother back in court A warrant of arrest was issued against Rhodes, and proceedings were rolled over to Monday, September 4. Hector went missing from her work at the Oostenberg Lodge, Kuils River, on March 14, 2016. She was last seen in her boyfriend's BMW. Her family was beside themselves with worry, circulating pictures of her, and pleading for any information on her whereabouts. Her body was found in the Groot Drakenstein area, near Paarl, nine days later. Van Rooyen and Ibrahim face charges of murder, vehicle robbery, and defeating the ends of justice. The case is being handled by Judge Lister Nuku, one of the youngest judges in the Western Cape. It started in the Blue Downs Magistrate's Court, and has been dogged by delays over DNA results and other issues. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
