Kenyan journalist Fred Ooko says people from the Kondele slum in Kisumu burned tires and blocked roads on Wednesday. Kisumu, a port city on Lake Victoria, is one of Kenya's largest urban centers. Authorities have been concerned about possible violence following elections on Tuesday. Opposition leader Raila Odinga has alleged fraud following the release of results showing him trailing President Uhuru Kenyatta by a wide margin. Odinga alleged that hackers used the identity of a murdered electoral official to gain entry to the election commission's database in order to manipulate voting results. He was referring to Christopher Msando, an election official in charge of managing information technology systems who had sought to reassure voters that the results of Tuesday's elections would not be exposed to tampering. But on July 31 officials announced that Msando had been tortured and killed. Odinga made the allegation about Msando's identity at a news conference on Wednesday at which he said the elections were a fraud. Results released by the election commission have shown Odinga trailing President Uhuru Kenyatta by a wide margin.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
