Acting provincial commissioner Major General Bheki Langa said the firearms, including two AK47s, were recovered by Ilembe Cluster members, the Umhlali K9 unit and the National Intelligence Unit on Wednesday. "On Women’s Day, from 03:00 in the morning, police conducted intelligence driven operations in areas such as Maphumulo, Sundumbili and Ngudwini. They were looking for firearms and wanted suspects," said Langa. A total of seven unlicenced firearms, along with ammunition, were recovered. The firearms include AK47 rifles, .303 rifle, pistols and homemade shotguns, he said. "These firearms were mainly used in faction fights and taxi related incidents, as the area is commonly known [for] faction fights and the killing of taxi owners," Langa said. Five suspects who were found in possession of the unlicensed firearms and ammunition were arrested, he said. "All recovered firearms will be sent for ballistic tests to establish if they were used in any crimes in the area. Arrested suspects are expected to appear today (Thursday) at KwaDukuza and Maphumulo Magistrate’s Court," Langa said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
