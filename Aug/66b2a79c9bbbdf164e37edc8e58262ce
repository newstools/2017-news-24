	     Florida — An 8-year-old Florida girl has died five months after she was injured while drinking boiling water through a straw on a dare. The SunSentinel reports Ki'ari Pope started having trouble breathing on Sunday night. She told her mother's boyfriend, who called 911. She was taken to a hospital where she died. Marquisia Bonner, the child's 22-year-old mother, says Ki'ari had suffered complications since March when she took the dare from her cousin after they watched a YouTube video where someone appeared to drink boiling water from a straw. She had emergency surgery on her windpipe to clear scar tissue. Her mother says a tracheotomy left her with trouble breathing and talking. Boynton Beach police spokesperson Stephanie Slater says the medical examiner will determine the cause of death. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
