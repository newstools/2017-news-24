	     Worcester - Four alleged kidnappers were arrested near Worcester following a botched abduction on Wednesday, Western Cape police said. The men were arrested after being cornered by police after the snatched man, taken from his home in Zolani, Ashton, was found lying near Bonnievale with three gunshot wounds. He has been admitted to hospital. SAPS spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut said the reported abduction took place at about 10:30 on Wednesday. “Police members who are attached to the Provincial Crime Combat Unit… responded [to] information [of] a red VW Polo with four men who drove away from the crime scene,” he said. The car was spotted at Robertson Road, which enters Worcester from the direction of Ashton, and the officers “forced all [the] occupants to surrender". “The four suspects were searched and found with three 9mm pistols and a 38 Special revolver,” Traut said. The suspects, aged between 26 and 34, are expected to appear in the Montagu Magistrate’s Court on Friday, on charges of abduction, attempted murder and possession of unlicenced firearms and ammunition. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
