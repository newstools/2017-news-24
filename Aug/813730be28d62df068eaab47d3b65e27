Harris County jail records show 21-year-old Sidney Woytasczyk of Spring was being held on Tuesday on $20 000 bond. Another resident found the baby last Thursday. Woytasczyk was arrested after investigators followed a trail of blood to her apartment, where she'd given birth hours earlier. Sheriff's Deputy Kimberly Thomas says the mother told authorities she didn't know she was pregnant and feared the baby would come between her and the father, who's not charged. A judge will decide who gets custody of the baby, who has been hospitalised with a bacterial infection. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
