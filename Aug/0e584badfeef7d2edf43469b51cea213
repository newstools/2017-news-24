	     Harare – Zimbabwean war veterans have reportedly
challenged the First Lady Grace Mugabe, who claims to be the "mother of
the nation" to show that she is a "competent mom" by "disciplining her unruly
sons". "She can't be a mother to 14 million
Zimbabweans when she is failing to [control] just two sons," national war
veterans' secretary general Victor Matemadanda was quoted as saying by New Zimbabwe.com.  Grace recently admitted that her two sons –
Robert Junior and Chatunga Bellarmine – had become wild and were giving her "sleepless
nights", as they had taken to beer binges and drugs. This was after the two boys were evicted from a
luxury apartments block in Johannesburg’s affluent Sandton area because of
their "unacceptable behaviour". The war veterans' attack on Grace came after she moved to lecture and scold Mugabe's two vice president and
cabinet ministers during a campaign rally in Chinhoyi over the weekend. Grace warned her husband’s deputies Emmerson
Mnangagwa and Phelekezela Mphoko that they risked losing their jobs if they did
not perform to the expectations of the 93-year-old Mugabe. She also ridiculed Local Government Minister
Saviour Kasukuwere over his "big belly". Grace then went on to humiliate Mugabe's
spokesperson George Charamba for ignoring her philanthropic work in Mazoe while
giving her "party rivals" positive coverage. But Matemadanda said: "Let her [Grace] bring her
children to the rallies, and also humiliate the two boys. She must tell them 'stop
it' in front of other youths, then we say she is a strict disciplinarian."  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
