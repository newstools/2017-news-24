doctors who performed a minor surgery on Zimbabwean Vice President Emmerson
Mnangagwa reportedly said that they "detected traces of palladium poison
which had partly damaged part of his liver". According to NewsDay,
sources close to Mnangagwa said that the doctors discovered that the deputy
president consumed non-radioactive which could require a systems flush out over
the next two months. "The VP ingested potent, non-radioactive
poison which has low quality palladium substances which caused minor liver
damage and he had to undergo surgery…," one of the sources was quoted as
saying. The vice president, 74, was flown to South Africa last
week for emergency medical care. Mnangagwa, who was seen as a favourite to
succeed President Robert Mugabe, fell ill at a rally where the president was speaking
on August 12, suffering what appeared to be severe food poisoning. Mnangagwa's main rivals Citing
unnamed sources, The Standard newspaper said Mnangagwa underwent surgery on
Wednesday "to treat the alleged poisoning". State
media did not report on his return. With
Mugabe, 93, in increasingly frail health, speculation over his successor has
focused on Mnangagwa, a veteran regime loyalist. Mnangagwa's main rivals within
the ruling Zanu-PF come from the younger "G40" group which is thought
to back Mugabe's wife Grace as a potential successor. The president, who often travels
abroad for medical treatment, has refused to name a successor and repeatedly
denounced factionalism within the party. Zimbabwe is to hold elections
next year, with opposition parties in talks to try to unite in order to field a
single candidate to oppose Mugabe. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
