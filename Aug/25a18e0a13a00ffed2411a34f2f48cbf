According to an AFP tally, 17 people have died in election-related violence since Wednesday.&nbsp;'Lawlessness'&nbsp;Matiangi denied there had been any casualties, and said police had clamped down on "erratic incidents of lawlessness," adding the government would stop at nothing to protect citizens. "The police have not used live bullets on any peaceful protesters," he said.Human Rights Watch on Saturday urged police to show restraint.Odinga, 72, has not yet addressed his supporters after losing his fourth shot at the presidency. He believes elections in 2007, 2013 and now 2017 were snatched away from him.He laid out accusations of a massive hacking attack on election commission servers, and said they had evidence the true results - which showed him to be the winner - were being hidden.The IEBC denied this, and argued his supporting documents were riddled with arithmetic errors and originated from a Microsoft database while the electronic tallying system was based on Oracle.On Saturday, Kenyan election monitoring group ELOG, which deployed 8,300 observers and carried out a parallel tallying operation at a sample of polling stations, released a statement backing up the official results.And former UN chief Kofi Annan, who helped mediate an end to the 2007 crisis, congratulated Kenyatta on his win and urged Odinga, "a courageous defender of democracy" to turn to the courts with his grievances.EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini congratulated Kenyatta in a statement late Saturday but called for calm heads to prevail. "All political forces should now look to the future and work together, at national and local levels, for the good of the country and the Kenyan people as a whole," she said. &nbsp;Exclusion, resentment&nbsp;Politics in Kenya is largely divided along tribal lines, and the winner-takes-all nature of elections has long stoked communal tensions. Odinga's ethnic Luo supporters - and their allies from other groups - believe they have been denied political power by elites from the Kikuyus, the same ethnic group as Kenyatta, the country's biggest community."President Kenyatta, unlike his first term, must include everyone in his government," wrote the Daily Nation in an editorial, warning that limiting power to his tribal allies was "exacerbating exclusion and creating resentment and disillusionment."In his acceptance speech Kenyatta urged Odinga and his supporters, to "work together... so that we can build this nation together"."Let us be peaceful... We have seen the results of political violence. And I am certain that there is no single Kenyan who would wish for us to go back to this."bur-fb/pg/rbORACLE24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
