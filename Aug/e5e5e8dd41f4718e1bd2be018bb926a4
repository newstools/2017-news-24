Siphelele Nketo  RESIDENTS of five villages in Umzimkhulu blocked rural gravel roads on Monday, demanding electricity.   This also resulted in several schools being disrupted. People said the Umzimkhulu Mayor, Mphuthumi Mpabanga, promised that electricity will be installed in their villages at the end of July, but this didn’t happen.    When Mpabanga was contacted by Fever to confirm what the community were saying, he denied this and said a tender was advertised in July and it is going to be awarded to the right person soon. He said a service provider will be introduced in October. “I want people to be patient with the municipality,” said Mpabanga. The villages of Delamzi, Khayeka, Mthintwa, Goso, Buqwini, Lucingweni and Mangeni have no electricity and people blame government for dragging its feet in addressing service delivery needs. Nombali Tsheleza, a Delamzi village resident said taps are dry in the village.    “The village has no water, proper houses and roads are not maintained. We want government to listen to our concerns.” Last week the provincial government handed over the new Mfulamhle Bridge and a tarred road to the Umzimkhulu community.    Mpabanga admitted there are many rural villages without electricity, and said the delay was caused by electricity capacity.    He said substations are now being upgraded to enable more villages to be electrified.       24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
