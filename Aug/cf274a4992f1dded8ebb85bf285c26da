	     Algiers - Algeria's official news agency says the North African country's stroke-afflicted president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, has fired Abdelmadjid Tebboune as prime minister. The APS news agency, citing a presidential statement, said on Tuesday that former Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia is back in the job he's previously held three times, as Tebboune's replacement. Tebboune had been prime minister since the ruling coalition's victory in parliamentary elections in May. Bouteflika suffered a stroke in 2013 and lives in medicalized housing. Opposition parties have expressed doubts about whether the 80-year-old still fully controls the reins of presidential power in the oil-rich, gas-exporting country. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
