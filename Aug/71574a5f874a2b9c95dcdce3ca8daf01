He was spotted in a driving school vehicle on the shoulder of the road between Bhunga Avenue and Jan Smuts Drive at 07:15, mayoral committee member for safety, security and social services JP Smith said. "The driver refused to stop and the officer eventually forced him to a standstill. During a sobriety test, the driver was initially unable to blow into the breathalyser and, when he eventually did, the reading was 1.34 mg per 100ml of blood – more than 12 times the legal limit." WATCH: 'Only 11% of drunk-driving charges result in sentencing' The man was on his way to Gallows Hill drivers’ licence testing centre, where one of his clients was due to take his test. Instead, he was taken to the Athlone police station. "With a reading like that, it appears the instructor should have been the one passing out. Sadly, it is no laughing matter and is an example of the kind of contempt people have for law and order," Smith said. "Much of this rests on the fact that the city struggles to get convictions on drunk-driving cases, particularly because of weaknesses within the criminal justice system. These are weaknesses we are addressing with the National Prosecuting Authority and the Department of Justice," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
