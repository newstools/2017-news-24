	     Durban – A 14-year-old boy has been killed after a bus full of school-going children crashed in KwaZulu-Natal on Tuesday morning.  The crash took place between Mandeni and Eshowe, IPSS spokesperson Paul Herbst said.  “The bus was fully packed with school kids. Six others have been critically injured. One of those six was airlifted to hospital. The other five remain critical.” Herbst said the pupil had to be airlifted due to poor terrain.  “The road conditions are not good.” The cause of the accident is yet to be established.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
