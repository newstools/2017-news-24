The memorial was officially unveiled by state president Jacob Zuma together with KZN Premier Willis Mchunu and Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa.    This was in recognition of Luthuli’s contribution to the struggle for liberation and the fight against the apartheid regime during his time. Minister Mthethwa acknowledged Luthuli as one of the key contributors in the fight against apartheid. “As we return to this sacred place where his mortal remains are buried, we once again make a pledge that we won’t let Albert Luthuli’s legacy die,” said Mthethwa. This event significantly coincided with the year O.R Tambo, another leaders and former president of the ruling party who worked hand in hand with Luthuli in the 1950s, would have turned 100.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
