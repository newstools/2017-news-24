Constable Nobukhosi Msimanga, 39, who worked at the Alexandra Road police station, and her husband Thabo Msimanga, 47, were attacked and shot by unknown gunmen around 21:00. Their daughter found their bodies lying outside the home, said police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker. "It is alleged that the suspects shot and killed both the victims before fleeing the scene. The bodies of the victims were discovered by their daughter, who heard the gunshots and went out to investigate," said Naicker. The motive for the killing was still unknown and the suspects were still being sought by the police, said Naicker. "Plessislaer police are investigating both the murders," he said. KwaZulu-Natal acting provincial commissioner Major General Bheki Langa condemned the killing of the police officer and her husband. "I express my heartfelt condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of the member and her husband, who were the victims of this horrendous crime," he said. Langa said they would be monitoring this investigation very closely to ensure that those involved in this horrific killing will be brought to book and face the consequences for their wrongful acts. "We will not accept the execution of our police officers, whether they are on or off duty, and these thugs must know that we will be closing [in] on them soon," said Langa.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
