	     Mbombela – A couple who wanted to help a motorist after an accident in Middelburg, Mpumalanga, came face to face with an armed hijacker instead. "The hijacker pulled the trigger, but the shot didn't go off," said Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe, the police's spokesperson in Mpumalanga.  According to Netwerk24, the shooter hot-footed it away from the scene, closely followed by the man who had intended to help him.  The man then stopped a police vehicle which happened to have driven past. "The police continued the search for the culprit and the couple went back to the scene of the accident," said Bhembe. When they got to the car, which had ended up in a ditch, they heard someone knock. And there, locked in the boot, they found the owner of the vehicle. Bhembe said the car had apparently been hijacked at Kanonkop in Middelburg late on Wednesday afternoon. "The hijacker had forced the owner into the boot and tried to make a getaway in the car, but he lost control of it and the vehicle ended up in a ditch." The police found the alleged hijacker, 25, and arrested him. They also seized a pistol. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
