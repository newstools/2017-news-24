Lethiwe Makhanya PEOPLE, especially women, are urged to be careful when drawing money from ATMs. This is after Claudia Banha had her card stolen at the Nedbank ATM at Hayfields Mall on Women’s Day.    Banha said she was in the queue waiting to withdraw money when he saw two guys at the two ATMs. “While waiting to use the ATM one guy asked me if I was going to deposit or withdraw, and I said ‘withdraw’. “At the ATM I realised I couldn’t put my card into the slot, but as I was trying the guy, who asked me earlier what I was going to do, rushed to me, took my card and told me I must put in my cellphone number. “I asked ‘since when do you need to put in cellphone number?’ What he wanted me to do is put in my pin number. Everything happened so fast.” She said she only realised the two guys were together when they started talking to each other. “I tried cancelling everything, but the guy was pressurising me to put in my pin. I didn’t even notice that my card was not in the machine. “I think people in the queue saw what was happening and called mall security guards, and the guys left. Someone, who works at the mall, told me that this always happens on holidays and women are the targets. “I was lucky that the woman behind me gave me the bank number to call, which I did and cancelled my card before they could do anything with it,” she said. Banha realised later that if she had told the guy she was going to deposit money he probably would have taken her bag, which he thought contained the money. She said she never suspected they were there to rob because they were as well dressed as everyone else in the queue. Numerous attempts were made to get comment from the mall but nothing was forthcoming at the time going to print. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
