Counterprotesters marched through the city on Saturday to the historic Boston Common, where conservatives were to deliver speeches. The group, the Boston Free Speech Coalition, had publicly distanced itself from the neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville. Conservative activists and supporters soon left as counterprotesters chanted slogans and waved signs that said "Make Nazis Afraid Again" and "Love your neighbor". Police say the rallies, the largest of about a half dozen across the US on Saturday, drew about 40 000 people. The event was mostly peaceful, with 33 arrests made for disorderly conduct or assaulting police officers.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
