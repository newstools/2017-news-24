 The family of kidnapped Woodstock businessman Zhaun Ahmed (71) is reportedly under strain following numerous phone calls allegedly demanding a ransom.  Family spokesperson Hanif Loonat says that contact has been ongoing since last week but that the content cannot be discussed.  “The family is distressed. We ask that anyone who can assist please contact the investigating officer. We are in shock, we never expected something like this to happen to our family. There has been ongoing contact from his kidnappers since the weekend but we cannot say anything about that.” Asked whether Ahmed, the father of six, had any enemies that would want to hurt him or his family, Loonat says: “This is a close knit family. That is all I can say now.” Last week, police reported that the victim and his driver were busy in his vehicle when an unknown double cab bakkie pulled up behind them. Three men got out of the bakkie and allegedly threatened the victim with a firearm, forcing him into the bakkie. They drove off in the direction of Victoria Road, Woodstock. Reasons for the alleged kidnapping are still unknown.  Provincial police spokesperson, Captain FC Van Wyk, says police are following all possible leads. The case is currently under ­investigation.
