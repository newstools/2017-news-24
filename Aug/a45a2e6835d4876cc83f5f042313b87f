Gary Barnes (25) will spend 14 months behind bars, after his fake calls of threat caused panic and fear in the staff and learners of Tonacliffe Primary School in Whitworth, England. Barnes made the disturbing calls two weeks before Christmas last year. Officials were rushed to the school on 9 December to search the premises for any threats and more than 300 students and 45 staff members had to be evacuated in the process. Four days later, the 25-year-old made a second call, threatening to fetch his daughter, ‘armed with a gun’. The father-of-two pleaded guilty to four charges of bomb threats and intimidating phone calls. He was sentenced to 14 months in prison on Monday. “Mitigating is problematic because when you ask him why he did it he can’t really explain his actions,” John Didsbury, mitigating, said during the trial. “The only motivation appears to be that his daughter attends the school and he wanted to spend more time with her. “In some bizarre fashion, that communicated into him doing this in order to have her back home.” Sources: metro.co.uk, mirror.co.uk 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
