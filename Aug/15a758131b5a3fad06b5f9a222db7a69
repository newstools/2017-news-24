A WOMAN accused of drug trafficking was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment in the Verulam District Court after being convicted of dealing in drugs recently. Yudi Yanet Fernandez, who is Peruvian national, was arrested in May last year when she passed through King Shaka International Airport with drugs in her possession. In a statement sent to the media, the National Prosecuting Authority said: “On investigation, it was discovered that she had 1.4kg of Cocaine hidden in a compartment in her luggage.” During the trial, district court prosecutor Drushantha Ramsamy led the evidence of three witnesses, namely two South African Police Service (SAPS) officials and a South African Revenue Service member. In aggravation of sentence, Ramsamy told the court that drugs do not only affect the user but the society at large as these users eventually resort to criminal activities to feed their habit. She also asked the court, in sentencing the accused, to send out a strong message to would-be drug mules. Director of Public Prosecutions in KZN, Advocate Moipone Noko said in a statement: “I welcome both the conviction and sentence in this matter. It should go a long way in addressing the problem of drug dealing and usage that we are finding in the community.” - Supplied. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
