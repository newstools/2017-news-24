	     Imagine you’re sitting comfortably in a seemingly peaceful garden, when suddenly you hear something . . . A strange rustling... A bird? A mouse? You keep hearing the suspicious noise but see nothing.  What could it possibly be? Some in Queensland, Australia, recently experienced exactly that – and when they realised what it was, they called Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers 24/7 for help.  The company took to Facebook to post a picture of the enormous serpent who managed to sneak up on the unsuspecting homeowner. They cheekily captioned the snap: “Alright, guys, it’s time for another spot the snake.  "Top points for the species too!” Their post generated plenty of interest, garnering hundred of comments from intrepid snake spotters.  "I can't spot the snake and I've been staring at this picture for 10 min," one frustrated commenter wrote. "I give up!" Many seemed to think the black hose on the lawn was the snake – but it’s not that easy!   Here’s a clue: it’s somewhere in the right of the picture. Still don’t see it? Worry not – here it is! Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers identified it as a coastal carpet python. Though large, they’re not venomous and generally not dangerous to humans – though they have been known to occasionally dine on an unlucky Australian house cat.
