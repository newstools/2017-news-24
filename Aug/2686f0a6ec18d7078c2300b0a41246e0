The commander, Captain Vuyo Dolosi, was driving when he spotted five men in a vehicle trying to rob a 22-year-old man in Main Road, Nomathamsanqa, said Captain Gerda Swart. The men sped off with the policeman hot on their heels. “The chase ended a few metres from the Addo police station after other police officers barricaded the road,” she said. After being interviewed, the men apparently revealed that they robbed four other people of their cellphones the same evening. The phones were confiscated. Swart said they would investigate whether the men could be linked to more cases. The men, aged 20 to 40, would appear in the Addo Magistrate’s Court on Monday. She said Dolosi was commended for his vigilance and placing himself on duty. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
