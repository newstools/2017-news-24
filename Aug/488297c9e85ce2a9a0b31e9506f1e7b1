Du Plessis said the matter was ready to be transferred to the High Court in Johannesburg. Mantsoe is accused of killing his girlfriend Karabo Mokoena. He is also accused of defeating the ends of justice. Mokoena's body was found burnt beyond recognition in a veld in Lyndhurst, Johannesburg, in April.
