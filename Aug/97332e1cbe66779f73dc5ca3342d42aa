	     Pretoria – The so-called 'dagga couple', Julian Stobbs and Myrtle Clarke, will head back to the Pretoria High Court on Wednesday in a bid to have marijuana legalised. The couple believes the banned substance is not a gateway drug to other narcotics.  They previously aimed to raise R1.1m to bring cannabis experts to testify during the trial.  On their Indiegogo crowdfunding page, the couple said they have a list of international expert witnesses – including criminologists, sociologists, toxicologists and neuropsychopharmacologists – who are willing to come to South Africa and testify in court.  "Once the Constitutional Court has declared the laws unlawful (yes, we are very positive), we intend taking our case all the way to the International Court of Human Rights – taking every government in the world to task on this issue – so this plant never has to be put on trial again, anywhere in the world," they said.  Stobbs and Clarke were arrested at their home in 2010 for possession of dagga.  Also read: Why the South African state needs to lose its fight against marijuana policy reform  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
