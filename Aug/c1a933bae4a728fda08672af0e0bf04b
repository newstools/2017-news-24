	     Johannesburg – Eight City of Johannesburg employees were arrested for allegedly committing fraud amounting to about R2.4 million, the Hawks said on Friday.  The eight, and one other person, allegedly created fraudulent letters demanding rebates on behalf of property owners, spokesperson Robert Netshiunda said in a statement. Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba said in certain instances, property owners colluded with the officials to inflate refunds due to them. Once the refunds were processed, they would be paid into individual bank accounts, leaving them to share the money among themselves, Mashaba said in a statement.  He said the figure was expected to rise as the investigation progressed. “Residents who collude with officials and steal from the city must face the consequences,” Mashaba said.  The group would appear in the Johannesburg Specialised Commercial Crime Court on Monday on charges of theft and fraud.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
