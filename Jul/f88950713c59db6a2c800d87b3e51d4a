Citing "well-placed security sources", the newspaper said early results of an investigation "show a strong link between the head of the terrorist cell" and Coulibaly, who in 2015 killed a municipal police officer then four hostages in a Jewish supermarket in Paris before being killed. The alleged head of the Algerian cell, Mohamed Yacine Aknouche, was sentenced by a French court in 2004 to eight years in prison for taking part in a failed plan to blow up a Christmas market in the eastern city of Strasbourg. The French-Algerian dual national was arrested Tuesday along with a minor and a third person whose identity has not been revealed, in Ain Tagourait, 60km west of Algiers, Al-Khabar said. During a raid on Aknouche's apartment, security forces found "dozens of photos" of places he was hoping to attack, including army installations, it said. Algerian security forces are "trying to determine the type of relationship" between Aknouche and Coulibaly after discovering electronic conversations between the two men, Al-Khabar said. It said the investigation had uncovered a link between Aknouche and "murderous attacks in European countries... committed by Daesh", an Arabic acronym for ISIS. Algerian authorities declined to give AFP further details. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
