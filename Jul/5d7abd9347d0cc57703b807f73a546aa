	     Durban – KwaZulu-Natal police are searching for five suspects who robbed a Durban North bed and breakfast establishment on Tuesday evening. The five suspects entered the B&B premises at about 19:15 under the pretext of booking for accommodation, said Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane on Wednesday. "They then held up the owner and his wife at gunpoint while assaulting them. They also assaulted two maids and a guest," Zwane said. The suspects took cash, cellphones, a laptop and a printer before they escaped in a getaway vehicle, he said. Zwane said the matter was reported at the Durban North police station for further investigation.  "We appeal to anyone who might have information about their [suspects] whereabouts to come forward with information or call our Crime Stop number 08600 10111," Zwane added.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
