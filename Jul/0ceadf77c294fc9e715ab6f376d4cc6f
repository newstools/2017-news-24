Residents tied sheets together and threw them out the window in a desperate attempt to escape."What is disturbing is this fire in this particular building is not going to be an isolated case unless civil society can allow me as executive mayor to condemn these buildings and get people out so that we can actually save their lives," said Mashaba.AS IT HAPPENED: Joburg building declared a crime scene after deadly blaze kills 7Court battleGauteng police spokesperson Kay Makhubele said the bodies of some victims were burnt beyond recognition.An inquest docket would be opened to determine the cause of the fire.MMC for public safety Michael Sun said they were negotiating with the private building owner to take charge.It was understood that there was an ongoing court battle.Sun said these buildings were extremely dangerous because people were using illegal electrical connections."Yet we find women, the sick and elderly occupying the buildings."He said public safety and disaster management officials would provide the victims with food, clothing, blankets and emergency shelter.Mashaba, however, took a slightly different tone, saying the occupants could not expect to jump any housing lists.They were not going to allow anyone to hijack buildings thinking that they can jump the queue."If you are looking for a house and believe you qualify, please register on the list."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
