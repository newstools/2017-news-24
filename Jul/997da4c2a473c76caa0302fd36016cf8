Send us your eyewitness accounts and photos.  Organisations, activists, school children and community members voiced their objection to the "extreme security measures" at Islam's third holiest site. Mandla Mandela, the grandson of Nelson Mandela, joined the protesters. Israel began removing metal detectors from entrances to the major Jerusalem shrine early on Tuesday morning to defuse a crisis over the site that angered the Muslim world and triggered some of the worst Israeli-Palestinian clashes in years. Israel initially erected the metal detectors after Arab gunmen killed two policemen from inside the shrine, holy to Muslims and Jews, earlier this month. The Palestinian Health Ministry says three Palestinians have died so far, with many more injured.
