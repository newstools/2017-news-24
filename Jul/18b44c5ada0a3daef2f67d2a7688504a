Omar Maalim alleged that government agencies were responsible for the deaths as part of a crackdown on extremism."All this is being done by the Kenya Defence Forces, because we have information that these five people were picked from their houses by the military before being held briefly at the Fino police station," he said.Maalim said Mandera County Commissioner Fredrick Shisia had confirmed to him in a phone call that the five were among 11 people arrested Friday night. He added that there is a high rate of mysterious murders in the county.Kenyan security officials could not be reached for comment on the allegations.The country's security forces have long been accused of killing suspected extremists because they are unable to investigate them and get them prosecuted successfully.
