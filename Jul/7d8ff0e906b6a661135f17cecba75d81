	     Pretoria – The Department of Correctional Services (DCS) says a Kgosi Mampuru II official and a prisoner were injured after violence erupted at the correctional facility on Sunday. DCS spokesperson Logan Maistry said on Monday officials brought the situation under control, and there have since been no reports of any further incidents. On Sunday, Kgosi Mampuru II officials and prisoners clashed after they had refused to go into their cells. "They were requested repeatedly to return to their cells, but refused to do so. The inmates then started attacking officials, and in the process one official and one inmate sustained slight injuries," Maistry said. Maistry said in line with relevant legislation, minimum force was utilised to restore order at the centre. Delays processing parole applications A video of the altercation emerged on Monday morning on TimesLive. In the video, prisoners are forcefully dragged to their cells by officials. Some are seen lying on the ground while fellow inmates pull them away from the prison warders. "This matter will be reported accordingly to the inspecting judge, as well as relevant law enforcement agencies, for the necessary investigations to be conducted." Maistry said that the inmates have concerns over the systematic delays in processing parole applications, particularly for those doing life sentences. He said prisoners from three Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal correctional centres handed a memorandum over to Justice Minister Michael Masutha listing their complaints about poor food, parole, overcrowding and violence meted out by warders.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
