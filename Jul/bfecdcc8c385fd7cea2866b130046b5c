	     Cape Town - A drunk driver and his female passenger assaulted two Metro Police officers when they tried to take him into custody, the City of Cape Town said on Monday. Two officers pulled the man over in Mfuleni around 08:30 on Saturday after he ignored a stop sign. They suspected he may have been under the influence, and a sobriety test confirmed it. "While arresting the suspect, he resisted and started assaulting the officer. His female passenger then started assaulting the other officer," the city said in a statement. "The 22-year-old woman was eventually restrained and joined the driver behind bars on charges of assaulting a police officer, obstruction of justice, resisting arrest, and riotous behaviour." Twenty-four people were arrested for drunk driving over the weekend. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
