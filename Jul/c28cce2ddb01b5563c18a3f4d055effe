This is a big number that neither the oil sector nor the budget can handle," he said at a press conference.But despite widespread consternation among Egyptians, it is unlikely that the soaring cost of living will lead to unrest, El Shenety said."The government's conviction that there will not be a backlash by people allowed it to make these reforms forcibly," he said.Economic grievances had fuelled the 2011 uprising that overthrew veteran strongman Hosni Mubarak, ushering in years of unrest that decimated tourism and investment.Many Egyptians now are weary of further unrest, while the government shows little tolerance for dissent, having jailed thousands of Islamists and secular dissidents over the past few years.President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the former army chief who toppled his Islamist predecessor Mohamed Morsi in 2013, has said the country has no choice but to undertake the tough economic reforms his predecessors had put off, fearing unrest.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
