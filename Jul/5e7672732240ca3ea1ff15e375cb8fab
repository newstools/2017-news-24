Today, we have positions that go in the right direction," Bourita said.Morocco and the Polisario fought for control of Western Sahara from 1974 to 1991, when Rabat took over the desert territory before the signing of the UN-brokered ceasefire.Rabat, which considers Western Sahara an integral part of Morocco, proposes autonomy for the resource-rich territory, but the Polisario insists on an independence referendum.Some African countries consider Morocco's claim to Western Sahara to be a form of colonialism.The UN Security Council in May endorsed new peace talks between Morocco and Polisario, while renewing for a year the mandate of MINURSO, its peacekeeping mission in the disputed region.Polisario said it was ready to negotiate with Morocco but wanted the AU to be involved as well.Bourita said the AU's role in the talks should only be to recognise whatever agreement is reached via the UN.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
