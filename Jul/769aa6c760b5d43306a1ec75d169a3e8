Inhabitants of the city in Britanny were amazed by the display, prompting the the French businessman to transform it into an annual exhibition.The aim of the festival is to make the public think about the future of the planet.&nbsp;Every summer, pictures ornament the walls of the town until the last day of September."Whether the focus is thousand-year-old forests, oceans or civilisations, there will always be a photographer on hand to expose the dangers they face," the website says.At least 400 000 visitors are expected this year.&nbsp;Several artists from the African continent are staging their work, including Nigeria's Akintude Akinleye, Congolese Sammy Baloji and Fatoumata&nbsp;Diabat&eacute; from Mali.The pictures depict various challenges affecting Africa - from petrol issues in Nigeria to the accidents in copper mines&nbsp;in in the Democratic Republic of Congo ."Each piece of work references to a tradition. Portraits are someone's pride. Sometimes, it is the only present you can send to your family when you are abroad," Kwame Leduc, administrator of&nbsp;Fatoumata Diabat&eacute; studios, explains."Making a tribute to her ancestor." Fatoumata takes portraits inside Gacilly's town to recreate the atmosphere of the streets of Bamako. Photo by Fatoumata Diabate&nbsp;Another famous African artist exhibiting at Gacilly&rsquo;s festival is&nbsp;Brent Stirton, a South African born in Durban in 1969. Since 2008, Stirton has been working with National Geographic to denounce African and Asian poaching.&nbsp;"When I work, I spend 90% of my time investigating. Taking pictures is the easy part," Stirton said in an interview with a French newspaper, LeMonde.See some of the pictures below.&nbsp;Photo by Brent Stirton/Courtesy of Getty ImagesPhoto by Brent Stirton/Courtesy of Getty ImagesWorld Press Photo: @BrentStirton takes 1st-prize for Nature stories with 'Rhino Wars' - https://t.co/ZrHI9Ayzq7 pic.twitter.com/AMpdMoJRKZAnother year another superb, thought-provoking,moving outdoor photo festival - thank you @LaGacillyPhoto #iloveafrica pic.twitter.com/mDplbVAqL1Un jeune photographe &eacute;thiopien au Festival photo de La Gacilly. https://t.co/YTA5dJ94Hi24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
