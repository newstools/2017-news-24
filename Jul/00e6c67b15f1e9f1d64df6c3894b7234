The DA has also asked that they be dismissed with costs.The party had been fighting for more than eight years for Zuma to "have his day in court", Selfe said.'What the NPA is doing, I don't know'In June, DA leader Mmusi Maimane asked Zuma during a question session in Parliament why it had taken the NPA 1 200 days to investigate the charges Maimane had re-laid."I think the honourable member is asking the wrong person. You did not lay the charges against me to investigate," Zuma replied."What the NPA is doing, I don't know."...Why you are asking me, I'm not investigating. You should go to where you made the charges and ask why it is taking long. You are asking the wrong person."The full bench of the North Gauteng High Court ruled in April 2016 that the decision to discontinue the prosecution against the president should be reviewed and set aside.The decision to drop the charges, taken by former NPA head Mokotedi Mpshe in 2009, was "irrational", the court said.The Constitutional Court in October 2016 refused to hear the NPA's appeal on the judgment for the time being, saying it would not be in the interests of justice to hear the matter at that stage.It needed to go through the Supreme Court of Appeal first.The DA has previously argued that Zuma and the NPA's appeals have no reasonable chance of success, and that the appeals are a time-wasting tactic. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
