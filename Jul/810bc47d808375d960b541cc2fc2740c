Nobody will go short of grass while I am MP."While some have blamed the increase in land invasions on the drought others argue the reasons are more complex.There is increased competition for land and resources as a result of population growth and a massive increase in the number of livestock.But there is also growing anger over historical land injustices. The region has enormous tracts of land owned by white settlers and Kenyan elites.The approach of next month's presidential, parliamentary and local elections has also increased political tension.Lempurkel is due in court on Monday could face fresh charges.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
