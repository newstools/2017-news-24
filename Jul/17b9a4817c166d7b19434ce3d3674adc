Sch&auml;fer said the amended bill also allows for the establishment of an evaluation authority which will be known as the Western Cape Schools Evaluation Authority. "The [authority] will independently evaluate schools and develop school evaluation reports which will trigger departmental support and developmental actions," she said. She said the authority will be financed by private funding and believes it will be fully operational by the 2018/19 financial year. "We have piloted this model in 42 schools already and have received very positive feedback."The amended bill also forces all provincial public schools to make a request, in writing, to the head of the provincial education department if it wishes to sell or allow for the consumption of alcohol on school property. Sch&auml;fer said the draft amended bill will be published in the provincial gazette.From there, provincial parliament will consider comments and consult external stakeholders, before the bill is reworked, if necessary, and voted in as provincial legislation.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
