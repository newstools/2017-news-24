But it said there was no public participation in the choice of Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing and that the electoral commission did not follow procurement rules.The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission had argued there isn't enough time to issue the contract to another firm. The judges disagreed.The National Super Alliance presidential candidate Raila Odinga has accused Kenyatta of influencing the awarding of the contract.Odinga claims the firm is colluding with the president to print extra ballot papers for electoral fraud.Kenyatta has denied the claims and accused the opposition of trying to sabotage the August 8 elections. Observers already have warned of the possibility of violence around the elections as in past years.Kenyatta beat former prime minister Odinga in 2013 with 50.07 percent of the vote, narrowly avoiding a runoff election.
