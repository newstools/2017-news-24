	     Groblersdal – The grandson of a 79-year-old woman has been arrested in connection with her murder in Rooseenekal, Limpopo police said on Sunday. "It is alleged that the deceased…was attacked and killed while sleeping in her house by unknown people who used a variety of objects," said Lieutenant Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe. The woman’s body was found in her home just outside Groblersdal in May this year. However, police only made the first arrest this weekend – and revealed the alleged family connection behind the murder. A police investigation revealed that the grandson and another family member had disappeared after the grandmother’s funeral. A manhunt was then launched, which led to the arrest in Mpumulanga. "Preliminary investigations have further uncovered that the motive behind this incident was a conspiracy to kill the deceased to acquire her property valued for millions of rands," said Ngoepe. Another arrest is imminent, said police. The suspect will appear in the Groblersdal Magistrate's Court on Monday on a charge of murder. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba thanked dedicated police for cracking such a complicated matter within a short space of time. "Members of the community must refrain and stop this tendency of killing each other for money or for any other benefit, and also to try and mislead the police, because they can't hide and we will take such people to where they belong," said Ledwaba. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
