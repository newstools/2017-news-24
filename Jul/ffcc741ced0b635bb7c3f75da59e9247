All of them were stabilised and taken to several local hospitals in and around the Durban area by ambulances," said Robert McKenzie of the KwaZulu-Natal Emergency Medical Services (KZN EMS).According to Netcare 911, 45 commuters in the minibus taxis required medical assistance at the scene, though the majority of injuries were minor in nature.McKenzie told News24 that police were on the scene to investigate, and that the cause of the accident was not known yet. He asked road users to be vigilant and refrain from doing anything that would impede their driving."With no prejudice to this case, it is pay weekend so it's a traditionally busy time for EMS; so we would like to remind people to please be cautious on the road, and to not drink alcohol before or while driving a motor vehicle," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
