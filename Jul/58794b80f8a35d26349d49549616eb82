Jackie Kruger, Netwerk24 George - The remains of two of the five horses which were chased into a plantation during the recent devastating Knysna fires have been found, Netwerk24 reported. At least one survived – Cody, who had been badly burnt and was found walking home along the N2 16 days after the fire. The remains of Cheeky and Bella were found on Sunday after a large-scale search in which people on horseback and others in 4x4s had taken part. A huge area was covered.  Two other ponies, Mila en Déjà Vu, are still missing. According to their owner, Karen Rademeyer, the dead ponies were found in the plantation, south of the farm on Sunday. "It seems as if everything happened very quickly and the ponies didn't suffer," she said.When the fires broke out on June 7, Cody and his four friends were chased into a nearby plantation because, amid all the chaos, they wouldn’t let anyone catch them.All the other horses on Rademeyer's farm along the N2 between the turn-off to Rheenendal and Buffalo Bay were led to safety in time.At that stage, the plantation wasn't burning yet.Rademeyer thought they would find the ponies there again. However, the wind turned and the spot the horses had last been seen, burned for four days.  Cody made his appearance on June 23, badly burnt and tired. The ponies had initially been wild and lived on the farm when Rademeyer bought it a few years ago. She says Cody, who is being treated by a vet, is recovering well.  "Mainly his face was badly burnt, but it is healing well," she added. Rademeyer says she thinks the other two horses might have crossed the N2 and the search for them continues. They can be anywhere from Brenton to Groenvlei, or even more inland in the direction of Elandskraal and Barrington.
