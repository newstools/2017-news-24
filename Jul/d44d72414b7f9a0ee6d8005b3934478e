The conflict broke out when ethnic African rebels took up arms against Khartoum's Arab-dominated government, accusing it of marginalising Darfur.Thousands more were killed in Blue Nile and South Kordofan when similar conflicts broke out in the two states in 2011.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
