It is disingenuous for her to pretend to care now that she&rsquo;s been singled out for not doing her job. She cannot shift her responsibility. She, and she alone, must make the decision and it must be rational."He reiterated opposition parties' call for Mbete to recuse herself from presiding over the debate on the motion."The Speaker has a long history of showing bias in her slavish defence of President Zuma," he said.Mbete indicated over the weekend that she would not recuse herself. On previous occasions she denied accusations of bias and refused to recuse herself.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
