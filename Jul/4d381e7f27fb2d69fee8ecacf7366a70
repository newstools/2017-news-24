Songezo Ndude reportedly died in Groote Schuur Hospital on Tuesday.&nbsp; He was shot on Monday morning and was initially treated at Victoria Hospital in Wynberg. It was unclear who had shot him, and the unrest led to paramedics having difficulty getting to the scene.&nbsp; Western Cape Health Emergency Medical Services spokesperson, Robert Daniels, said they were only able to arrive within 30 minutes. Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini said on Wednesday the directorate was awaiting the outcome of a post mortem to determine the cause of death. This was scheduled for Wednesday, but a backlog at the mortuary resulted in it being postponed. The directorate was conducting a preliminary investigation, he explained, and should it be found that the man died of a gunshot wound, Ipid would fully probe the incident. Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana confirmed the fatality, adding that the circumstances were being investigated. "This investigation will be handed over to Ipid," she said.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
