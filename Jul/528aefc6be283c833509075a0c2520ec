"We hope that the successful outcome of this review application will leave no one in doubt that in taking this case up the board acted to curb corruption," the Prasa board said in a statement on Monday. The contract, awarded to little-known company Swifambo Rail Leasing in 2013, became mired in controversy after an expos&eacute; by Rapport newspaper which detailed Afro 4000 locomotives' unsuitability for local rail lines. In handing down judgment, Judge J Francis remarked: "Harm will be done to the administration of justice if this award is not set aside from the onset. Corruption will triumph of this court does not set aside the tender."Also read:&nbsp;Molefe: Board 'vindicated' by Prasa court rulingThe Prasa board thanked "all the honest and brave Prasa employees who brought these acts of malfeasance to light".
