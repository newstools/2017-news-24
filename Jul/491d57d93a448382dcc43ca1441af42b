Abramjee took to social media on Friday, lambasting Saica for only allowing black and coloured students access to its bursary fund. In his tweet, Ambramjee asked Saica why it was excluding Indian students. Saica said that, when comparing the Saica member statistics of all race groups, it found that whites and Indians "surpass their representation in the Chartered Accounting profession". "Whereas Africans and Coloureds were lagging seriously and generationally behind." Saica said this prompted them to make "a conserted effort... to increasing Africans and Coloureds numbers to be reflective of the EAP demographics through the formation of the Thuthuka Bursary Fund". "Thuthuka is the only bursary fund that has this targeted approach. Many accounting and auditing firms give bursaries to all BCom students wanting to become chartered accountants," Saica said. In response, Abramjee said that he was of the view that the exclusion of Indian South Africans was discriminatory. "I will consider taking this matter to the South African Human Rights Commission."    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
