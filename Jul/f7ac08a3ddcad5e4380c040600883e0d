It could not have been that public funds are misused by corrupt officials and people with self-serving interests," he said.Maswanganyi further said that government was "committed to deal decisively with fraud and corruption, and will do everything in law to root out these acts of dishonesty and criminality wherever they emerge".Swifambo were directed to pay the costs of the court application including the employment of three counsel. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
