Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini said four people are understood to have hit the cab at about 07:00, fleeing the scene in the direction of Grassy Park. Police were alerted and pursued the car, which came to a stop on Strandfontein Road in Ottery. "Four [officers] approached the hijacked vehicle and one of the suspects allegedly pointed a firearm towards them. In return, two SAPS members fired several gunshots towards the hijacked vehicle. The suspects then sped away," he said. The suspects stopped the hijacked vehicle about 500m away from where the shooting occurred.
