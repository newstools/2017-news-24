The agents of racism that claim to stand for media freedom are the biggest threat to freedom, including media freedom."The statement said while BLF had not taken away anyone's right to speak out, it had been gagged.READ: Parliamentary committee slams intimidation of journalistsSAHRC concernOn Monday the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) also expressed its concern about the intimidation of journalists."The commission therefore calls on the BFLF group to immediately cease intimidating and harassing journalists and further calls on this group, and on all who reside within the republic, to respect and protect the media&rsquo;s right to operate without fear or favour," reads the SAHRC's statement.BLF tweeted that they were not surprised that the SAHRC "only believes that whites are human".On Tuesday morning the South African National Editors Forum asked the High Court for an urgent interdict to prevent BLF from intimidating the 11 journalists it publicly stated it would "deal with".BLF is led by Andile Mngxitama, a former Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) MP and a fervent supporter of the controversial Gupta family.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
