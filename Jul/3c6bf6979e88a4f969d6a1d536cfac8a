At about 01:30, a white minibus drove with quite a speed through the street and through a group of people, hitting at least six of them," he said.It was not clear how the taxi got through the blockade.Two 14-year-old girls died on the scene. A 19-year-old boy was declared dead on arrival at the hospital.Beetge said their families were streaming into the mortuary on Monday morning to identify the bodies.Two teenagers were transferred to Livingstone Hospital, while two brothers - 13 and 14 - were later discharged.The minibus was later found abandoned in Missionvale."The owner told police that the vehicle was stationary by 21:00 that night and that, for some reason, the driver took it without his knowledge."Officers had visited the driver's home, but he was not there.Beetge said they were hopeful of making an arrest soon.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
