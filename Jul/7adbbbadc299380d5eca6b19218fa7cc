	     Cape Town – The inspector general of intelligence and police watchdog IPID have agreed on how to work together to better fight corruption. “We understand that the nature of our work requires a multi-disciplinary approach in order to win the fight against corruption,” Independent Police Investigative Directorate head Robert McBride said in a statement on Thursday. “More can be achieved through working together rather than working against each other,” he said. The IGI, Setlhomamaru Dintwe, and McBride on Thursday signed a memorandum of understanding to regulate the relationship between the two institutions. It would be used to guide joint investigations. The IGI is established under the Constitution to oversee the country’s intelligence services. The IPID investigates allegations of criminal conduct by police. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
