Charnell? She is a kitchen assistant in Observatory and now she's an expert. She doesn't know what the budget of the city council is; she doesn't know what money they get."She doesn't know this stuff, she is a kitchen assistant."Eviction&nbsp;The applicants in the matter face eviction after the Woodstock property they have been staying in was sold to private developers to build upmarket apartments, which they would not be able to afford.The City of Cape Town said it could only accommodate the residents in Wolwerivier, about a 30-minute drive from the Cape Town city centre.The residents, however, felt Wolwerivier was too far away from their children's schools, work opportunities and public transport.They are seeking an order declaring that the City has a constitutional obligation to provide them with emergency accommodation in an area as close as is feasibly possible to their homes.The matter is set to be heard afresh in September 2017.WATCH: Gentrification is destroying lives - Woodstock residents facing eviction&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
