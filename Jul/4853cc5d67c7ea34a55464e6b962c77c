The SIU investigation will therefore uncover the rot that leads back to Zuma's front door."One of the "questionable" deals referred to by the ad hoc committee was one with the Gupta-owned The New Age newspaper. The others were deals with MultiChoice, SekelaXabiso, Vison View and Foxton."The EFF calls on Mr Zuma to sign the proclamation for the SIU to investigate the rot at the SABC and recover all the monies due to the public broadcaster," Ndlozi said."There is no point sitting in an ANC policy conference, telling people that your government is ready to deal with corruption, when you delay to sign declarations that combat the same corruption. Justice delayed is justice denied."READ: New communications minister gives SABC interim board green lightIn June, the SABC interim board reported back to Parliament on the steps they had taken to turn the SABC around.
