Lethiwe Makhanya IN the past few months some Pietermaritzburg suburbs have experienced power failure, which led to some residents protesting, demanding they get electricity back. Residents said they have also complained because they have not been notified by the municipality about the electricity failure. Recently Msunduzi Mayor, Themba Njilo, apologised in local newspapers for the power failure revealing that in some areas it was caused by disruption at the Hilton substation. This was confirmed by Msunduzi spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha who said the substation has now been fixed. Mafumbatha said municipality is now experiencing major problems with illegal connections across the city which leads to power failure. “Illegal connections is a big problem in Msunduzi and its affects the whole city. Areas like Jika Joe, Mkondeni and other areas across the city all have illegal connections. “Every time we find out about the illegal connections we disconnect them, but people continue doing it. The municipality condemns these illegal connections in the strongest terms. “We appeal to communities to report illegal connections as they are destroying our infrastructure,” Mafumbatha said. She also urged residents to use electricity wisely. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
