However, in March this year, the government revoked this idea, following a ruling by the High Court in Pretoria in February which stipulated that a withdrawal would be unconstitutional and invalid &ndash; and needed to be taken to Parliament. In June this year, it was reported that the ANC's subcommittee on international relations declared that the party's decision that South Africa should withdraw from the International Criminal Court still stood, although consultations on the matter continued.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
