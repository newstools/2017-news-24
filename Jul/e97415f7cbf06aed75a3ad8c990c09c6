The management of OR Tambo International Airport said the shootout with police and security guards occurred on Saturday at a highway ramp after robbers allegedly fled from the airport's Swissport warehouse in a seized cargo truck. In March, thieves using what authorities said was a marked police vehicle took at least $1.5m in a heist at the airport. Detained suspects included a police constable and members of a private security company. Authorities at the airport also are investigating whether any workers there have helped robbers who follow arriving travellers and mug them at their homes or other destinations. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
