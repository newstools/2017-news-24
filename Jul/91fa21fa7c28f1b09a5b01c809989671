"The army has become a highly politicized body."The international community's efforts to depoliticize the army after the country's long civil war "are being obliterated," the report adds.Burundi's government on Tuesday denounced the report, saying the local groups that helped produce it are not officially recognised."This is fake. They are mercenaries who work for some foreign people who want to destroy our country," said Therence Natahiraja, assistant spokesperson for the interior ministry.The government has previously denied a campaign of repression and harassment of Tutsi army officers.The war in Burundi started in 1993 when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the country's first democratically elected president, a Hutu. Fighting mainly between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi-dominated army resulted in the deaths of 300 000 people. A cease-fire was declared in 2006 but it took several years for fighting to end.The latest violence erupted in April 2015 after President Pierre Nkurunziza announced his intention to seek a disputed third term that he ultimately won. More than 500 people have been killed, according to the United Nations, although some rights groups say at least 1 000 have died.Tutsis make up 14% of Burundi's 10 million people, while Hutus are about 85% of the population.Burundi's government has accused neighboring Rwanda, which has a similar ethnic composition, of supporting rebels opposed to Nkurunziza. Rwanda's government denies it. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
