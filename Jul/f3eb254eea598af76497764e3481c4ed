"Land reform in Zimbabwe is a continuous process and what was witnessed at Lesbury Farm should not be seen as a fresh farm invasion, but the enforcement of a High Court order by the Sheriff of the High Court," Mujati was quoted as saying.He continued: "Zanu-PF had no hand whatsoever in the enforcement of the order. I, Joseph Mujati, the Zanu-PF vice-chairperson for Manicaland, can confirm I was not anywhere near Lesbury Farm neither was Zanu-PF represented in any capacity by anyone on this particular day."&nbsp;News24 reported this week that more than 150 farm workers had been rendered homeless following the violent eviction.They appealed to Mugabe&rsquo;s government to allow their former employer to return to the farm, saying working at Lesbury Estates was their only source of livelihood.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
