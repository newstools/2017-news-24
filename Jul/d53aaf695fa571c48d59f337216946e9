The inmates then started attacking officials, and in the process one official and one inmate sustained slight injuries," Maistry said.Maistry said in line with relevant legislation, minimum force was utilised to restore order at the centre.Delays processing parole applicationsA video of the altercation emerged on Monday morning on TimesLive.In the video, prisoners are forcefully dragged to their cells by officials. Some are seen lying on the ground while fellow inmates pull them away from the prison warders."This matter will be reported accordingly to the inspecting judge, as well as relevant law enforcement agencies, for the necessary investigations to be conducted."Maistry said that the inmates have concerns over the systematic delays in processing parole applications, particularly for those doing life sentences.He said prisoners from three Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal correctional centres handed a memorandum over to Justice Minister Michael Masutha listing their complaints about poor food, parole, overcrowding and violence meted out by warders.@Radio702 ,@ewnupdates - Prisoners trying to address their issues with wardens at kgosi Mampuru prison ,yesterday afternoon pic.twitter.com/IQRO6sgt90&mdash; Loretta Sanderson (@SandersonLorett) July 3, 2017@Radio702 ,@ewnupdates - Prisoners trying to address their issues with wardens at kgosi Mampuru prison ,yesterday afternoon pic.twitter.com/IQRO6sgt9024.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
