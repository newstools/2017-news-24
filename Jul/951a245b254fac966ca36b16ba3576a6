Then they appoint people to a selection committee who are illegitimate and create a shortlist where only one of the six candidates is coloured &ndash; when 11 coloured candidates applied,&rdquo; Pretorius said."Why wasn&rsquo;t the current caretaker even considered?"According to its website, Pasa is a political party formed for marginalised people such as coloureds, the Khoi San, and Indians. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
