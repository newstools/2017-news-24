(Prasa) controversial contract for new locomotives has been reviewed and set
aside by the High Court in Johannesburg. "Harm will be done to the administration of justice if
this award is not set aside from the onset. Corruption will triumph of this
court does not set aside the tender," the court said in its judgment. The contract, awarded to little-known company Swifambo Rail
Leasing in 2013, became mired in controversy after an exposé by Rapport
newspaper which detailed the Afro 4000 locomotives' unsuitability for local
rail lines. This is a developing story. Follow News24 for more details.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
