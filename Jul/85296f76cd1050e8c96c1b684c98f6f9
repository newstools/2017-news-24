However some passersby yelled derogatory comments at the gay pride marchers. No incidents were reported during the parade, which was escorted by police.While homosexuality is technically not illegal in Namibia, sodomy is criminalised and punishable by a jail term, though this law is rarely enforced.Same sex couples complain of discrimination and lack of legal protection in the event of domestic violence."The request is not for marriage. The request is for some legal protection to couples that live together," said Friedel Dausab, director of Out-Right Namibia an LGBTI organisation.While the march was the first such to be held in the capital, protests over discrimination against gays and lesbians have taken place previously in other Namibian towns.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
