KZN Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo must report to the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) and provide a plan to overcome the oncology crisis in the province. The report back by the MEC is one of the binding recommendations in the commission’s scathing report that found Dhlomo and his department guilty of human rights violations in that they failed to provide proper access and treatment to cancer patients at two of the province’s biggest public hospitals. Unfortunately, to date there is no indication that Dhlomo will meet any of these recommendations. During a sitting of the KZN Legislature last week, the MEC made a feeble attempt to reassure members of the provincial parliament and the public that matters are being dealt with. This is probably the same weak-kneed set of proposals he discussed during his meeting with the SAHRC on Monday, and should be viewed as a publicity stunt rather than offering real solutions. The reality is that, apart from an announcement about greater involvement from the private sector - one of the recommendations that was put forward by the DA - he failed to say anything new. The MEC has shown repeatedly that he is incapable of producing a plan to restore proper treatment for cancer sufferers. If he was, he would have done so a long time ago rather than allowing matters to reach the stage where he is now being compelled by the SAHRC to do something. He also continues to feign ignorance of the extensive investigation concluded by the SAHRC. The DA calls on the SAHRC not to tolerate any delays or excuses from the MEC and his department.
