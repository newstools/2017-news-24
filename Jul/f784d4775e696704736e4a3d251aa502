According to the state-owned Chronicle newspaper, Sandra Ncube, 21, Riamuhetsi Mlauzi, 23, and Mongiwe Mpofu,25, detained and raped an unnamed pastor after he had gone to their house in Cowdray park to collect money that he was owed by one of them. State prosecutor Petros Shoko said that on arrival, the pastor was forcibly touched on his private parts before two of the three women pinned him on the bed and forced him to have sex with the third. “Ncube had sexual intercourse with the complainant once, without his consent,” Shoko was quoted as saying. The trio, however, denied raping the pastor but admitted to indecently assaulting him. They were charged with aggravated indecent assault and were remanded in custody to August 7. This came as the Daily Mail reported on Tuesday that a 39-year-old teacher was hospitalised after he claimed that a gang of three women had kidnapped, drugged and raped him for two days. The man from Zimbabwe's Chitungwiza township was allegedly left with severely bruised private parts, the report said.       24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
