Police officers at the scene told a News24 reporter that no arrests had yet been made. Smoke was seen coming from inside the store. A fire truck arrived at the scene shortly afterwards. Central City Improvement District security manager Mo Hendricks said that a SAPS task force was dealing with the matter. Special task force members were seen filing into the store around 13:30. Hendricks said CCID officials were assisting by closing off the entire block to the public.
