	     Johannesburg - A desert area in South Africa that was inhabited during the Stone Age has been added to the United Nations world heritage (Unesco) list. Unesco announced in Poland at the weekend that the Khomani cultural landscape at South Africa's border with Botswana and Namibia testified to the way of life of the once-nomadic San people that influenced the area over thousands of years. Other African sites added to the list include an old royal capital in Angola and the Eritrean capital of Asmara.  Unesco said Mbanza Kongo in northwest Angola was the capital of the Kongo kingdom, a largely independent state between the 14th and 19th centuries. The UN cultural agency said Asmara, which experienced large-scale construction under Italian rule in the 1930s, showcases "early modernist urbanism" in an African context.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
