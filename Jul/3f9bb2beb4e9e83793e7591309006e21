The press coalition also expressed "concern" over the "harassment and pressure" it said journalists feel in Niger during the course of their work.Soumana was previously detained for 10 days in June 2016, along with Le Courrier director Moussa Dodo, before being handed a three-month suspended sentence for publishing documents implicating leading Nigerien figures in a scandal centred on how to pass the competitive test to become a government employee.Reporters Without Borders (RSF), which at the time called the detention a "witch hunt," has criticised Niger for its routine harsh treatment of journalists. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
