	     East London - Four years after 15-year-old Liyabona Makana disappeared from a Phakamisa initiation school, his parents have asked police to reopen their investigation to find their missing son. Makana was last seen visiting an initiate after leaving his home in Zone 8, Zwelitsha in King Williams Town in November 2013. The teen, dressed in red check shorts and white T-shirt, never returned home. Police spokesperson Siphokazi Mawisa said a search of the school, the homes of his friends and the surrounding neighbourhoods were searched to find him. No one has seen him since. Mawisa said the family had requested that the investigation into his disappearance be reopened because they hoped to find out what happened to him. Anyone able to shed light on his disappearance is urged to phone Constable Dineo Duma at Zwelitsha police on 040 655 1925, 073 365 1913 or 082 958 8816. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
