In a column he wrote about the surveillance and mentioned Mngxitama as a ''luckless land reformer'' who had tweeted to him, "You going to get a heart attack Peter; better prepare yourself" before the surveillance footage and personal information was published on a site complaining about white monopoly capital.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
