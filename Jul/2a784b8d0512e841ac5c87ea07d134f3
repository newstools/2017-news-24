	     After much blood, sweat and tears, Daily Maverick, Amabhungane and News24 present the #GuptaLeaks microsite. Think of it as your one-stop shop. Kind of like how the Guptas have treated the public purse. It’s been a few months since the #GuptaLeaks dropped and if you are suffering from leaks-fatigue, we get you. But we’d hate it if you missed anything. The last few months at Daily Maverick, amaBhungane and News24 have been all about sharing. It’s no coincidence that all of our logos contain some sprinklings of red: we believe in equal distribution of information. The microsite, a collaborative effort, features all the articles written on the leaks, additional biographies of the main kingpins and videos by Daily Maverick Chronicle for those not interested in reading. It’s easier to navigate than, say, a landing base at Waterkloof airport. Category navigation makes it easy to find specific stories on specific topics or involving specific people. No special permissions required. Whether you’ve missed something or even if you’re just feeling a little bit masochistic, head over to http://www.gupta-leaks.com and have a read. But make sure you’re sitting down.  • Scorpio is the Daily Maverick’s new investigative unit.
