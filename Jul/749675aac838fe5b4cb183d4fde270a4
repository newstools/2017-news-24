He will return at an undisclosed time for previously scheduled tests.ZNBC had earlier quoted the health minister as saying Kaunda had been suffering from "minor complaints."Kaunda led Zambia from independence from Britain in 1964 until 1991. Zambia was a one-party state for most of that time, although Kaunda eventually yielded to pressure and held a multi-party vote. He peacefully left office when he lost.Zambia's democratic record after Kaunda has been widely praised but the recent jailing of an opposition leader and increased police powers are raising concerns.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
