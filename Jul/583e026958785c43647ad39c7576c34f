The limousine sent to pick them up from the airport moved off before she'd got in.Grace Mugabe was speaking on Sunday at her 52nd birthday party.She also touched on drug abuse and "anti-social behaviour" by children, with the Chronicle reporting her saying that "young people were bound to be naughty at some point whether they were the president's children or not".It wasn't clear if that was a reference to her own two sons, Robert Junior and Bellarmine Chatunga, who were reportedly evicted from a luxury Sandton apartment in June for "unacceptable behaviour".&nbsp;The two of them were both at Sunday's party. A picture in the state-run Herald showed them by her side as she cut her birthday cake. Robert Junior is reportedly studying at the University of Johannesburg.See picture below.Grace Mugabe celebrating her 52nd birthday - 23 July 2017 pic.twitter.com/tBng7USVaF24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
