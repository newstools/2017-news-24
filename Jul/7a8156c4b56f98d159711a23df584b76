The latest development is a cause for concern as it extends the delay."Limpopo police said no one was injured in the fire. It was not clear what the cost of the damage was."There are elements of some human act. We call upon members of the community with information to contact us," said Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe.Forensics experts were compiling a report.Foul play&nbsp; Musina municipality spokesperson Wilson Dzebu confirmed there was a likelihood of foul play.Some documents and furniture were destroyed.He said application forms for housing were safely removed from the scene.Fires also broke out at two other premiers' offices last week.On Friday afternoon June 30, flames gutted an unused garage at the office of the Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle in Bhisho.Documents linked to a wide-ranging investigation into procurement in the province, dating back to 2010, were lost, provincial government spokesperson Sonwabo Mbananga said at the time.On Friday morning, the finance offices of the Gauteng premier's department were destroyed in a blaze, apparently due to an electrical fault.Almost 300 staff members were evacuated from the offices and no injuries were reported.Computers were destroyed but important documentation was backed up on another system, said provincial government spokesperson Thabo Masebe on Monday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
