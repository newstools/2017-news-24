	     Hwange - A massive decontamination exercise is under way near
Zimbabwe's famous Hwange National Park after a tanker transporting sulphuric
acid overturned spilling 30 000 litres of the dangerous chemical on the main
road, state radio reports. The chemical has seeped hundreds of metres from the crash
site, near Dete, and is now threatening a local river. "The spill has moved to a distance of about 300 metres from
the accident scene and just 50 metres from the community's water source," the
ZBC reported. Zambian truck The truck was Zambian-registered, the report said. Zimbabwe’s Environmental Management Agency arrived on the
scene of the accident within an hour, a source living near the area told
News24. The driver and his assistant were injured but rescued alive,
the source said. Decontamination pit As the authorities battle to minimise lasting environmental impact,
diggers have been brought in to excavate the contaminated soil and put it into
a decontamination pit with a neutralising agent. Volunteers and technicians are
helping in the exercise. Hazardous to skin Sulphuric acid can be hazardous to the skin if it comes into
contact with it. The authorities will be trying to stop the leak contaminating
water sources. In 2009 a tanker carrying sulphuric acid overturned and
spilled around 1 000 litres of the chemical outside the central mining town of
Kwekwe. Hwange National Park is where Cecil the lion lived before he
was killed in 2015. Cecil's son Xanda was also shot dead in the area by a
hunter early this month.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
