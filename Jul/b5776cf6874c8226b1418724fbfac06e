Villiers, who was found guilty on sexual assault charges, will take place in
the High Court in Johannesburg on Monday. His sentencing has been postponed a number of times. In February, De Villiers was found guilty on 32 of 38
charges, including raping a child, sexual assault, fraud, exposing children to
pornography, and accessing child pornography. The court found he was a poor witness and that his version
of events had too many contradictions. One of the minors had testified that De Villiers had asked
her to take off her clothes in front of him. He claimed she was only engaged in
method acting. De Villiers said he did not stop her from taking off her
clothes, as it was sensual and sexy, and he thought she wanted to do it. The court accepted the minor's testimony. De Villiers claimed the State witnesses had lied and
conspired with M-Net's Carte Blanche programme to harm his reputation and that
of his modelling agency. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
