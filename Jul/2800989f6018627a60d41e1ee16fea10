	     Harare - One person has died and at least two others have been
injured in eastern Zimbabwe after security guards opened fire on a group of
illegal miners, a report said. Around 200 villagers cut their way through a fence and tried
to invade the mine’s diamond sorting room armed with machetes and wrenches,
said the state-run Herald. Guards at the mine run by the Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond
Company (ZCDC) fired warning shots, but were forced to fire on the group when
it continued advancing, an unnamed source told the paper. 'Fierce attack' “Upon realising that they were now under fierce attack, the
eight security guards started firing towards the advancing illegal panners
(miners),” the source said. Three were injured in the raid that occurred in the early
hours of July 18, and one “bled profusely” and died on admission to hospital. A police spokesperson told the paper that they were still
investigating the case. 'Situation under control' ZCDC Chief Executive Moris Mpofu told the paper: “The case
is under investigation and our security guys are working with the police. There
is no security threat at the mine and the situation is under control.” Seven diamond mining firms were recently evicted from Chiadzwa
as ZCDC took over operations. Chiadzwa has been a hotbed since 2006, when
alluvial diamonds were first reported there. A police and army operation in
2008 cleared the area of illegal diamond diggers, and rights groups said up to
200 illegal miners were killed. ZCDC recently bought mining equipment from Belarus to start
excavating conglomerate diamond deposits in Chiadzwa after alluvial diamonds
ran out. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
