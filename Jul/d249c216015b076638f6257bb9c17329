The suspect is a well-known government official who still roams the streets without being arrested," it alleged."Secondly, the police are also dismissing the death of 46 year old Dumisai Madalane, whose body was found near the Acornhoek scrap yard, with some of his body parts missing. The suspects confessed to committing the murder on 16th of June and were arrested, but only to be released with claims that there is not enough evidence to keep them in jail."It referred to the suspected ritual killing of Nelson Maluleka, 36, who was murdered on June 20 and his blood apparently drained at the Phendulane crossing.Maluleka, according to the memorandum, was last seen with his friends at a tavern and was reported dead the following day.It also mentioned the attempted murders of 19-year-old twins who were apparently drugged and trafficked from Kronstaad.One ended up in Acornhoek and the other in Lagos, Nigeria."Our police are failing us... it is like [criminals] did their own research to find that it will be much easier here because the police are behaving like school principals sitting in their offices instead of being out in the streets saving lives," said the memorandum.It called for the station commander to intervene with immediate effect."We also expect to get response with immediate effect before the community takes law into their own hands," the memorandum said.It was received and signed by the Acornhoek police station commander Precious Mashele. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
