I am president so when you insult the president you get coverage and freedom of the press allows that," Lungu was quoted as saying.Lungu's remarks came as reports indicated that Zambia was slipping into a "dictatorship".Lungu was facing a chorus of criticism&nbsp;over his government's moves to clamp down on dissent. At the heart of the tensions was the arrest and continued detention of opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema, a wealthy businessman who has run for president five times, and narrowly lost out to Lungu last August.Authorities alleged that Hichilema blocked Lungu's motorcade with his own convoy of vehicles during a traditional ceremony in the country's western province in April. They said that Hichilema's motorcade did not yield after presidential security guards signalled for it to get out of the way. The opposition leader was &nbsp;recently&nbsp;charged with treason.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
