This is the beginning of the end of the new constitution."Majome said the ruling ZANU-PF party was "testing the waters" before planning to amend the constitution over other issues including presidential term limits and scrapping the bill of rights.Under the 2013 constitution, the president could only appoint a chief justice from a shortlist drawn up by the judiciary services commission and after public interviews of the candidates.Political tensions have been rising in Zimbabwe ahead of elections next year in which Mugabe, 93, is expected to win another term that could keep him in power until he is nearly 100."The ruling party does not see the constitution as a sacrosanct document," Harare-based political analyst Takura Zhangazha said."They will not hesitate to change what they are allowed to change using their majority in parliament."Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa hailed the adoption of the bill, which passed easily due to ZANU-PF's large majority in the 270-seat legislature."This is what democracy is all about, where those who do not agree are given an opportunity to debate but at the end of the day the majority will have their way," Mnangagwa said, according to local media.The country's constitution was adopted in a 2013 referendum after being drawn up by ruling and opposition parties under a power-sharing government.Mugabe would not be affected by the 10-year term limit, which does not apply retrospectively.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
