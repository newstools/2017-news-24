	     Polokwane - Angry community members burnt a man to death on Saturday after he and three other men robbed a liquor store at Ga-Mphusheng village near Lebowakgomo. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the suspects threatened and robbed the owners. "The nearby community members managed to grab one of the suspects at the back of the Bar Lounge and burnt him beyond recognition." On Sunday morning, police arrested the other three suspects in Soshanguve, Gauteng province. "Two of the arrested suspects are from Mamelodi and one is from Soshanguve and are aged 32, 34, and 36 respectively," said Mojapelo. Provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba commended the police for the swift action. However, Ledwaba warned communities to refrain from taking the law into their own hands as this was deemed an act of criminality. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
