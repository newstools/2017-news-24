But a few hours before the female residences post, there was an equally scathing post directed at men&rsquo;s residences, so I though it was fair," said the Stellies Rage adminstrator, who asked to remain anonymous.The post, published last Friday,&nbsp;listed the names of various female residences, accompanied by graphic descriptions of how to have sex with women staying there.Stellenbosch University spokesperson Martin Viljoen said: "Not only is the particular, anonymous post disgusting, it is utterly demeaning and disrespectful towards female students."Viljoen said that the post was an example of "rape culture", which includes "humiliating attitudes towards, and references to, women". He continued: "It is contrary to the values of our university and the culture of respect and human dignity that we would like to foster.&rdquo;Stellenbosch University is in no way affiliated with the page.The page was removed from Facebook after it allegedly breached its community standards. However, the administrator is uncertain which standard was breached. It is believed that the page was removed as a result of more than one complaint.The original purpose of the page was to create a platform where students could safely voice their opinions, according to the administrator. However, after receiving racist and sexist submissions, this goal was abandoned.The page was subsequently focussed on "humour and entertainment" for more than 26 000 people.University anonymous submission pages became a trend on Facebook in 2013. These include UCT Confessions, Pukke Confessions and Rhodes Confessions.A new Stellies Rage Facebook page has been created as an Adult Entertainment Service page.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
