	     CAIRO (AP) — A shadowy militant group in Egypt that is suspected of links to the banned Muslim Brotherhood has claimed responsibility for the killing of a police officer in a drive-by shooting in Cairo. The Interior Ministry said Captain  Ibrahim Azazi was gunned down on Friday while heading to a mosque. The attack happened in the Nile Delta province of Qalyoubiya, part of Greater Cairo. The Hasm militant group says in a statement posted on its official website that Azazi was a member of the National Security System, a tool for "oppression and tyranny." The group was responsible for several previous attacks, including last month's explosion in the Egyptian capital's upscale suburb of Maadi killing a police officer and wounding four others. It says "members of the security forces are legitimate targets." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
