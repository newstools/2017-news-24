The federation took the decision after affiliates booed and heckled Zuma at a Workers' Day rally in May."MKMVA values the tri-partite alliance, but we believe that it is critical for the SACP and Cosatu to return to the fundamentals that made the alliance such a great success and formidable force in our liberation struggle," wrote MKMVA national executive member and spokesperson Carl Niehaus.The association also pointed out that the governing party was the leader of the alliance and deserved to be respected as a "leading socio political force in society"."We sincerely hope that instead of proceeding along their current errant path, this 14th national congress will help the SACP to self-correct and re-affirm the required fundamentals of our revolutionary tri-partite alliance," continued Niehaus.The MKMVA wished the SACP well. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
