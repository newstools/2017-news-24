Venson-Moitoi also said in a parliamentary answer that "the principle of non-interference in the international affairs of other countries is at the core of China's foreign policy"."We therefore expect... China to respect our sovereign decision on this matter."The Tibetan leader, who lives in exile in India, is due to speak at the three-day "Mind and Life Dialogue" conference in Botswana's capital Gaborone on August 19.Venson-Moitoi expressed the hope that the visit would not "diminish the existing strong bonds" between the two countries.China is a key investor across Africa and the continent's largest trade partner and in Botswana it has helped build coal-fired power plants, road networks, bridges and schools.The Dalai Lama says he is seeking more autonomy for Tibet rather than outright independence.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
