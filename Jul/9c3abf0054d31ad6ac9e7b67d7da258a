The baby was still attached to her mother by her umbilical cord.&rdquo;According to Dollman, the mother and baby were carefully moved and loaded into the ambulance for privacy and then &ldquo;thoroughly assessed by the ambulance crew&rdquo;.&ldquo;Mom was more than a little surprised by the unexpected arrival of her third child who made an appearance several weeks earlier than anticipated.&rdquo;He said the baby was in good health.
