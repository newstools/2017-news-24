"The first three-year service level agreement was worth R4.5m and this time the city is increasing the allocation to R9m for the same period," the city said in a statement. The agreement would help the SPCA’s law enforcement department enforce by-laws by impounding stray animals or animals involved in attacks, in order to find new homes for them. "There is immense value in outsourcing animal welfare matters to those with the requisite experience, instead of trying to recreate that capacity within the city," mayoral committee member for safety and security, JP Smith, was quoted as saying. "With this new agreement, the City of Cape Town provides more funding for animal welfare than any other municipality in the country." During the 2016/17 financial year, the SPCA helped 9 279 stray animals, the city said. Cape of Good Hope SPCA CEO Allan Perrins said the agreement would allow them to focus on the prevention of cruelty to animals, instead of being preoccupied with raising sorely-needed operating funds. The city’s animal control unit dealt with hundreds of complaints every month, including domestic animal nuisances, roaming cattle, and livestock and dog attacks. 

In the first five months of 2017, it impounded 140 animals, responded to 90 animal attacks, and served 124 notices to comply with its Animal By-law. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
