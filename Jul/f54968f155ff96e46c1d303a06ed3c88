	     Centurion - He lay helplessly, battling to breath in a rubbish bin in Olievenhoutbosch, Centurion.  Netcare911 spokesperson Nick Dollman said on Sunday that a newborn baby boy was found in a rubbish bin by a passerby around 10:00 on Saturday.  Dollman said the little baby boy had been dumped some time during Friday evening.  He was still attached to the placenta.  Dollman said the man took the baby to a nearby church, where he was wrapped in a blanket and taken to the local police station.  Paramedics were called to the police station when the baby experienced difficulty breathing.  Dollman said he was attended to by an Advanced Life Support paramedic and treated for hypothermia. He was stabilised at the scene, before being transported by Netcare911 to hospital.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
