Sikulwazi Secondary is in Embalane, 10 kilometres from Muden and 30 km from Greytown. This school has neither water nor electricity, no toilets and in actual fact, no basic facilities whatsoever.   Pupils and staff have to go to the bush if they need the toilet. There are 68 Grade 8 and 9 pupils. Teachers have to take their desks outside the classrooms every morning and use the school yard as their office. This has been the situation since January. After leaving primary school and moving to high school there are vast distances – up to 20 kms – which pupils­ have to walk every day to get to school.   Sikulwazi was established to help bridge the gap of these long-distance pupils who were forced to walk far to continue their education.    They study under less than ideal conditions, in mobile classrooms, but without any basic services. Fortunately, for these youths eager to continue their education, the teachers are committed and passionate about teaching. Principal Mr Sithole confirmed that the Department of Education is aware of the situation, but no action has been taken to rectify it.    He said school personnel had approached Umvoti Mayor Thami Ngubane, but he had told them the municipality was unable to assist in departments which they are not accountable for.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
