He said of the several people that were injured, two remained in critical condition.&nbsp; On Sunday morning, some of those hospitalised had been discharged.

The SA National Civic Organisation (Sanco) urged for a review of security and evacuation plans at the stadium. &ldquo;One would have assumed that lessons were learned from the April 11, 2001, Ellis Park stampede that claimed 43 lives and the January 13, 1991 incident that claimed 42 lives at Oppenheimer Stadium in Orkney," said Sanco national spokesperson, Jabu Mahlangu, in a statement. &ldquo;It is tragic that what was a thriller between the two Soweto giants ended with loss of lives."
