It is alleged that the woman was pulled over on 14th Avenue, west of Johannesburg, and gang raped in the nearby bushes. IPID spokesperson Moses Dlamini said they were aware of the incident, but hadn’t received a full statement from the woman yet. "We haven’t interviewed the woman yet because she is too traumatised after the incident," Dlamini said. JMPD spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said they were investigating the matter. "If anyone should be stopped on the side of the road by individuals who appear to be bogus police officers, then they may drive to the nearest police station for help, or to a filling station where there are lights and cameras," Minnaar said. Minnaar said JMPD officers use unmarked cars for special operations and that normal patrol duties were done by officers wearing full metro police uniforms and in fully marked patrol vehicles. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
