Lethiwe Makhanya FORT Napier Hospital was brought to a standstill on Wednesday morning when security guards barricaded the entrance to the hospital with burning tyres.  The employees, under Ngiphile Security Services, say they want answers about their salary from their employee. They claim they work the same shifts, but get different salaries every month.  One employee, who spoke to Maritzburg Fever, but asked remain anonymous, said the protest started on Monday.  “We downed tools on Monday. Today, [Wednesday] there was action. We are not going back to work until our issues have been resolved. “This has been going on for years now and up till today, we don’t know why we get paid different amounts, yet we are doing the same job.  “We asked the employer to meet with us but he said he was busy. We are tired now. We don’t even know what our deductions are for because they are not on our pay slip.” The employees said their aim is to be heard by everyone involved with the hospital.  “Patients are going in and out as they please because the wards are unlocked. We want to be heard, especially by our employer, but he refused to come here when the hospital called him.  “He told them they must call the police to come and arrest us,” said other employee. When Maritzburg Fever visited the hospital security guards were sitting outside the gate, saying they not going to work. 
 Maritzburg Fever tried several times to get comment from the hospital but there was no reply by the time of going to print. Ngiphile’s manager Sifiso Mbanjwa promised to give a comment but when he was contacted his phone rang unanswered and he did not reply to messages.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
