	     Port Elizabeth - Three men believed to be part of an armed robbery gang, who posed as police, were arrested on the N2 outside Port Elizabeth on Wednesday, Eastern Cape police said.  A flying squad unit spotted a white VW Polo on the N2 outside Port Elizabeth driving towards Colchester around 07:30, Captain Andre Beetge said. The licence plates appeared to have been falsified and the three occupants began acting suspiciously when police started following them. “The driver of the VW Polo increased speed and a short chase ensued, until the police members forced the vehicle off the road just before Colchester.” When officers approached the vehicle, one of the occupants threw a firearm out of the window. All three were arrested and the firearm with five rounds was confiscated.  A police blue light, police uniform belt, handcuffs, two magazine pouches, police-issue pepper spray, two balaclavas and cable ties were found in the car. Police equipment may not be privately owned and was confiscated as stolen property, Beetge said.  The possibility that they were part of a so-called blue light gang involved in several robberies and hijackings in the Nelson Mandela Bay area recently would be investigated. The perpetrators had used police blue lights and posed as police officers to commit these crimes. The men would appear before the Motherwell Magistrate’s Court on Friday on initial charges of illegal possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition, and of stolen property. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
