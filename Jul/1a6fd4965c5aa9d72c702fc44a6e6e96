This may have caused the pup to be separate from his mother or his mother might have passed away," Abraham said.She said the organisations hope Edward will gain roughly six kilogrammes before he can be released back into the wild."His prognosis has really been incredible. We have stopped having to force feed him through a tube and he&rsquo;s eating &ndash; a lot &ndash; on his own."Edward thoroughly enjoys Orley Whip and liquidised sardines, Abraham said.&nbsp;"While he has gotten used to humans, we are sensitive to ensure he doesn&rsquo;t become too comfortable with humans as a source of food.""Edward Flipperhands", as he was dubbed by the SPCA, will be transported by boat to a location best suited to a successful release which will see him returned to the wild.The last time a seal of this kind washed out onto the Cape shoreline was in 2014 during a time of similar stormy weather, Abrahams said.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
