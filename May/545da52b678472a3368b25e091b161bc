We are now moving to Level 4 restrictions and we have set a daily overall collective usage target of 600 million litres.&rdquo;De Lille said residents were yet to meet the target.Also read:&nbsp;Cape Town water supplies will last until August - city official She said Level 4 water restrictions meant that, among others, all garden watering was prohibited and no topping up of swimming pools was allowed.&ldquo;This week, our dam level storage stands at 20,7%.
