We will keep using every parliamentary mechanism at our disposal to force her to act on the 'Jobs for Cash' report's findings."Motshekga established a ministerial task team in 2015 to investigate allegations that teaching posts were sold for cash. The task team's report was released a year ago. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
