It was her third attempt. The previous attempts had been scuppered by an earthquake in Nepal and an avalanche. Khumalo's spirits remained strong and was chatting in a Kathmandu hospital, where she is being treated, Sarieta Schultz, her spokesperson in SA, said. "It's not clear yet clear exactly how she was injured. The frostbite in her hands is much better and she is regaining feeling. Her feet are all right. However, she is being treated for an injury to her face. "She accepts that what happened is God's will, and will continue with her mountaineering trips to raise money for libraries for disadvantaged children," Schultz said.Another South African, Wilmien van der Merwe, 35, reached the summit early on Thursday morning. Her mom, Hettie, said the most dangerous part still lay ahead, when she has to cross an icefall on her way back to base camp.
