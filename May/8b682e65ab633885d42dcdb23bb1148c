"We have to wait for officials to investigate details from surveillance cameras in the area."Phramongkutklao is a military-run hospital that is also open to civilians. The blast radius from the explosion was 2-3 metres, police said.Since the 2014 coup, at least six explosions have occurred in Bangkok. Last Monday, a bomb went off in front of the country's National Theatre. Last month, a similar explosion took place in front of an old government lottery office.Most of the bombs in Bangkok caused only minor damage, except for a blast on August 17, 2015, that killed about 20 people near a popular Hindu shrine.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
