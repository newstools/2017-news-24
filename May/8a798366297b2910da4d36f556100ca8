They must stand up, I thought I would find a lot of men here, they are not here, they are nowhere to be found. We can't keep on talking about one in the same thing, we can't keep on being pushed to listen to people who do not have respect for women," she said.Dlamini is welcomed by members of the #ANCWL @News24 pic.twitter.com/z40hxQqocA&mdash; Nation Nyoka* (@Naewizzle) May 15, 2017Dlamini is welcomed by members of the #ANCWL @News24 pic.twitter.com/z40hxQqocADlamini said she would take the Minister of Police to task with regards to attitudes of police on cases of violence against women. She said that in the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting, it was said that there were loopholes in legislation that needed to be addressed.She explained that maximum sentences need to be increased, and that bail and reduced sentences should be denied for all violent crimes against women."Your sentence must be high and there must be no bail so that other men stop playing with our children, but also men must talk to young men about how they should conduct themselves," said Dlamini.&nbsp;Jabulile Ncala, ANCWL branch secretary of Vuyani Mabhaca in Ward 27 in Diepkloof said that charity needs to begin at home and that men need to support women."We are here to say the killing of children and women is enough. We are tired of our sisters dying in such a gruesome manner especially in the hands of those they trust. The law needs to take its course, the perpetrators of such evil must face the mighty hand of the law," she said.A white Toyota van branded 'Kupane funerals' was seen driving up and down the narrow street in Diepkloof&rsquo;s Zone 4, dropping off some relatives at the house.
