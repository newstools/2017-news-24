Last year he stood for election to parliament representing Istiqlal, a conservative nationalist party.His efforts to spark a debate on inheritance have won him plaudits from the liberal media and condemnation from his former peers."Thanks to 2M and Abou Hafs, a new step has been taken in Morocco: equality between men and women in matters of inheritance can now be raised in the public sphere," local site Medias 24 said.Weekly magazine TelQuel said he had begun "dismantling one by one the dogmas of radical Islam".But Abou Hafs has also received anonymous death threats on social media and been expelled from a national organisation for religious scholars.He has been denounced by the likes of Mohamed Fizazi and Hassan Kettani, preachers who were also jailed and later pardoned after the Casablanca attacks."He didn't just turn his coat inside out, he tore it up," Fizazi said.Kettani said inheritance rules were not just a "red line" but an "impassable wall".Islamic scholars argue that the Koran allocates women half the inheritance given to male heirs because men are responsible for protecting women and providing for them.Religious interpretation&nbsp;They say the rules were a major improvement on women's rights in pre-Islamic Arabia.But Abou Hafs argues that the issue is open to "ijtihad" - the process of interpretation by religious scholars."The issue of inheritance must be consistent with evolutions in society" in order to "protect" Islam, he told AFP.It is not the first time the subject has triggered controversy.In 2015 Morocco's official National Council of Human Rights (CNDH) called for women to be guaranteed the same inheritance rights as men, arguing that "unequal inheritance legislation" made women more vulnerable to poverty.Outraged conservatives rejected any debate on the issue and the ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD) slammed the organisation for its "irresponsible recommendation".But Nouzha Skalli, a former women's rights minister, said the lines are moving."Until recently, the question was taboo - you couldn't even debate the subject," she said."As soon as you said the word 'inheritance' you were accused of blasphemy. Today, the debate can be held openly.""The time has come to break the taboo, which hides major injustices against women," she said. "The Koran says that God is against injustice."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
