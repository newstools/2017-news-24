According to News Day, top
government officials said that Lestie, who was on a four-day state visit to Zimbabwe, wanted
to get advice from the nonagenarian on how his country could manage its polls. Lesotho was set to hold
its general elections on June 3. "This is one of those visits where Lesotho
wants to appreciate how best to end the turmoil that has characterised the
kingdom and has seen it being on the SADC agenda on countless times. The King
will take time to learn how to handle polls and seek help from his elder [Mugabe]," a senior government official was quoted as saying. Lesotho plunged into a political crisis after a failed coup attempt in
2014, prompting the then prime minister Tom Thabane of the All Basotho
Convention (ABC) to flee to South Africa, saying he feared for his life. 'Wise guidance and astute leadership' Thabane recently returned home
with two other opposition leaders, vowing to win back power. In March this year, the mountain kingdom again faced a fresh
crisis after parliament passed a vote of no confidence on Prime Minister
Pakalithi Mosisili. Zimbabwean state-owned media on Monday quoted Letsie as praising
Mugabe for his "wise guidance and astute leadership". "Your guidance and
leadership in bringing back normalcy, stability and legitimacy to the monarch
and other institutions will never be forgotten by our people… For all this, we
can only say thank you," the king was quoted as saying. Mugabe,
on the other hand, said that the visit by Letsie was a "clear
demonstration of the desire by Zimbabwe to maintain warm relations with
Lesotho", said a report by the state broadcaster, ZBC. The two countries shared a
history that dated back to the days of the liberation struggle in which Lesotho
played an important role towards Zimbabwe's independence, Mugabe said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
