During an ongoing cross examination in the Panayiotou trial, investigating officer Captain Kanna Swanepoel continually avoids directly answering questions asked by Christopher Panayiotou's defence counsel as contradicting statements are being brought up. Jump to bottom MS: You have dealt with the details of why the last four calls between Siyoni and Panayiotou were not recorded because he was away from the recording device in Shirly Street?KS: That is correctMS: I don't have any further issues to discuss with him[KS is excused]MS asks to clarify a few issues including the bail applicationDC says there is a box of documentation that was submittedTP: Can I ask what those two statements are that he wants to hand in, we have no problem in providing themTP: Apparently it has to do with the bail application, we have no objection to thatMS: In that case may we stand down till tomorrow?TP: I need to know if I am allowed to consult with Chanelle Coutts, Wilna van der Berg and Donovan VoslooDC: I haven't changed my mindTP: I just wanted to get clarity on thatDC: Court is adjournedMS: [Asks if he can begin his re-examination tomorrow]DC: Why?MS: I don't want to leave anything out, but I can begin nowMS: There was, at one stage, put to you that there was blood on the floor at Infinity, was any investigation done to determine if there was blood there?KS: NoMS: There is mention on a 081 number that called Siyoni on the 29th of AprilMS: Did you obtain a detailed call billing on that phone?KS: That is correctMS: I want to refer you to CRMS: Is this the detailed billing of this phone number? I know it is very smallKS: It is correct[Court is back in session]KS: [Refers to his diary, points out that on the day of the section 204 witness statement][KS points out that Siyoni was already booked out at 1pm]KS: Van der Spuy informed me that he was going to furnish me with a statementKS: Mr Van der Spuy was not present when I took down the statementKS: He told me he was going to make a statement and that I could proceed with taking it down, but that this would not be an official statement until the statement had been discussed in detail with his clientKS: I then took the statement down, as worded by Mr SiyoniKS: After I took it down, Mr van der Spuy came back to Organised Crime and he dealt with the statement, with SiyoniKS: The front page of the statement, the 19:00, is an indication of when Van der Spuy consulted with SiyoniTP: Aside from saying that 90% of what he just said is hearsay, I have nothing furtherTP: I am finished with my cross examination your honour, but I believe Mr Swanepoel wants to refer to something elseMS: He wants to refer to something in his diary, but I am battling to put my hands on it right now. Can I ask for a short adjournment?DC: Court is adjournedKS: Ngeza arrived with Trompie and then left again with TrompieTP: Our information is both Trompie and Siyoni don't know anything about Trompie being approached to commit the murder.KS: I can only say what Siyoni told meTP: What I am saying is that these two people were looking at each other in front of you and denied involvementKS: I can't say that is the case, but I do recall him denying his involvementTP: Lendell, Touch and Llama were approachedTP: But you never traced any of them?KS: NoTP: Touch was Siyoni's neighbour and you couldn't trace him?KS: We did speak to someoneTP: She alleges that you asked her if she used dagga and she said she had eaten a dagga cookie onceKS: I don't recallTP: Most important, to me, she says that she was asked if she was aware of Chris and Siyoni selling cocaine from InfinityKS: My answer remains the sameTP: That it is possible but you can't recall?KS: That is correctTP: And then you asked her about a man named Lendell?KS: It is possibleTP: Do you know of a man named Trompie?KS: I have heard of himTP: In the section 204 statement, Siyoni approached a certain Trompie to conduct the murder?KS: That is correctTP: And you took Mr Trompie to Siyoni to be identified?KS: I can't say that we took him to be pointed outTP: I want to put it on record, this is information we got from a family member of her's. I don't want it said in the newspapers that I consulted with herKS: I am not going to deny it, but I don't recall itTP: You and Koen asked her a bunch of questions, and if I read you the questions it will refresh your memoryTP: Apparently you was asked if she was pregnantKS: NoTP: Apparently you asked her if she ever used cocaine and she said noKS: I don't remember anything like thatTP: And you asked her if Christopher had used cocaine and she said noKS: I didn't have any evidence that they were using cocaine, so I wouldn't have asked her thatTP: It would be a lot easier if you just said yes or noTP: You have to discuss it, write it down and read it back to himKS: That is correctTP: So it is definitely something you could do in half an hour?KS: I don't think soTP: How long does it take to drive from organised crime to Kabega Park?TP: It is on record it's about 15 minutesKS: About 10 to 15TP: If we look at the front page of the statement, it was started at 7pm in the eveningKS: [Asks to see the original]KS: What I am trying to determine is when he consulted with Van der SpuyTP: The same day, the 3rd of May, is it correct that you and Koen called Chanelle Coutts?TP: You called her and told her to come down from the flat and she must not tell her mother that you had a meeting with herKS: I can't remember, if it is on record somewhere it is possibleTP: So the bruise on his ankle, although you say not visible, it was sustained during arrest?KS: that is what is written thereTP: Why didn't you ask him what happened to him during arrest?KS: Let us assume there was an assault for a minute, this section 204, I saw this as an exercise completely seperate from that arrestKS: That is why Advocate Van der Spuy was there to advise him on the making of a section 204 statementTP: But you don't know what he said?KS: Yes, but it was in related to the section 204TP: But you didn't hear it?KS: That is correct, as I was not allowed with himKS: But Advocate Van der Spuy was sent to our offices to explain section 204 to himTP: Siyoni testified in this court, I don't think we will ever see Van Der Spuy, but he said he was in big shit, that was allKS: I wouldn't know, I was not thereTP: How long did it take?KS: A few hoursTP: Next, statement 3 May 2015, 6 days after his arrest:TP: Have you made a statement of this nature before, if so, where; and he says no&nbsp;&nbsp; TP: Or did you mean in terms of section 204?KS: It states clearly of this natureTP: Here it asks, do you have any bruises or injuries and it notes, bruises on his ankles, wrist and red left eyeKS: I looked very hard, but there was no bruises, just a scratchTP: Why then did you then write it down?KS: He insisted it be written downTP: If you couldn't see it, you should have written no visible injuriesTP: The only thing you could confirm is the red left eyeTP: How were the injuries obtained, and he says during arrestKS: That is correct&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;TP: Did any of you explain the details of taking a 204 statement to Siyoni before you took it?KS: Definitely Van der Spuy would have explained it to him in detailTP: Did you hear Van der Spuy explain it to him that eveningKS: I was not present with that consultationTP: So you did not hear the explanation of the section 204?KS: NoTP: Siyoni disputed that he was warned, and now the only person who can testify that he was is Mr Van der SpuyKS: At the time of the consultation, that is correct TP: In the bail application, neither I or Mr Panayiotou had access to the docket, you could say what you wantedTP: You said you had a motive and evidenceTP: I am going to say that you were defeating the ends of justiceKS: I disagreeTP: This is the statement of Chanelle Coutts on the 29th of AprilTP: It has come to our attention, when she signed it, there were only two pages, now there are threeTP: Is that the case?KS: That would never have happenedKS: And even if it did, the third page has nothing to do with her, it refers to me, indicating that I took the statementTP: But she is supposed to sign every pageKS: Her statement ends on page 2KS: If you look at any of the statements takenKS: If you look at any statement that is incorporated into the docket, the person will never signed after I have commissionedTP: I will have to talk to her to confirm that, but I am not allowed to[TP continues to ask KS about evidence led in the bail application, specifically relating to Coutts and Kapp. He points out that he questioned whether Coutts and Kapp would testify about Panayiotou battling with his finances as a motive]KS: [Says they would be testifying about more]TP: I asked if those affidavits had been taken and Mr Stander stands up and says he has these affidavitsTP: Did he have them?KS: NoTP: So you saying this is totally false?TP: Let me help you, it is not in any of the affidavits that the applicant [Chris] was battling financiallyTP: Let us move onTP: [Reads from the bail transcript]&nbsp;The state will lead evidence that he was not in a position to get divorcedTP: Did you have any evidence at that stage that supported that statement, that was made under oath?KS: That was not under oathTP: Thank youTP: Here Mr Stander says the applicant's wife was spending too much money and he felt he was being forced to buy a house against his will &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; KS: Without Siyoni &nbsp;TP: Without SiyoniTP: So the state's case was that she was a woman of expensive taste, but testimony here has been the exact oppositeTP: There is nothing under oathKS: No TP: Those two points we can deal with quicklyTP: Let us start with TiervleiTP: If you believe that he is telling the truth, the state can call him, can't you?KS: YesTP: Let's see if you call himTP: In respect of the finance, you know he was given a loan of R2.5m?TP: Do you think the bank would give him a loan where he has to pay 25k a month if he was bankrupt?DC: Is this necessary?TP: He raised it my lord, but let's move onKS: I was asked to look at Tiervlei's statementKS: According to Tiervlei, Panayiotou's words were that something must vanish because he was in troubleKS: Again, there was no reference to JaydeKS: There were two issues that have been hanging in the airKS: There was the issue of the last four calls between Siyoni and Panayiotou not being recordedKS: Looking at the cell records, it shows that Siyoni was already on route to meet Panayiotou, and the recording device was not with, which is why these calls were not recordedKS: Then the last point, the financial position of Mr PanayiotouKS: Someone testified here that he had applied for a loan at Capitec Bank and it was turned downKS: His wife then had to apply for the loanKS: Over and above that, Jayde had to borrow R250k from her father to cover bond registration costsTP: The reference to the R40k, that Siyoni sent to Vumazonke, there is absolutely nothing there that suggests they are speaking about murderKS: Not in the message, but Siyoni did tell us what the message pertained toTP: With your permission I want to move onKS: SorryTP: Now he wants to say something else KS: On 1 April 2015, Siyoni says the following:KS: That R40k can be paidKS: Siyoni said he would add R30kKS: That is how we got to the R70kKS: Then on the 5th of April, sent message to VumazonkeKS: That is where he says he should come to PE to InfinityKS: That is the so called failed attempt, when the deceased don't come to InfinityKS: So Mr Price is correct in saying that there is no Facebook messages between these two [Siyoni and Panayiotou] that bares on the murderKS: But in light of that statement, we hoped that we would have found, in as far as Facebook messagesMS: Perhaps it should be clarified that this is in relation to BCTP: It appears that he wants to say something elseDC: But can we deal with the Facebook first[Court is back in session]Swanepoel is reminded he is under oathTP: Mr Swanepoel has a note with him and he has a chance to look at the documents so perhaps let us have him continue and then we can continueKS: I have reviewed the Facebook messages between Siyoni and PanayiotouKS: Mr Price is correct that there is nothing directly related to the murder in those messagesKS: There is a second handset belonging to SiyoniKS: This phone was wipedKS: There is a message, between Siyoni and Vumazonke TP: But that is what you and Stander placed before the court over and over againTP: I am going to prove it to youTP: Did you, up to this stage, bring up why it happened?KS: NoTP: Lets start at line 15: Mr Stander says "The state has a motive, and will prove the motive..."TP: Did you ever have a motive with regard to the financial position of the applicant?KS: He is technically bankruptTP: That is total nonsenseTP: Wilna van der Berg is your witness, the CA of the accused?KS:YesTP: Did she ever say the accused is bankrupt?KS: She never used that termTP: In fact, she said in her statement that his applicant's value was R3.3mKS: That is correctTP: Did you have anything that said the motive was related to finances?KS: Not under oathTP: It is now 1pm[TP asks for adjournment]DC: Court is adjourned for lunchKS is given opportunity to look at the various documentation he has asked to reviewTP: These accusations against you today, we also made in the bail applicationKS: I can't recall, but if Price states, it as a factTP: We told you specifically that we found it strange that you did not consult with the person who called Tiervlei and up until 2 mins ago you never indicated that he never wanted to give you the nameKS: The reality is, in theory there is a witness in jailKS: Firstly, this name was not given to me and in reality it will never be given to me because it is his friend who is still in prisonKS: We can debate this, no matter what direction we go, that name will not be givenTP: You took a negative statement from Tiervlei, because you never, once, wanted to take a positive statement for PanayiotouKS: That is not trueTP: Is it your testimony now that, during the first bail application, the motive for Jayde's murder was known to you and that you had it in sworn affidavits in the docket?TP: Do you have it in any sworn afidavit, excluding Siyoni, that CP wanted to get rid of Jayde because she was too expensive?KS: No I do not haveKS: I think Panayiotou made the offer and when he saw that he was not suitable, he realised he made a mistake and made the callKS: And it would have been clever for the news coming from the defenceKS: That is just my opinionTP: Lets test it, is there not a very important witness that could tell you want happened, that you did not even approach?KS: I dont know if Tiervlei wanted to give me the name of the man in prison, he didn't want to give itTP: Did you ask him for the name?KS: I did, he didn't want to give itTP: That's newsKS: You can think to yourselfTP: Do you agree that you would not have known about it if Mr Griebenow had not contacted you?KS: YesTP: You must be clear. A friend of his called him from prison saying that Chris wanted to see him. That is different from what you are saying?KS: That is correctTP: And you followed it up?KS YesTP: And you took an affidavit from him?KS: YesTP: Where he alleges Chris offered him money. Or that there was talk of money, R40k?KS: I speak under correction, but that sounds correctTP: Why would Chris tell his attorney that Tiervlei was there, if his intention was to bribe?KS: Am I being asked for my opinion?TP: Sure, you have given many in this court alreadyTP: You did. What does it mean that the applicant in fact sent people to his house?KS: That is what I am saying, that people related toTP: It is clear that you can't speak EnglishTP: Let us move on to TiervleiTP: Is it not correct that Mr Griebenow called you to say that Tiervlei was with Chris?KS: That is correctTP: And you took a statement where you say that Panayiotou, in fact, asked him to come?KS: That is correctTP: But is it not the case that a friend of his in jail asked him to come?KS: I will have to look at his statementTP: We will have to add that to the pile of documents you want to look atTP: Then you have lied again in your statement in the bail applicationTP: I am going to refer you to your own sworn affidavit, lines 9 to 12TP: Subsequent to these calls, the applicant [that is Mr Panayiotou] enquiring where Mr Siyoni can be foundKS: That is what Mr Siyoni told meTP: No, no, no. I asked you, twice, whether that is the case, and you said noKS: Siyoni said to me, people were sent to his house, but he could not proveTP: The applicant in fact sent ...that is what you said, you can jump around as much as you wantTP: You say there, and I will read...[TP reads from the statement]TP: Nowhere do you state that Chris was the person who sent the peopleKS: I never said Chris sent peopleTP: So it was people who were known to Panayiotou's or Vumazonke's?KS: Yes, people related to them in some wayTP: Do you have any specific information from Siyoni about who these people could be?KS: NoTP: Do you have any information about who sent these people to Babalwa's house?KS: NoKS: But I believed he was in dangerTP: The question is simpleTP: Did any name that came out to say that this person sent these people to Babalwa's house?KS: NoTP: Are you sure?KS: Siyoni said it was people from Panayiotou and Vumazonke, I can't take it further than thatTP: So you can't take it further that it was a specific person who sent them there to look for Siyoni?KS: That is correctKS: It is indeed so, but this court was shown that it gives signal every 8 secondsTP: We will see, when we go back to that informationTP: I want to go back to when you decided to detain SiyoniTP: The statement you made is the third statement you made from middle JuneTP: Calls up statement BF2, pages 5 to 8TP: "On a number of occasions, people related to accused 1 and accused 2, thats Panayiotou and Vumazonke, visited his girlfriendTP: Is that an accurate statementKS: That is how Siyoni told meTP: Did Siyoni say in any way that they were family?KS: This was already addressed. Perception was cleared up, It was not Panayiotou's fatherKS: She had a wound to her finger. There was also blood in the boot.TP: You say that you have all this information in affidavits, where are those affidavits?KS: The post mortum is an exhibitKS: The tracker, up to now, has not been shown to be faultyTP: Give us a chanceKS: And she was kidnapped. She would not have walked to the bushes where she was shotTP: I will continue, where do you have it under oath, factually. It is your inferencesKS: The car's tracker shows clearly what happenedTP: I am not going to argue with you about the trackerTP: The tracker doesn't show that the car stopped outside the gate of Stellen GlenTP: Let us go onKS: When you look at the Facebook messages, you can go through the statements tooTP: In general, when you look at pg 117TP: What happened outside the gate of Stellen Glen on the 21st of April? How she was grabbed outside the gate, pushed into the car and everything else that happened, where did you get that information?KS: I dont think Mr Price wants me to answer that questionTP: Did you write it down, under oathKS: If you go to the conversation between Panayiotou and Siyoni, it will come out thereTP: Are you saying that the deceased was placed in the boot comes from that conversation?TP: [Reads] Deceased was assaulted with blunt force to the head. Kidnapped from where she lived, Accused 3 placed in the boot of the vehicle.TP: Where did you get this information.KS: In the post mortum there is mention of the wound to her headKS: She was kidnapped from outside of the houseTP: And that she was in the bootTP: Line 17, agreed to pay R70k to have killed and R40k to shooterTP: Where did you get this, your case is R80k, not R70kKS: Siyoni said it went from R70k to R80kKS: I don't think R80k was paidTP: We not talking about payment. In the statement in Fort Beaufort, he refers to R80k, which he allegedly received from Panayiotou in FebruaryTP: And at that stage, the information was that R80k was supposed to be paid and R50k was to go to SiyoniKS: He never took that R80kCourt is back in sessionAccused have been brought back. Swanepoel is back in the dockTP: I am not going to go through your entire statement, as I would rather argue in courtTP: On page 114, again, there are a number of issues that you didn't haveTP: [Reads] "Applicant was under pressure, spending too much money"TP: Did that come from Siyoni?KS: That is correctTP: Not Kapp or Couts?KS: that is correctTP: When she testified in this court...[TP calls up statement by Kapp]TP: Let us look at this statementTP: What you say here is that Chanelle often raised her frustrations with the applicant, and you say that Kapp said that?TP: Show me in Kapps affidavit, where she mentions thisKS: [Reads] "Chanelle was clearly upset about the wedding"TP: That is not what I am looking for. Show me where she says that Chanelle raised her voiceKS: It is not here word for word, but it is my interpretationTP: Your interpretation has no baring hereKS: I beg to differMS: [Asks for a short adjournment]DC: Court is adjournedTP: "The mistress often raised her voice and expressed her frustrations"TP: Where did you get that?TP: Kapp?KS: That is correctTP: But you didn't have a sworn affidavit from Kapp?KS: No, but I want to give the reason for thatTP: I am not interested in the reasonsTP: You did not have a sworn affidavitKS: That is correct, but there were circumstancesKS: But what I can say is what was said in that statement and what is before this court does not differTP: That is also not trueKS: But, the real reason for the refusal of bail, and the facts of the case, were contained in statementsTP: Did you lie to Beeton, where you said, you had all this under oath, and you didn't?TP: Let me not say lie, let me say misledKS: No. That is not correct, what I had heard from Eksteen, was not under oath, and that had nothing to do with the strength of the case and why bail was refusedTP: So what you are saying is that, as long as it has no direct bearing, you can mislead the court?KS: I never misled the court. Until today I still have all that evidence at handKS: But before Mr Price says I am not answering his question, Eksteen's comments were not under oath at that stageTP: I am going to show that what you are saying is also not correctTP: You say that his mistress was often upset, where do you get that?KS: From KappTP: But you did not have a statement from her either?TP: You could not tell magistrate Beeton that you have affidavits to back up these statements if it is not the case?KS: It was important that this information was brought before the courtTP: I am going to bring you back to your own words: "Each of these comments are backed by sworn statements"KS: That is correctTP: Captain, Ms Beeton is sitting there and reading your statement. She must decide how strong is the case against Mr PanayiotouKS: That is trueTP: And testimony under oath is very reliable, but something said in passing has no valueKS: Mr Price is rightTP: Thank youTP: I want to move on to deal with certain pages from the bail applicationTP: We can make all the pages available and place them on record at some stage, but this deals with specific pagesTP: [Asks that the pages be placed on record as exhibit CU]DC: [Asks if this is relating to the first or second bail application]TP: First bail applicationGriebenow consults with clerk in relation to the documentation being placed on recordTP: [Refers to documents] Is it correct that you submitted a statement B1 in the first bail application?TP: On page 112, starting at line 5 you confirm that each allegation I refer to is supported by affidavits, and does not relate to any confession?KS: That is correctTP: You say that Panayiotou was involved in a sexual relationship with a female from the OK Grocer for the past 3 years?KS: That is correctTP: [Reads how Swanepoel states that the affair had come to the attention of the father of the accused and how the father had said he would disinherit him if he did not end the relationship]KS: I have already told the court where I got that information, from EksteenTP: But you have no statement from Eksteen at that stage, so you are lying to the court when you say the info is backed by sworn affidavits? TP: [Calls up exhibit B2]TP: It is exhibit B2TP: This is the cell register from Kabega Park, relating to when Siyoni was locked upTP: You will see there, under Siyoni, someone drew a stripe through the 28th and wrote 27th.KS: That is correctTP: The way it reads here is he was arrested on the 27th at 9pm, which is incorrectTP: The way you placed it in your statement is because you did not want to write something that contradicts the cell registerKS: I never consulted the cell register when I drafted my statementKS: The general impression was he had been arrested at Infinity, until such time as Mayi clarified he was not arrested there, he was only collected there and arrested laterTP: Did you have any Facebook message which specifically set out the planning of the murder?KS: From Mr Panayiotou, noTP: Well let me read what you said, because this is what is bothering meTP: "He deleted information that directly pertained to the planning of the murder". That is a blatant lie, up to today, you don't have thatTP: What messages between Panayiotou to Siyoni that pertains directly to the panning of the murder?KS: If I can go directly to the Facebook messages of SiyoniTP: Oh you want to look at it?TP: Can we proceed, I am almost finished with this witness, then he can look at them.TP: You say Siyoni was arrested in Kwanobuhle, but you say in your statement that Siyoni was arrested at the Infinity Cocktail BarKS: That is what Siyoni said, it was only after consulting with Mayi that it was determined that he was arrested in KwanobuhleTP: By the time you made this statement, you had already consulted with Mayi?KS: It is techincally correct, he was taken into custody at the bar, and arrested laterTP: I am not going to argue with you, but it is a blatant lie which was placed in front of a judge of this high court TP: And those messages, do they say anything about how the murder was planned and how it was to occur?KS: I would need to refer to the messages. I know there were messages for example between Siyoni and BabalwaTP: Dont divert. I am aware of it, but you say that Panayiotou deleted conversations between him and Siyoni. Do you know what was there?KS: Not word for wordTP: Can you tell us anything that was there?KS: I call tell you there were conversation between Siyoni and PanayiotouKS: There were also conversations between him and Coutts and KappTP: Please stick to what I am asking youKS: Other than what I have seen in Siyoni, I had informationTP: Stop jumping aroundTP: So how do you know he deleted his own messages?TP: This is the first time I have heard about itKS: There were no messages on Panayiotous phone that correlated with messages on Siyoni's FacebookTP: What did these messages relate to?KS: I believe it had to do with the deceased's licence plateTP: You must stop with inferences, do you know for a fact, what was said in those messages?KS: All I can say is that there were messages on Siyoni's FacebookTP: Which came from Panayiotou?KS: YesTP: This statement, in response to an application by Mr Panayiotou's application to see the docket, do you confirm that this is your statement?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; KS: I will have to read it to confirm it is mineTP: Can you recall that you made such a statement?KS: I didTP: You will accept that, a police officer, making a statement that is commissioned and is being placed before a judge, then it must not contain lies?KS: That is correctTP: And if it is stated as a fact, it must be a fact?KS: That is correctTP: I will take you to a paragraph, and I marked it. Since then Mr Panayiotou has deleted certain messages between him and other parties, including SiyoniKS: That is correctTP: And did you know what was there?KS: Siyoni's messages were still thereTP: And these are the messages already before the court?KS: I am not sureTP: But he could not delete Siyoni's messages?KS: That is correctTP: And did Siyoni know that you had Ngeza's permission?KS: He would not have signed if he was not okay with itTP: Again, you are not answering the questionTP: Siyoni says you placed the statement in front of him and told him to signDC: Was that not in relation to the other statementTP: I will have to checkTP: Let us continue[Court is back in session]Swanepoel is reminded he is under oathSwanepoel says before the cross examination continues, he would like to bring it to the courts attention:KS: The date of Mr siyonis release was witheld from me for some or other reasonKS: I went to check the occurence bookKS: He was indeed released on the 4th of OctoberKS: Mr Ngeza was aware Siyoni was being released on that dayKS: In fact Mr Ngeza told me that Siyoni didn't want to go home, and asked me to drop him in KwanobuhleKS: Ngeza even gave me a cell number that I could contact Siyoni onKS: What I am trying to say is Mgeza was quite aware of what was happening that dayTP: I am not going to argue with you on this. What you have said means absolutely nothingTP: Let me make this completely clear. Did you have Ngeza's permission to take the statement?KS: I didKS: Mr Ngeza's emails clearly says he is not going to be a state witnessTP: I have already said I will not ask you questions again, I move onTP: Did Ngeza give you permission?KS: I took the statement for indemnity, that's itKS: I would have invited him to be present. I was given the impression arrangements had been made with himTP: You are again not answeringTP: I understand that it is 11am.
