He allegedly volunteered to search for Arends. Her body was later found in the bushes of a sports complex in Tafelsig, Mitchells Plain.The roads outside the court were closed as roughly 200 members of the community protested against Tango.Community development activist Linda Jones said the court case showcased the lack of caring about violence on the Cape Flats."Everyday a girl is raped; every other day a police officer is shot - something needs to be done," she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
