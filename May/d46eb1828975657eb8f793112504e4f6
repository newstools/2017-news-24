Yet, white men, accused of serious crimes like murder and attempted murder are given cheap bail,&rdquo; he said.A large number of police officers were in the town.Earlier, a homeowner pulled his pistol at journalists who was trying to photograph his burning house.He shouted in Afrikaans: "Where is my pistol, where is my pistol?" while chasing journalists taking pictures of the house.He manhandled a photographer. A Netwerk24 photographer&rsquo;s camera lens was smashed while trying to separate the two.He also condemned the attack on journalists and has called on the police to arrest the man who was seen in video attacking the photographer.I'm told AfriForum is sending private security to #Coligny to protect racist white farmers, it looks like will have to reinforce our people 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
