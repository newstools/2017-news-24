Cape Town - The wounds Henri sustained the morning his parents and brother were murdered were superficial and typical of self-inflicted injuries, the Western Cape High Court heard last week.The only injuries he was unlikely to have caused were those on his head, back, and leg, clinical forensic specialist Dr Tiemensma testified.Dr Michelle Van Zyl testified that she saw Henri Van Breda at the Vergelegen Mediclinic twice on January 27, 2015. The first time was at 20:25, when he asked one of his stab wounds to be examined for possible stitches.Van Zyl said she had stapled the laceration, as it wasn't deep enough for stitches. The "clips" used for this simply brought the skin together, she explained.View the full extent of Henri's injuries below:(Graphic by Cobus Prinsloo, Graphics24)24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
