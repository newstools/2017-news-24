He looked through a gap in the toilet door where he saw someone attacking his brother, Rudi.Henri said his father had come into the room, Steyn recalled, and the suspect had attacked him.His mother and sister then ostensibly came in and also fell victim to the intruder, whom Henri then confronted and disarmed.He told the policeman that the man then stabbed him in his side with a knife and he had chased the intruder from the room and down the stairs.Henri also said he had thrown the axe at the man but had missed and hit the wall.
