He was supported by several Cabinet ministers.Those who want Zuma to go fear the party is losing credibility by the many scandals linked to the president.Zuma's supporters who have always dominated the NEC have argued the structure does not have constitutional powers to recall Zuma. They have also added that the power is vested in the branches which elected him to the position.Former president Thabo Mbeki was recalled by the ANC NEC as state president in 2008 after the KwaZulu-Natal High Court ruled he had interfered in the prosecution of Zuma on charges of corruption.The judgment was later overruled by the Supreme Court of Appeal.The ANC's alliance partners have previously supported the motion for Zuma's removal, citing that it would be dangerous for the ANC to keep him on as president ahead of the policy conference which takes place at the end of June.An NEC member told News24 it would be irresponsible for the party not to discuss Zuma's recall, while the SACP's deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila urged the party to deal with the matter or accept the demise of the 105 year old liberation movement.WATCH Joel Netshitenzhe talking on corruption:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
