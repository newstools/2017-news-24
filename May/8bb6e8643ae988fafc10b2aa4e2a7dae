They're opinionated, they're arrogant, and they're just plain and simple useless. I am happy for a white person to assist me, or a coloured person, or an Indian person."I do not want a black person to assist me," she shouts."Let me tell you something. This is the type of police force we have got. We got a low calibre [of] people working. If I see a black person, I will drive them over. If I have a gun, I will shoot everyone," she tells the officer before driving off.Momberg also appeared in the Equality Court earlier this year. The South African Human Rights Commission requested this court to fine her R150 000. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
