We don't have the means," said Qassem, calling for international relief groups to provide Libya with boats and equipment to save more migrant lives.In the first three months of 2017, more than 24 000 migrants arrived in Italy after making the perilous crossing from Libya, up from 18 000 in the first quarter of last year, according to the UN refugee agency UNHCR.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
