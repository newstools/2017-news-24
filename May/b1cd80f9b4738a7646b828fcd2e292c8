It is not known who they are or the circumstances under which the photograph was taken."It has to be cadets, because they don't have rank insignia on their uniforms," Redelinghuys said. "There also are no identifiable features in the background which can help determine where the photo was taken."Unless someone recognises the individuals on the photograph, it will be difficult to enforce accountability."Redelinghuys added, however, that the handling of firearms was extremely problematic, even among cadets and trainees, and that the police had to make sure that their training programme receives urgent attention. Newly-appointed Police Minister Fikile Mbalula's office was contacted for comment, but has not yet responded.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
