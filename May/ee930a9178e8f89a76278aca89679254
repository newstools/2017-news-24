The department&rsquo;s spokesperson, Sam Mkhwanazi, said the reason for this was that some of the patients&rsquo; files had been damaged by the fire that ravaged the new block of the hospital. The affected block houses several wards, including the paediatric, critical care, and the intensive care units. Management had put in place contingency plans to mitigate the impact of this on healthcare service delivery, he said. The hospital&rsquo;s orthopaedic and paediatric wards had been closed, Mkhwanazi revealed. "The casualty unit has been affected, and will only accept emergency patients for stabilisation, before they are referred to neighbouring healthcare facilities," he said."Hospital management is in discussions with neighbouring health facilities to assist with emergency operations," he said.Mkhwanazi also urged eye clinic patients to visit the Outpatient Department for rescheduling of their appointments."Elective eye operations will be done at Murchison Hospital and patients will be transported to this healthcare facility," he added.Mkhwanazi said the relatives of transferred patients should contact the hospital on 039 682 6678.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
