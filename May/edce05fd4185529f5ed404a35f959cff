The demand for additional funds is beyond the department's short-term capability.Certification backlog 'an injustice'He also said clearing the certification backlog at TVET colleges, some of which go back to November 2007, is progressing, and wants the issue completely handled by July."One certificate not issued is an injustice to the student who has paid and not written an exam."Graduates are increasing in most scarce skills areas, including engineering, teaching, and natural and physical sciences.Enrolments in universities increased by 15% since 2015. The figure however was down for TVET colleges over the past two years.Nzimande asked MPs to be seized with the perceived "gross underfunding" of the TVET college sector, which is needed for mid-level skills."How about toyi-toying as Parliament that this budget can't go through without providing more money for TVET colleges," he said jokingly.He closed by saying the department's priority was still to provide funding to marginalised and poorer students.His department would later present in-depth details on the annual performance, strategic and budget plans, ahead of Parliament's budget votes later this month.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
