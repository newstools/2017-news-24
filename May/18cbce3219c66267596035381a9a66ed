Freedom! National Dignity!" - a slogan from the 2011 uprising that brought down veteran dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and sparked the Arab Spring uprisings.Similar protests have rocked other parts of Tunisia, mainly in inland regions, with demonstrators often staging sit-ins to block access to key sites.Faced by growing social discontent, Essebsi on May 10 announced his decision to task the army with protecting vital installations.He said the army would put an end to roads being blocked, adding that "from now on the army will protect the sources" of Tunisia's production."I warn you from now" that dealing with the military will become "difficult", Essebsi said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
