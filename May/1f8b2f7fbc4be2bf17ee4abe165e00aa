The case is receiving priority attention. The disciplinary process should be allowed to run its course," Professor Wim De Villiers, Rector and Vice-Chancellor said.The Equality Unit reported that the posters and advertised event promoted racial polarisation and superiority combined with highly offensive references to Nazi propaganda and Neo-Nazism.It was in breach of the university's policy on unfair discrimination and harassment."It found that the behaviour and actions of the students in question had a demeaning and humiliating impact, and created an intimidating environment at SU."De Villiers said the venue booking was not approved by the university and they did not have any information about the planned gathering before the posters were displayed without permission."We will continue to take a stand against racism and unfair discrimination, and promote human rights, equality, human dignity and democracy. This we do in accordance with our own policies, as well as our commitment to the Constitution of South Africa and the Bill of Rights that it enshrines," he said.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
