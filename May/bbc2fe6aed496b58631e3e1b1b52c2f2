But more importantly, ANC branches that are not captured. ANC branches that cannot be bought, ANC branches that cannot be compromised.&rdquo;He said the country&rsquo;s first democratic elections in 1994 were not a victory over the enemy, but a breakthrough.&ldquo;It gave us an opportunity to build a foundation or a platform on which we will then be able to change or improve the lives of our people.&rdquo;He was pleased by the spirit of the zone and commended it for choosing to celebrate the life of OR Tambo, unlike other branches which observed ANC Fridays.He praised the zone&rsquo;s 11 branches for &ldquo;making the ANC alive&rdquo;.&ldquo;You can feel the pulse of the ANC in this area.&ldquo;Your branches are connected to the people of this area. Connected deeply in the homes of the people who live in the area. That is why you win your elections and that is why the ANC is known in the area, it is because of you. We applaud and honour you for the work that you do for the African National Congress,&rdquo; he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
