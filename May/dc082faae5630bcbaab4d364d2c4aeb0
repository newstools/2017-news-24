The court ruling this morning has proven my innocence. I was telling the truth and Mabuza was lying all along," read a statement from Phosa. "Truth is mighty and always prevails!!"Last week Phosa, former treasurer-general of the ANC, accepted a nomination for the ANC's presidency from ANC ward 52 in Cape Town.Asked if Friday's ruling would ease his road to the ANC presidency, Phosa replied: "My name has been cleared, let's leave the presidency out of this."Mabuza couldn't immediately be reached for comment.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
