There is a closet inside, imported from France,&nbsp;worth more than R600 000 - now gone. The paintings; irreplaceable."We are lucky that it is happening at this building, which was built between 1926 and 1927, and not the mansion. We&nbsp;prevented the fire from spreading there.

Thank goodness that it only burned at one place."Responding to a question about the security of the building, Cowie said he could not even think about it at this stage."Our biggest concern was everyone's safety and that the fire be extinguished."Other accommodation would be arranged for guests.A visitor said there had earlier been an explosion.The cause of the fire&nbsp;still&nbsp;has to be investigated.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
