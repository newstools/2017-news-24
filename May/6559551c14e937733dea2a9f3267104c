According to BBC, the decision was taken to ensure the safety of the children and teachers after some of the schools were submerged. Zanzibar's minister for education and vocational training, Riziki Pembe Juma, said that heavy rains had hit both islands of Unguja and Pemba in the past three weeks, leaving behind homes, properties and roads destroyed, reported The East African. "After going through the recommendations, we had no options rather than closing them [schools] until when the situation is normalised," Juma was quoted as saying.     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
