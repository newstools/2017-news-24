I'm only one person. I was alone," Oliver said in Afrikaans in a video clip shown in court.Prosecutor Lenro Badenhorst told News24 that a post-mortem did not support Oliver's argument as no semen was found in Bl&ouml;chliger's private parts.&nbsp;Oliver, 28, stands accused of murdering 16-year-old Bl&ouml;chlinger when he tried to rob her during a jog in the Tokai forest on March 7, 2016.In video clips shown in court, Oliver took investigative officers to the scene where he confessed to attacking her.He said he tried to steal her iPhone when he suffocated her.&nbsp;"I made double sure she was still breathing," he said repeatedly throughout the clips.&nbsp;Oliver said he tied her up in such a way that she could get loose.&nbsp;"She [Bl&ouml;chliger] can get back her cellphone, but she can't get her life back. I only took her phone," he said.The trial continues.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
