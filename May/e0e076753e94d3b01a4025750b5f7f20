"Wearing the T-shirt in the street is equivalent to publicly insulting all policemen", she said.The defendants have 10 days to appeal.In 2013, Tunisian rapper Weld El 15 was handed two years in jail for insulting policemen in a song calling them dogs.He appealed and was eventually acquitted after spending several weeks in jail.The case was seen as rolling back freedoms Tunisians had won in a 2011 uprising that toppled longtime president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
