Chester Makana, News24Polokwane &ndash; Parents of children at a high school near Polokwane have threatened to shut down schools in the Sekhukhune district unless the Limpopo education department builds more classrooms to end serious overcrowding.On Wednesday, they marched to the provincial education department&rsquo;s offices to demand more classrooms at the Mahwetse High School in Masemola village, south of Polokwane. They said they had been told that plans for the construction of additional blocks had been approved.They gave the department 14 days to respond to their demands, failing which they vowed to shut down schools in Sekhukhune.More than 800 pupils had been crammed into eight classrooms at the school for the past 10 years.Parents said education officials had ignored their pleas for additional classrooms.Community leader Louis Nchabeleng said the march was a final call to the department to deliver on its promises. Residents had built four out of the eight classrooms."Our children are now crammed into classrooms. There is not even space to walk. This is also traumatising our girls because they have to climb over desks," Nchabeleng said.Another parent, Leshabane Bapela, said department officials had become permanent guests at the school, but nothing was being built.Provincial education spokesperson Naledzani Rasila acknowledged that there was a shortage of school infrastructure in the province."We wish to build state-of-the-art schools in all villages. Unfortunately we can&rsquo;t build in all areas at the same time. We are controlled by the resources we have," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
