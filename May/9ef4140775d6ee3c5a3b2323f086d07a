They said it was a Nike tekkie turquoise in colour," Van Wyk said."I got a 'chilled' feeling that I was not looking for a little girl anymore, not looking for a little girl who is going to call back at me."READ: She can get her phone back, but not her life - Bl&ouml;chliger murder accused'Nightmares'Van Wyk said he went into the veld, roughly 10m from the sandy road when a woman walking her dog arrived.He told her what they were looking for after which she walked away."The way she screamed [when she saw the body] still gives me nightmares," Van Wyk said.Van Wyk called the response team to come and assist him before he went to the body."I felt for a pulse on the wrist and the neck. She was still warm," a teary Van Wyk said."I couldn't see her face, her face was covered with a rotten piece of wood."Van Wyk was testifying in the murder trial of Howard Oliver, 28, who is accused of murdering Bl&ouml;chliger when he tried to rob her.Oliver already confessed to stealing Bl&ouml;chlinger's iPhone when she jogged in the Tokia forest, but said she was still alive when he left her.In videos shown in court on Monday morning, Oliver showed investigative officers the scene where he attacked her.He said he suffocated her when he took her phone and ring.Oliver said he could not find the watch Bl&ouml;chliger had been wearing when he attacked her.Oliver said he tied Bl&ouml;chliger's legs in such a way to give him enough time to run away before she could free herself."I made double sure she was still breathing," he repeated several times in the video clips.Marc Jafta, a childhood friend of Oliver, testified that Oliver tried to sell the phone to him on the day of the murder.He said Oliver had a history of aggression."He [Oliver] can get really angry when he knows you are wrong," Jafta said."He beat me up a couple of times. We fought when we were younger, he is strong."The trial continues.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
