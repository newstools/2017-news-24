They had learned through the media that money was "siphoned off somewhere else," he said.Shivambu criticised Parliament's current secretary Gengezi Mgidlana, after media reports this year that he irregularly spent money on travel and a bursary."We could see from far that this guy is corrupt. He is not a proper candidate to become the secretary of Parliament. He is a law unto himself and does what he pleases."Mbete was protecting Mgidlana, enabling him to take "unauthorised international trips and give himself bursaries," Shivambu alleged.He blamed the non-partisan institutions that oversaw Parliament's money, saying they were not meeting regularly. He called on Mgidlana to step down.DA should 'look in the mirror'ANC MP Vincent Smith rebuffed Waters&rsquo; claims about Parliament being an employment agency for party headquarters.He cited a number of former DA MPs who were appointed to administrative legislature positions in Cape Town and elsewhere in the Western Cape after leaving Parliament."You don't criticise without looking in the mirror," Smith said.He criticised the DA for the way it allegedly treated its black MPs and Western Cape premier Helen Zille for her tweets about colonialism.Smith called the EFF's rejection of the budget "infantile" and said the party should instead do more to influence the budget.In her reply, Mbete thanked all members for the "robust" debate. She said she only had one communications manager."Maybe we can follow up with Honourable Waters to find out who these other four are. I don't know who they are," she said to laughter from the ANC caucus.She admitted they did not want a situation where staff got no increases."We have requested the management to find money. We have also instructed the secretary to Parliament to engage national Treasury, which he is doing."The matter about armed soldiers deployed to the State of the Nation Address is currently before the court. Mbete said Parliament was never asked to agree to their presence. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
