Hichilema's lawyers had asked the court to throw out the treason charges, saying they were baseless."The ruling will be made on Monday May 22," magistrate David Simusambasaid told the court after another judge earlier in the day acquitted Hichilema on a minor charge of using insulting language.As he was driven from court back to prison, Hichilema - leader of the United Party for National Development (UPND) - waved to hundreds of his chanting supporters.Suspects on treason charges are not eligible for bail in Zambia, and could in theory be sentenced to death.Hichilema, a wealthy self-made businessman, has been in custody since police raided his home on April 11.He made a fifth unsuccessful bid for the Zambian presidency at last year's election and has challenged the poll result in court after he narrowly lost to Lungu.The election campaign was marked by clashes between supporters of Lungu's Patriotic Front (PF) party and Hichilema's UPND.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
