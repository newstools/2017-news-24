This time around it is hoping to take seats from its rival, the Front of Socialist Forces (FFS) in the latter's heartland, the mountainous eastern region of Kabylie.The Workers' Party (PT) led by Louisa Hanoune, a Trotskyist member of parliament and former presidential candidate, is hoping to add to its 24 seats.A batch of smaller parties are unlikely to win a significant number of seats because of the nature of Algeria's list-based electoral system.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
