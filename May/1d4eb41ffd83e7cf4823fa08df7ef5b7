The reasons for the decision goes to the heart of what lead to the decision, essentially the key information which then informed his decision, not all the information.&rdquo;According to Selfe the president&rsquo;s legal team admitted in open court that the DA and the country were entitled to the reasons, if not the record.&ldquo;We have already been in touch with Judge Vally&rsquo;s registrar to request an urgent date to argue the application for leave to appeal. We hope as early as next week,&rdquo; he said.Zuma's lawyer Michael Hulley could not be reached for comment.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
