Beukman said the watchdog was established in terms of the Constitution to investigate alleged offences or misconduct by police officers.&nbsp;&ldquo;As such, any unlawful interference in the investigations of the IPID cannot be tolerated.&ldquo;It is essential that we are kept abreast of developments in this regard. We also need assurances from SAPS that there is no deliberate attempt to undermine the constitutional mandate of IPID,&rdquo; he said at the time.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
