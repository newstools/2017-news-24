Don't take us for fools," she said.The union demanded that the policy must remain but "be better monitored and maintained".READ: Dlodlo seeking long term for cash-strapped SABCInferior international productsSouth African artists should be allowed to tell their own stories in their own languages, she said."SABC should provide that platform.

What's funny is that the same interim board that wants to scrap the policy plays the same music that we produce during their weddings and funerals," he said.Ernest Moikangoa, from Friends Of Hlaudi revealed that from 1994 to 2015, more than R20bn in royalties was paid to international acts from America and Europe."Every year more than R500m leaves the shores of this country and only about R70m remains in South Africa," Moikangoa said.When Hlaudi said 90% is key, we knew that he had touched the wrong nerve, Moikangoa said."We knew that cultural imperialism is going to be in the forefront to make sure that the SABC under the leadership of Hlaudi gets dismantled," he said.
