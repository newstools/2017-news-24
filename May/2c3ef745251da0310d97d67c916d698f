One of the victims was also beheaded.A new date for voter registration will follow discussions with top officials in the two provinces, Nangaa added.Under a power-sharing deal reached on New Year's Eve, DR Congo is set to hold an election by the end of 2017.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
