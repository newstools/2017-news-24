It must also be noted that part of the figures in question are over a period of five years, and not a single year as it has been reported in the media," she said.She said the mayor was aware of current challenges within the local authority and had, therefore, been driving cost cutting measures since his deployment."Since his deployment to the municipality, the institution has obtained unqualified audit opinions, with less matters of emphasis from the Auditor General, and it also worth noting the three clean audits that the Sedibeng District Municipality attained during his term as the mayor.""In my deployment to Emfuleni Local Municipality, one of my key deliverables was to curb financial leaks and improve financial viability," Mofokeng said.The mayor reiterated that this was part of a sustained smear campaign emanating from the DA's dismal performance in the 2016 local government elections, "which saw the dreams of Chabalala, who was a DA mayoral candidate, fade away". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
