They were expected to appear in the Khayelitsha Magistrate's Court on Wednesday, but at the time of writing the outcome was not yet known.But Mngxunyeni said the community was so angry about what had happened that they wanted the suspects banished from the area.One is allegedly a tik dealer.The councillor left when things calmed down, but later on Tuesday, the three shacks were torched."The community did not even let them go in and fetch any personal things, they were so angry," Mngxunyeni said.Western Cape Social Development MEC Albert Fritz urged parents to be "extra vigilant" about their children on holidays and long weekends.He said the harming, abuse or murder of children had no place in SA.He called on the police to build a watertight case to get the people who killed Iyapha sent to jail, and for the community to help the police.Social workers were also sent by the department to support the family. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
