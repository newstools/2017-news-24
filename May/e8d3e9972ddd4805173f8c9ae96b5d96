Christopher Beaucher said he was checking on his mother's vacant cottage in Wilmot on May 1 when he saw something suspicious and went inside. He said when he switched on a light, the house exploded. "The whole place caught fire," Beaucher said. "Part of it collapsed while I was in it during the initial explosion, so I couldn't really tell where I was." Beaucher's face and hands were badly burned. He grabbed his cellphone but was unable to dial because of his injuries. He said he somehow asked his iPhone's voice-controlled virtual assistant Siri to call 911, believing he was going into shock. Beaucher is undergoing treatment for his injuries, but says he hopes to return to his job as a cook and tend to his farm. "I'm very, very, extremely lucky to be alive," he said. The New Hampshire state fire marshal's office is investigating the explosion. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
