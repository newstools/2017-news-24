The track record of our economic strategy speaks for itself."Mpofu said the unfavourable exchange rate inflated costs in the premier's engagements in two countries over eight days, but that this would not deter her from doing the job.He also said Wesgro facilitated "direct business engagements" as a result of the trip, and was a "world class agency" that had already secured almost R6bn worth of investment for the province this term.Zille on Sunday said she would welcome an investigation by the Auditor General."Absolutely. He must investigate it. I have no problem with that. He does it in any case and I welcome it," she told Netwerk24 on Sunday after the ANC's statement.Zille's tweets about the trip, especially about Singapore, have left her political career in the balance.She said Singapore's legacy of colonialism was not all negative."For those claiming legacy of colonialism was only negative, think of our independent judiciary, transport infrastructure, piped water etc," she wrote.She is facing four charges of having brought the Democratic Alliance into disrepute and damaging the party's interests.She later apologised for her comments, saying she never intended to defend colonialism. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
