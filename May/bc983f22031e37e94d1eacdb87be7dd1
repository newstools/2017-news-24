Control of resources in the area - which is rich in diamonds, gold, coffee and cattle trading - may have played a role in fighting, she added.Hundreds of reinforcements were sent to Bangassou to restore calm, and Corner said the situation remained "extremely fragile."The United Nations has 10 000 troops and 2 000 people serving in its MINUSCA force in Central African Republic, which descended into bloody sectarian fighting after the 2013 overthrow of leader Francois Bozize.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
