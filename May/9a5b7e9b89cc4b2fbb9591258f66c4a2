Marshalls tried to calm the situation, as leaders who are separated from the crowd by a fence looked on. Police also lined up the barricade. The scuffle broke out after President Jacob Zuma arrived at Cosatu's main Worker's Day rally at Loch Logan Park in Bloemfontein. Earlier, the crowd booed Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini when he was introduced.&nbsp; They also put their hands in the air doing the soccer change signal. The crowd also chanted that Zuma must go, and sang a song which, when loosely translated, said "Have you heard the good news, Zuma is going". Earlier Cosatu in the Free State said it was concerned that there were people wearing T-shirts that did not have an emblem of any of their affiliates.ANC President Cde Jacob Zuma has arrived for the #WorkersDay rally in Bloemfontein, Free State #MayDay2017 pic.twitter.com/g26jpzkvCh#MayDay2017: Cronin: &quot;Phansi with the nuclear deal, phansi.

Scuffles here and there @News24From News24's Amanda Khoza in Sandton: The national anthem came to an abrupt end when Cosatu members refused to sing the Afrikaans part of the anthem on national workers day on Monday. When the woman that was leading the anthem came to Uit die blou van onse hemel, the crowd shouted, hayi, hayi! No, no! and the anthem came to an abrupt end. Thousands of Cosatu members marched to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange building, led by ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe, South African Communist Party deputy secretary Jeremy Cronin and Cosatu general secretary, Bheki Ntshalintshali. Hundreds of people marched from to the George Lea Park to the JSE building in Sandton calling for the white monopoly capital to fall and for the country s wealth to be shared with the poor. The leadership is expected to handover a memorandum to an official from the JSE.News24's Tshidi Madia tweeting from Bloemfontein that different leaders on stage trying to speak to the workers, but they are not having it.
