Did you open a docket?" Nortje asked Knipe.Broken the lawKnipe said he did not, but neither had others, who had known about the claims, including Lincoln.Asked about the claim that the presidential investigative unit had been set up to protect Palazzolo, Knipe said he believed Lincoln and Palazzolo had been friends."I believe [Lincoln] had ulterior motives," Knipe said.Nortje said if Smith had indeed leaked documents from the investigative unit to other countries, he would have broken the law.Knipe admitted it would have "been wrong".Previously in the trial, Lincoln had testified about relationships Palazzolo apparently had with officials."It was alleged he had on his payroll the head of organised crime, the [former arts and culture] minister Pallo Jordan and [then organised crime head and assistant commissioner] Neels Venter," he had said.On Wednesday Knipe testified that he had previously called Lincoln's probes "a real disaster" because nothing had come of his investigations.Nortje put it to him that it was because Lincoln was arrested and could not carry on with investigations and finalise his mandate as a result."I don't agree&hellip; There was no evidence against any of those people," Knipe said."[There were] enough competent people to take it over."The trial is expected to continue on Thursday when another witness is set to be called. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
