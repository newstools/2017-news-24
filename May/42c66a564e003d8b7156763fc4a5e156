The conflict in the area of Lake Chad has left 20,000 people dead since then.Funding gap hits children"We've seen hundreds of thousands of people displaced from border areas in Niger, Chad and Cameroon, and millions from Nigeria. The epicentre may be northeastern Nigeria but it's become a very big regional challenge," Brown said.The World Food Programme said it needed $230 million between now and October to stave off a famine in Nigeria.Brown admitted the Rome-based food agency had not been prepared for a crisis on this scale there."It's a middle-income country, it's the richest country in Africa. We didn't think we'd have to apply our emergency capabilities here"."The first time we went up there was a year ago. We were not prepared for the level of human suffering that we saw," she said.It was local communities, "some of the poorest people on the planet", that worked as "first responders" when the crisis hit.The agency's famine-prevention programme targets as standard all children from six to 23 months, making sure they are screened with the help of Unicef and given special food.But in Nigeria it was not just babies and toddlers at risk."When we saw the level of malnutrition in older children, we expanded that to all children under five-years old, but because of the lack of resources we've had to scale it back again," she said.The cut to food aid also comes as the country hits the "lean season", a period of the year when families naturally have less to eat.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
