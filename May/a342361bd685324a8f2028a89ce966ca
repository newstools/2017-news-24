As a nation we must say where were we yesterday, where are we today with regard to everything and what must we do," he said.WATCH:There was consensus on the economy of the country being one of the key topics which South Africans needed to debate.Mbeki said the Constitution of the country also needed to take centre stage, explaining that it was the people who decided that South Africa should be a constitutional democracy."It means that anybody or [any] institution which acts in violation of any provisions of the Constitution is repudiating the will of the people," Mbeki said.Motlanthe, the third former president to speak, cautioned against leaders who became averse to criticism and saw themselves exempted from the norms and standards they opposed onto others in a society."Such aberrations as taking authority as truth only happens when the country's citizens withdraw to themselves without caring to listen to the harm of daily politics," said Motlanthe.The consequences of having none [national dialogue] are too ghastly to contemplate in a post-apartheid, post-colonial setting, he added.DisruptionMembers of the Economic Freedom Fighters attempted to disrupt the event, with some arriving just before lunch time. They said they were opposed to De Klerk's involvement in the dialogue.Earlier, party leader Julius Malema hit out at Motlanthe and Mbeki for including the apartheid era president in the initiative.Malema, who was appearing in the New Castle Magistrate's court said the two should not share a stage with an "apartheid criminal"."By recognising De Klerk, Mbeki and Motlanthe made a mistake that will lead to white racists thinking they still have a place in SA," he said.The initiative, two years in the making, was announced in 2016 and is now expected to go to provinces where the NFDI seeks to engage with South Africans about challenges facing the country.#NationalDialogue the EFF earlier... initially took issue with De Klerk's involvement in the project @News24 pic.twitter.com/5pYAad1kPp24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
