It's an attempt to enter by force and it requires a reaction," ministry spokesman Belhassen Oueslati told Express FM radio on Monday.The ministry statement also said pumping at El Kamour had resumed "normally", after public radio on Saturday said protests had caused the installation to shut down."Following tensions... and to avoid any loss of human life, military units called on a specialised engineer to temporarily decrease pressure at the pumping station, then brought it back... to normal levels" on Sunday, the statement said.Prime Minister Youssef Chahed's unity government is facing an increasing wave of social unrest, especially in the North African country's interior. Protesters often stage sit-ins to block roads and access to key sites.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
