"Political aims must not be pursued through violence. Civilians must be protected."Witnesses said tanks had been deployed in the fighting.&nbsp;'Nothing stops them'&nbsp;British ambassador Peter Millett tweeted that he could hear explosions and artillery in south Tripoli. He condemned "action by these militias who threaten security" ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins on Saturday in Libya.Groups hostile to the GNA said they had attacked loyalist forces.By late afternoon the fighting had subsided, but intermittent gunfire could still be heard in several areas of the capital.The fighting started around a complex of luxury villas that until March had served as the headquarters of militias loyal to former prime minister Khalifa Ghweil.Ghweil was ousted from power when the GNA took office in March 2016, and has refused to recognise the new administration.Loyalist forces seized the villas in four days of intense fighting in March that saw them expand their control over the capital.Tripoli had been relatively calm since, but dozens of armed groups still operate there - including several that support Ghweil.The GNA has won the support of various militias since it took office in March last year, but several parts of Tripoli remain beyond its control.Relying on militia support and pitted against a rival administration in the east, the GNA has struggled to assert its authority.In a statement on Friday, the GNA blamed Ghweil and Salah Badi, both leaders of the Fajr Libya coalition of militias which took power in Tripoli in 2014, and vowed to "retaliate mercilessly".They "have exceeded all limits... Nothing stops them, not faith, not law, not custom and not morals," it said."This is their gift to the people for the month of Ramadan", the statement said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
