No arrests have been made.The case comes five months after laptops were stolen on December 12, and eight tyres went missing from the station a month prior.IFP KwaZulu-Natal provincial spokesperson on Community Safety and Liaison, Blessed Gwala demanded a thorough investigation into the missing firearms, suspecting an &ldquo;inside job as there was no break in&rdquo;.The head of the station should be held accountable, he insisted.&ldquo;It must be ascertained whether there are other staff members who have access to the room or safe where the firearms are stored and if there are spare keys. This issue deserves urgent attention and the culprits must be brought to book because it is obvious that someone is in cahoots with criminals,&rdquo; Gwala said.&ldquo;The more firearms that are in a single place, particularly handguns, the more of a target that place will become. We are of the view that stolen firearms are being modified and they represented the bulk of illegal firearms that are in the hands of criminals.&rdquo;&nbsp;He further called for a full audit of firearms allocated to police stations across the province, as well as those kept as exhibits in criminal cases. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
