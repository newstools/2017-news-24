She, however, said she was not in principle opposed to a secret ballot.In her affidavit, she asks the court to make a finding on the constitutionality of the parliamentary rules so that they can be redrafted, if necessary.In contrast, the UDM argues that since the president is elected by secret ballot, a vote of no confidence should be conducted in a similar manner.The Constitution does not determine a voting procedure in this regard.The vote of no confidence had been scheduled for April 18, but was postponed at opposition parties' request, pending the court's ruling on the matter.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
