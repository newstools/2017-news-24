Anybody."Advocate Johann Nortje, who is representing Lincoln, told Bouwer he was not intent on attacking him or the justice department.He apologised if it came across that he had attacked Bouwer's integrity.'Strong' drunk driving caseLincoln had previously faced a charge of driving under the influence and another of leaving an accident scene after the car he was driving ploughed into two other cars on the opposite side of a street.This happened during June about two decades ago.On Thursday, Bouwer said he was shocked Lincoln had been acquitted of the charges."I couldn&rsquo;t believe it."He said he had dealt with hundreds of drunk driving cases."This is probably one of the strongest I ever had," Bouwer said, referring to the Lincoln crash.He said "gang boss" Cyril Beeka, who was murdered in 2011, and his henchman had been first on the scene.Instead of taking Lincoln to hospital, Bouwer said, they had taken him to a Spur restaurant for breakfast."Does it not offend you that this man was acquitted?" he asked emphatically."It offends me deeply."Nortje said the emphatic manner in which Bouwer was testifying showed his "overzealousness" to prosecute Lincoln.Bouwer responded that he was passionate about justice.The case continues on Monday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
