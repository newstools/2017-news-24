Critics call him an authoritarian ruler who does not tolerate opposition.Four candidates so far have announced their plans to challenge Kagame, who is expected to win. During the last election in 2010, he won 93% of the votes.Kagame has been Rwanda's de facto leader or president since 1994, when his rebel movement ended a genocide perpetrated by Hutu extremists in which an estimated 800 000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed.He is widely praised for bringing stability and economic growth to Rwanda, though he frequently faces criticism for rights abuses against civilians.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
