I was taught to resent the flatness of my nose and the way that I was always darker than my friends,&rdquo; she said.The black doll was never the "pretty" doll.&ldquo;I was taught that everything about my being was wrong, that if I didn't speak English in a certain way or if my hair wasn't long and flowing it was something to be ashamed of,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;That the fact that all of a sudden I had hips when all of my peers were shaped like ironing boards meant that there was something wrong with me. Everything about me that wasn't &lsquo;white&rsquo; was wrong.&ldquo;So no, I don't hate white people but I do hate how they, people external to my own being, have shaped my own journey of self-love,&rdquo; she wrote.In August 2011, her grandfather said the damage caused by apartheid was impossible to escape and called for white South Africans to pay a &ldquo;wealth tax&rdquo;. &nbsp; The Desmond and Leah Tutu Foundation&rsquo;s Benny Gool referred queries to Burris.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
