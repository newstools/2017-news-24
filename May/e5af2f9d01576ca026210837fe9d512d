The teenage girl said that she was abducted in 2013, together with her father, Usman in Gwoza, Borno state when they were trying to flee to the Mandara mountain fearing a looming attack on their village. &nbsp;She said that after she refused to marry the Boko Haram fighters, she was taken to a herbalist where she was made to drink an unknown concoction and was later transported to the military base alongside other attackers.&nbsp;One of them detonated her bomb-laden vest but only killed herself, the other was shot dead by the military. " &hellip;At that time something told me to remove my own IED and surrender which I did. &nbsp;I was surrounded by soldiers and policemen and I fainted."When I woke, I discovered that one of the policemen at the checkpoint was a brother of my mother's. I think that was the reason I survived," the unnamed teenage girl was quoted as saying.&nbsp;Reports last month indicated that radical Boko Haram fighters were increasingly forcing children to carry out bombings, with the number of attacks since January already nearly reaching the total for all of last year.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
