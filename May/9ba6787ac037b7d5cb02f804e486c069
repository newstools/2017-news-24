Proceedings are now underway. @News24Petition for release of Coligny murder suspects&nbsp;irks SANCOAccording to a media statement released by the South African National Civic Organisation (SANCO) on Wednesday, the organisation slammed the petition by white Coligny residents calling for the release of two farmers accused of killing 17-year-old Matlhomola Jonas Mosweu as racism in action."It is shocking that some of our compatriots in typical Ku Klux Klan fashion choose to demonstrate solidarity with alleged perpetrators of one of the worst atrocities in our farming communities," highlighted SANCO National Spokesperson, Jabu Mahlangu.According to Mahlangu, the petition which nails to the mast disdain for the rule of law and unmasked racism undermines reconciliation, nation-building and social cohesion."We are confident that the cause of justice will not be deterred by unprecedented lunacy and barbarism as any action to the contrary will send a wrong message to society pertaining our constitutional values and upholding the culture of human rights," he added. He appealed for calm and restraint adding that granting bail to Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutte will infuriate the section of the community that feels that the two must remain behind bars until cause of justice has run its course.#Coligny A group of protesters outside magistrate&#39;s court @News24 pic.twitter.com/quLnXnR7FW#Coligny Court adjourns for few minutes @News24#Coligny Defence says at this stage there are no findings re postmortem, Kgorane agrees @News24#Coligny State says they fail to understand if the defence wants to proceed without the postmortem or postpone the matter @News24#Coligny Defence says they have been in the dark for quite a while and there is only a single witness @News24#Coligny Defence says Kgorane told the court that he was present when postmortem was conducted and he should know the outcomes @News24#Coligny Defence says if the State thinks they have a strong case then they want to test it. @News24#Coligny Magistrate Foso tells the defence that maybe they brought the urgent bail application prematurely @News24#Coligny magistrate: we can adjourn until tomorrow - you won&#39;t have the postmoterm or the photo album today. @News24#Coligny Defence says there is no reason why a postmortem could not be made available in court today, magistrate says no @News24#Coligny Magistrate asks if defence wants Kgorane to give the opinion of the doctor, defence says &quot;no, his conclusion&quot; @News24#Coligny Kgorane tells the court that a pathologist might be in a better position to explain the postmortem @News24#Coligny Defence asks if Kgorane has received an outcome in respect of the 1st postmoterm - Kgorane says he hasn&#39;t @News24#Coligny Mag asks State if they intend calling doctors in order for them to explain the postmoderm - State says they don&#39;t know yet @News24#Coligny Kgorane says the second postmoterm was just to examine the body to find out more on how the young Coligny boy was injured @News24#Coligny magistrate Foso is seeking for more clarity, he is asking how the first and second postmoterm are conducted @News24#Coligny Kgorane is trying to explain how the postmoderm was conducted but magistrate Foso asks for clarity @News24#Coligny Kgorane says he didn&#39;t see the witness making a statement on TV but he heard from other people @News24#Coligny Defence tells Kgorane that his witness also made statement on national TV on April 27 - He says correct @News24#Coligny Defence asks why the officer who took the statements didn&#39;t think of registering a murder docket @News24#Coligny Kgorane says the witness statement was taken on April 23 @News24#Coligny Kgorane says the case was opened after the accused told the police that the boy jumped from a moving vehicle @News24#Coligny A group of people can be heard singing outside the magistrates court @News24 Jump to top
