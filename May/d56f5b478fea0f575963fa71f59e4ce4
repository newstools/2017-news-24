"We cannot continue that way. We are wasting money and time if we don't stop the war."Da Silva said the UN agency is trying to provide food, seeds and livestock simultaneously to farmers to take advantage of the rainy season."This is the time for farmers to plant. They don't have seeds. They have eaten the seeds. Even the seeds that the FAO provided last month, they have eaten them," he said, during a visit to Brussels to drum up support at EU headquarters.Da Silva warned that if South Sudan farmers "lose their cattle, their goats ... they will move out, they will become migrants."More than 1.8 million people who fled their homes have left South Sudan altogether, sparking what has become the world's fastest-growing refugee crisis.Food insecurity in South Sudan, which declared independence in 2011, reached record levels last year, hitting 67% of the population. Cereal production was at its lowest level since the conflict started.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
