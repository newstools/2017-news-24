So you should ask him."He said it was worrisome for him if IPID was not going to be IPID, but something else."I want IPID to expose rogue behaviour, and bring it to book. I want them to be fully funded so they have got the capacity."If they do not have capacity, they will fall into the hands of people with agendas. But I don't discuss national security with journalists, I talk about it in my cocoon."New permanent police commissionerHe said the department will embark on the process of finding a new permanent police commissioner in the coming months, as suspended police commissioner Riah Phiyega's term comes to an end in June."Before the end of the year, we will have another sheriff in town."Mbalula also touched on his ministry's upcoming budget, R87bn, and what plans he has for his department going forward.Various policies have been revised on his instruction, including the functioning of the detective services, the management of serial rape and murder, an anti-gang strategy, a "use of force" policy, and removing barriers to reporting on sexual offences and violent crimes."Here in South Africa, there is no thug or gangster that can stop us from searching them."It threatens our national security if some of our police force members are accused of being in the pockets of the gangsters."He also reaffirmed that the white paper on establishing a single, unified police service was in consultation phase. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
