The protesters shouted slogans including "We are all Zefzafi" and "End militarisation", with hundreds of them brandishing photographs of the detained leader.Anti-riot police attempted to disperse the protest, but pulled back following a tense but non-violent standoff with the demonstrators.A similar demonstration took place in the neighbouring town of Imzouren, with a strong police presence, images on social media showed.Smaller protests were held in the capital Rabat and the commercial capital Casablanca but were broken up by police, Moroccan media reported.Zefzafi's arrest was ordered after he allegedly interrupted a preacher at a mosque on Friday and called for further demonstrations.Prosecutors charged that he had "obstructed, in the company of a group of individuals, freedom of worship" at the mosque in Al-Hoceima.He was arrested on Monday "along with other individuals" and transferred to Casablanca, prosecutors said.As of Monday evening police had arrested 40 people in connection with the disturbances in Al-Hoceima, according to officials.Human rights groups gave higher figures.The mainly ethnically Berber Rif region has long had a tense relationship with Morocco's central authorities, and was at the heart of Arab Spring-inspired protests in 2011.The protests subsided following a series of political reforms including constitutional changes that saw King Mohamed VI give up some of his wide-ranging powers.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
