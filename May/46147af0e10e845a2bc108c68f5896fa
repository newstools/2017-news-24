If there were, they wouldn't have been killed," said Makary, adding that his nephew had become a father for a third time just two months earlier.'Always the same'&nbsp;Samuel Chalabi, 49, lost his older brother Ishak in the attack. "As long as security forces don't do their work properly, this will continue until all of us are eliminated," he said."It is always the same - we will be a little bit sad, they will pity us, but it will start again," he added, saying he feared further attacks on his minority community.Mourners passed around cellphones to share video footage of bloodied bodies lying on the ground, some with their heads smashed."There is no security for Christians," said Hakim Hana, a 25-year-old carpenter mourning his cousin.On April 11, bombers attacked two churches north of Cairo on Palm Sunday, killing 45 in the deadliest strike in living memory against the Copts.The bombings prompted Sisi to declare a three-month state of emergency.On Friday, state televisions aid Egypt's air force launched six air strikes against "terror camps in Libya" in retaliation for the attack on Coptic pilgrims.It came after Sisi vowed in a televised speech that "Egypt will not hesitate in striking terror camps anywhere, either inside (the country) or outside it".When the funeral service ended, the coffins were brought out of the small church of Deir El Jernous and carried in procession down a dusty street.Women sobbed as the crowd tried to touch the coffins for one last time as church bells rang out into the night.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
