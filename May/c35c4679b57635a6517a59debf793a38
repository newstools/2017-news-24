The driver had no public driver&rsquo;s licence. &nbsp; &ldquo;We fined the driver, impounded the taxi and arranged alternative transport for the children,&rdquo; Mnisi said. &nbsp; Ntshalintshali warned parents to check taxis that took their children to school. &nbsp; &ldquo;It is every parent&rsquo;s responsibility to make sure that their children arrive safely at school. They must not allow drivers to cram their children in a vehicle that is unroadworthy or is driven by someone who isn&rsquo;t licensed.&rdquo; &nbsp; She urged motorists and pedestrians to report overloaded taxis to their nearest traffic authorities.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
