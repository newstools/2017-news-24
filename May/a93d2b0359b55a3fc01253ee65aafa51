They own mansions in townships and rural areas, while they do not pay for water and electricity. It is unfortunate that people prioritise payment for DStv over payment for municipal services. This has to change,&rdquo; the MEC insisted. &nbsp;She told MPLs that managing debt and good governance were crucial for the survival of municipalities.According to the MEC 23 cases of fraud and corruption were reported to her department since last year and this had prompted 23 forensic investigations. Sixteen had been finalised, while seven were pending. The investigations across municipalities in KZN covered areas such as:&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R2.5mn in fruitless and wasteful expenditure. &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Directors who did not have the experience or qualifications to hold senior positions. &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contracts awarded on roads that were never constructed.The MEC said disciplinary action would be taken against senior officials including municipal managers and chief financial officers on the fingered municipalities, while criminal cases would be opened with SAPS and civil recovery would be launched against implicated individuals.According to Dube&ndash;Ncube this was a clear illustration of a department that was keen on dealing with corruption in municipalities.Opposition parties welcomed the MEC&rsquo;s budget, but called for a more even handed approach when conducting investigations, suggesting that Dube-Ncube was more lenient toward ANC controlled councils. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
