The official Xinhua News Agency said on Thursday that the local government in the Tibet region is setting up stations to sort, recycle and break down the garbage, which includes cans, plastic bags, stove equipment, tents, oxygen tanks and other mountain climbing paraphernalia. The nine-day cleanup that began on Saturday targets climbing trails and campsites between 5 200 and 6 500 meters. Parts of Everest are in China and Nepal. Each year, about 60 000 climbers and guides visit the Chinese north side of the mountain, which China refers to by its Tibetan name, Mount Qomolangma. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
