He and his sister survived, but she sustained serious injury to her head.LIVE: Man with panga tried to enter De Zalze estate in 2013, court hearsQuiet nightThe court was also shown video footage of the police vehicle arriving at the contractors' gate at 07:40.The guards would not let him enter at the main gate, but he said it took 12 seconds to get through the contractors' gate. Botha introduced the CCTV footage to illustrate his contention that the security guard was incorrect in saying it had been a quiet night from 23:00 when the restaurant closed, with no other vehicles entering or leaving.The estate also boasted electric fences, bloodhound patrols, and ID registration for builders and contractors as part of its security measures.The court has also heard that on June 9, 2015, an attempt at getting in via a cut fence was made but the perpetrators left when guards went to investigate.The trial continues. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
