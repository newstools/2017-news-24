"When this occurs, the world will be far better prepared," Chan added.In a major clinical trial using an innovative "ring", or group method, nearly 6 000 people in Guinea were given the test vaccine in 2015, during which not one of them contracted the disease.Even with an "initially limited" first batch of the vaccine, Chan said, health authorities had another option in their arsenal "beyond isolation and quarantine".First identified in 1976 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Ebola virus erupted periodically in outbreaks of up to a couple of hundred cases, mainly across west and east Africa.In early 2014, however, a handful of infections in southern Guinea mushroomed rapidly into an epidemic.Chan emphasised that another positive outcome of the Ebola crisis was renewed focus and funding for vaccines against other contagious diseases, including the fatal Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) as well as the Lassa and Nipah viruses."These significant spillover effects strengthen the world's collective defences against the never-ending threat from emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases," she said.Also speaking at the event, President Alpha Conde said it was "time Africa benefited from cutting-edge technology, notably in the field of biomedical sciences," and called on industrialised nations to share their expertise. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
