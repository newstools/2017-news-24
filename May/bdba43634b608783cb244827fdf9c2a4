DA chief whip John Steenhuisen interjected while Zuma said that he trusts the matter will be resolved quickly.Zuma started his speech addressing the recent spate of killings of women, which he described as brutal."Some are killed by men they trusted," he said."Violence against women has been declared a priority crime."He said human trafficking is "despicable", a gross violation of human rights and "tantamount to modern day slavery".He referred to his recent visit to Elsies River in Cape Town, where three-year-old Courtney Pieters was murdered. He said the community told him that the solution to crime will not only come from policing, but that better housing and more social workers are needed.He said families should be strengthened."We need to unify as communities as all sectors... to promote safer communities. United we shall defeat this scourge."The Economic Freedom Fighters, who previously vowed that they will not allow Zuma, who they view as an illegitimate president, to address then, were not present at the sitting.The debate is scheduled to finish approximately at 20:00 Wednesday evening. &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
