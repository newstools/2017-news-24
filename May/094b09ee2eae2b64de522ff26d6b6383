We have been through much worse than this and will be able to discuss this to build and strengthen the alliance."During his address to thousands of Shembe congregants, Ramaphosa said: "I came here for two things; to learn about iNkosi Shembe and also [to] ask that you keep the ANC and the government in your prayers because you have seen that things are not looking good."He highlighted how Zuma couldn't deliver his speech on Workers Day."That alone shows that there is a lot that is not right in our communities. Please pray for the country, the government and the leaders because things are not looking good at all. I have seen for myself today that indeed Shembe is the way."He also commended iNkosi Shembe, a former leader of the church, saying he had worked closely with one of the ANC's founders John Dube."What I also love about this church is how you care about the community. I commend you on that. I wish the ANC can also continue to take care of the needs of the people of South Africa for them to have a better life."Shembe Church right now.
