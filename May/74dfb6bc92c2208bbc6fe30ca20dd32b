Some locals have nicknamed him the "flying" or the "visiting" president.Ongoing cash shortages in Zimbabwe mean long waits in bank queues to withdraw small amounts of cash. Mugabe's government says Zimbabweans should use their bank cards but that's not an option for most vendors, public transport providers and others in the southern African country's vast informal economy.All eyes will be on the ageing leader to see if he falls after pictures of a red carpet stumble in early 2015 sparked a rash of #MugabeFalls memes. Read one tweet: "I hope&nbsp;Mugabe&nbsp;will not fall again @ the World Economic forum in&nbsp;Durban. Madala pliz spare us the embarrassment."State broadcaster ZBC said the aim of this week's WEF Africa is "to ensure Africa generates truly inclusive economic growth that provides everyone with the same opportunity to prosper and achieve such change." Organisers say that more than 100 countries will be represented.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
