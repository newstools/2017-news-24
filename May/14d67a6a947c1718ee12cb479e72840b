Mashaba spoke almost without pausing to breathe as he pointed out, one after the other, what changes he would bring, adding that a key directive in the city&rsquo;s adjusted budget process had been to ensure that a minimum of 60% of capital expenditure must be in poor communities.For Mashaba, the plight of hostel dwellers, some of whom took up DA membership during his campaign trail last year, was one of the priorities for his June 2017/18 budget.&ldquo;We are targeting three hostels,&rdquo; he asserted without revealing much detail.Faced with an enormous housing backlog he traces back to his predecessors, his administration&rsquo;s focus will shift to servicing sites.Historically, the city could only deliver 2 500 to 3 500 houses per year.&ldquo;Instead of building RDP houses, what we want to do is to identify the city&rsquo;s own land and service it. Give it water, electrify, [sewerage systems] and give people title deeds so that when they build their houses, they build them in proper places,&rdquo; he said on the pilot project.Mashaba said he honestly believed almost all the RDP houses built so far were unsuitable for habitation by human beings.&ldquo;We want to give people the opportunity to build their own houses by giving them the serviced stands.&rdquo;He said instead of just building the maximum 3 500 houses, the city would make available the serviced land to allow people on the waiting list to build their homes.Mashaba would not reveal just how much had been allocated to ensure this happened, only saying details would be outlined in his budget speech in a month&rsquo;s time.This will be the first budget of the DA-led coalition government in the city. The administration has been, by law, locked into running the city based on an ANC budget that the coalition adjusted in February, effecting only 10% &ldquo;pro-poor&rdquo; changes under the watchful eye of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). This saw Mashaba scrapping some projects initiated by Tau, labelling them &ldquo;vanity projects&rdquo; meant to &ldquo;benefit cadres&rdquo;. The most contentious was the R1 billion Jozi@Work project.Mashaba will from January initiate the insourcing of security services. Considerations are also being made to insource catering and cleaning services and qualified professionals such as accountants.Outsourcing security services costs the city a staggering R360 million per year. Mashaba could not resist taking aim at Tau, whom he said preached a hollow gospel of a world-class city in the face of corruption that the mayor will continue to expose despite attempts by the ANC to &ldquo;frustrate&rdquo; him.Mashaba said there was a new sheriff in town and people should embrace the new coalition government.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying to everyone ... you are in a safe place, you have a new executive mayor who operates on the basis of consultation and engagement with all the coalition partners, including the EFF. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not what I decided; the voters are our bosses and they decided to vote for this arrangement.TALK TO USDo you think serviced stands are an improvement on RDP houses?SMS us on 35697 using the keyword SAVE and tell us what you think.
