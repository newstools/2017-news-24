Subsequently, with the enactment of the Constitution and the development of common law since its enactment, these decisions, as the president acknowledges, are subject to review."He said it was true that rule 53 had not been amended to cater for this, but to decide on its applicability to review executive decisions, it was necessary to subject the rule to a purposive interpretation."Relying on the purposive interpretation, there is no logical reason not to utilise it in an application to review and set aside an executive decision."The rule could thus be applied to a bid to review and set aside an executive order or decision, Vally said.In court papers, Zuma had said that the DA's urgent application to have reasons for the recent Cabinet reshuffle divulged was misconceived and without merit.The Democratic Alliance filed an urgent application with the court on April 24, to force Zuma to disclose his reasons for reshuffling his Cabinet on March 30.Having succeeded, the DA's next step would be to ask the court to review and set aside his decision to sack Pravin Gordhan as finance minister, and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas.Zuma described it as an abuse of court processes and argued he was exercising his powers in terms of section 91 (2) of the Constitution. He said it was an executive decision that deserved protection from disclosure. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
