Watch. WATCHKimberley - The newly elected provincial executive committee of the African National Congress in the Northern Cape has called on Premier Sylvia Lucas to reverse her controversial cabinet reshuffle.According to the Top Five this was in line with the resolutions taken by the recent 8th Provincial Conference in Colesburg.Provincial secretary Daluxolo Deshi Ngxanga said that the conference reaffirmed the ANC "as the only strategic centre of power", citing both the Polokwane and Mangaung National Conference resolutions of the ANC.Although the new PEC is visibly upset with Lucas, they said no disciplinary steps have been taken against her as yet."We were not elected to be premiers and MECs, we were elected to lead the party," said Zamani Saul."The new provincial executive committee is yet to formally deliberate on the matter."'Precedent'Ngxanga bemoaned the bad precedence set by Lucas in reshuffling her cabinet without consulting the ANC and its alliance partners."We have mayors with members of the executive in municipal councils. We do not want the reshuffle to set the wrong precedent," explained Ngxanga.Saul described Luthuli House's response to the reshuffle as "robust condemnation"."Lucas can't use the president's example of reshuffling the Cabinet without consulting. In fact the president [President Jacob Zuma] apologised for doing that."No-one voted for Lucas to be premier; voters voted for the ANC," added Saul.However, he also defended the premier saying that the Democratic Alliance was wrong to say she was "the worst performing premier".He said the ANC was performing well citing good prospects for the 2019 general election.During a press briefing earlier, Saul said Lucas claimed to have no idea about the apparent R26m that was allegedly stolen from the provincial treasury to fund the conference.Saul explained that the conference was solely funded from the political party fund allocation.Saul called for unity of all opposing groups in the interests of service delivery.He cited several reports by secretary general Gwede Mantashe describing the ANC in the Northern Cape as the "most stable and united"."This conference was not like Moshaweng where John Block beat Neville Mompati by a mere 41 votes. We do not foresee any splits."He was referring to the 2009 elections where the ANC's majority was weakened by new kids on the block, Cope after unhappiness about the results of that conference in 2008.The ANC will also investigate the source of the "false" allegations relating to the R26m. It is also presently the subject of a Hawks investigation.Regional general councils will be convened to acquaint members with the resolutions taken at the last conference, including reversing Lucas's reshuffle.Meanwhile Lucas has since issued a statement saying while she had met with the Top Five of the ANC, she did not concede to the request made by the officials to reverse her decision."What she did commit to, was to consult with all the relevant stakeholders and legislative prescripts before making a decision on the matter. This decision she will then communicate to the officials," the statement read.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
