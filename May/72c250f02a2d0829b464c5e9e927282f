	     Johannesburg – Estate agent Vicki Momberg, who is facing four charges of crimen injuria, appeared on the same charge in Durban approximately 11 years ago. Momberg, who hails from Durban, is appearing in the Randburg Regional Court on charges that on February 3, 2016, she insulted a police officer and at least four telephone operators at the Gauteng 10111 emergency call centre. State prosecutor Yusuf Baba said on Monday that a Durban police officer had also laid a charge of crimen injuria against Momberg in 2006, Netwerk24 reported. At the time, she had apparently walked into a police station and demanded that she be helped by "a white person, a Coloured person or an Indian", but not a black person. In a video taken last year, Momberg also says: "I am happy if a white person helps me, or a Coloured person, or an Indian. I don’t want to be helped by a black person." In this video, she calls the police officers the K-word and and complains about the "calibre of black people" in Johannesburg. "They are stubborn, arrogant and plain useless," she said. Although the charge in Durban had been withdrawn, Baba said on Monday it served as character evidence. 'Wouldn't wish it on anybody' Momberg has pleaded not guilty to the four charges she is facing in the Randburg Regional Court, offering non-pathological unaccountability as defence. She maintains that the comments were not aimed specifically at the witnesses. Momberg admitted on Monday that she had made racist comments towards the police officers last year, but that she "can’t remember" what she had said. She only became aware of the comments when the station manager of the Douglasdale police station informed her in April last year that Constable David Mkhondo, who works there, had laid a charge against her. Mkhondo testified in March that he had asked a colleague to record video of Momberg lashing out at him. Momberg said, "I have seen the video and I don’t approve of it. I wouldn’t wish it on anybody." She said she had wanted to visit the police station to apologise to Mkhondo, but the station commander had said Mkhondo wasn’t interested. She eventually apologised in a letter addressed to Mkhondo on January 30. The case resumes on Thursday. *Momberg is also facing a charge in the Equality Court in Randburg. The SA Human Rights Commission has requested that she pay a fine of R150 000.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
