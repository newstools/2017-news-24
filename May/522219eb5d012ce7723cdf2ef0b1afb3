Streets in Algiers were nearly deserted Thursday morning -- although polling stations were expected to be busier in the afternoon.In a video posted online days before polling day and seen by more than two million people, one Algerian said the government had broken its promises to tackle an acute housing shortage and improve health care.Despite that, Bouteflika's National Liberation Front (FLN) and its coalition ally, the Rally for National Democracy (RND), are expected to keep their majority in parliament.In the 2012 election, the FLN, which dominated Algerian politics since independence in 1962, won 221 of the 462 seats in parliament.Worst ever electoral defeatIslamists, who held 60 seats in the outgoing parliament, represent the country's main opposition force.In the last election, held a year after Arab Spring-inspired street protests, they had hoped to replicate the gains of their peers in Egypt and Tunisia.Instead, they suffered their worst ever electoral defeat.This year, they have formed two electoral alliances in bids to do better.But since Algeria adopted a multi-party system in 1989, the opposition has repeatedly accused the ruling parties of electoral fraud.Turnout has often been low, registering 43.14 percent in 2012 and 35.65 percent in 2007.Even those figures were inflated, experts say.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
