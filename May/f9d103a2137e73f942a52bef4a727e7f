But they were refused on security grounds.Ibrahim Liman, a member of the civilian militia assisting the military with security, gave an identical account.Shuwari Buri is in the Konduga area, some 40km southeast of the Borno state capital, Maiduguri, which has been repeatedly hit by suicide bombings and gun attacks.Boko Haram has increasingly used suicide bombers to attack civilian targets including mosques, schools, markets and bus stations.Many of the bombers have been women and young girls.The phenomenon has increased as the Islamist militants lost captured territory to the military due to a sustained counter-insurgency that began in early 2015.The rebels' push for a hardline Islamic state in the region has left at least 20 000 people dead in Nigeria alone and displaced more than 2.6 million others.Civilians are still facing the fall-out from the conflict: 5.1 million people are severely food insecure and dependent on handouts from aid agencies.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
