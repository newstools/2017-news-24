During his latest Cabinet reshuffle on March 30, Zuma removed Ramatlhodi from his Cabinet altogether.Ramatlhodi was replaced by Mosebenzi Zwane, who allegedly had close ties to the Guptas and allegedly met Glencore CEO Ivan Glasenberg in Zurich to facilitate the sale of the mine to the Gupta&rsquo;s Tegeta Exploration and Resources.&ldquo;It shows the extent to which President Zuma, other ministers, officials in state-owned enterprises and their cronies in the Gupta family have indulged in an orgy of looting of public resources and self-enrichment through the manipulation of tenders in both the state and state-owned enterprises,&rdquo; Saftu said.Saftu demanded the removal of the Eskom board and the Cabinet, and for Zuma to withdraw his court challenge to former public protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s State of Capture report.Zuma should instead implement the report&rsquo;s central recommendation, which was to set up an independent commission to investigate and report on alleged state capture. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
