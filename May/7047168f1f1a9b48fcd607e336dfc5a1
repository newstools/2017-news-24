What we are doing with Unicef is to see if we can provide facilities at a cheaper cost to ensure that we have more sexual offences courts."Dey said activists and civil society organisations in the sector were not consulted about the aims behind this partnership.Sanja Bornman, of Lawyers for Human Rights&rsquo; gender equality programme, said any plan to reduce resources to sexual offences courts undermined the reason for bringing them back. A decision had been made to reintroduce these courts based on recommendations by a task team and civil society backed the idea.&ldquo;It would be unacceptable for the state to now go half-way on implementation. They knew what it would cost when the decision was made,&rdquo; Bornman said.The organisations said sexual offences courts were scrapped from the South African criminal justice system, despite their success, in or around 2008.Due to civil society demand and escalating sexual violence against women and children, the specialised courts were reintroduced by an act of Parliament which the president signed in January 2014. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
