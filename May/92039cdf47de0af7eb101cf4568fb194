By paying people to come and remove MPs for things that they say as 'dangerous work' creates legitimate basis for fear, and thus, speech can no longer be considered to be free in parliament," said Ndlozi.Mbete is willing to take tax payers' money and pamper the white shirts for assaulting MPs, he said."In the process no care is given whatsoever to the injury of MPs, EFF women in particular who have been assaulted at the hands of Mbete's professional hooligans," Ndlozi said.This proves yet again that Parliament is willing to do everything, including compensated violence, to suppress speech all because they do not want the truth."Mbete has created a situation where there is more freedom of speech outside parliament, in places like taxi ranks, than there is inside Parliament," Ndlozi concluded.Parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mothapo told City Press: "It is common knowledge that they [bouncers] often suffer injuries as a result of physical assault, which in the past has resulted in hospitalisation and the need for professional counselling."Mothapo also said the danger pay was "an additional compensation above basic compensation granted to employees serving in risky and harmful situations", the City Press reported. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
