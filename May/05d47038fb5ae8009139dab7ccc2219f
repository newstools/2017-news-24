Deep and racial disparities persist,&rdquo; Statistician-General Pali Lehohla said.The main reasons given for not attending an educational institution were no money for fees or poor academic performance. In addition, nearly 10% of men and 4.9% of women who took part in the survey believed education was useless.The statistics show vast gender disparities. Over 18% of women surveyed were unable to attend an educational facility because of family commitments.
