Many judges see the law as an infringement of the judiciary's independence and a violation of the principle of the separation of government branches.Before the new law came into effect, each branch of the judiciary nominated their most senior judge to head their branch, with the president's ratification a foregone conclusion.President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi will now have to either ratify Dakroury's nomination to avoid a confrontation with the powerful State Council or independently name one of the most senior judges from that branch as its head.Dakroury's ruling last year on the fate of the two islands went against the government's stated position that Tiran and Sanafir, at the mouth of the Red Sea's Gulf of Aqaba, belonged to Saudi Arabia but were placed under Egyptian control in the 1950s to protect them against a perceived threat from Israel.His ruling was upheld in January by a higher court, which declared as unconstitutional an Egyptian-Saudi agreement signed in April 2016 to cede control over the islands to Riyadh.Al-Sisi last month said the executive branch has nothing more to do with or say about the agreement, saying its fate was now in the hands of the judiciary and parliament, a 596-seat chamber packed with his supporters.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
