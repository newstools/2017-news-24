Instead, the [police] chose to reduce 'Project Impimpi', eliminate Vearey and Jacobs, and that's only the present situation,'' he submitted.In December 2016, Netwerk24 reported that a former policeman, Christiaan Prinsloo, was sentenced to 18 years for his role in a gun smuggling network.The first death linked via ballistics to one of the stolen firearms was in February 2010.Security clearanceThree-year-old Leshay Arnold was struck by a stray bullet fired from one of the firearms, the Netwerk24 report said.In 2011, three teens, Sedick Cochraine ,18, Dillan Hendricks, 17, and Nazeed Sadan, 18, were killed with the firearms.On Thursday Donen said: ''Daily we read about how the gangs are using firearms and murdering people and very often little children [are killed].''In those circumstances the transfers of Jacobs and Vearey from the leading roles that they played, to benign posts as cluster commanders, is not in the public interest.''Earlier the court heard Jacobs was moved to make way for Major-General Mzwandile Tiyo who had no security clearance.The court also heard that they submitted representations over the transfers, but that these were allegedly ignored.They allege that proper process was not followed over their transfer and they want the court to review it.They are members of the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union, which is supporting their case.The case has been set down for two days and will continue on Friday afternoon.Advocate Alec Freund SC represents Acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
