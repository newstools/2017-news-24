It fragments revenue collection."He said the Guptas are the problem, claiming it was them instructing the ANC to move revenue collection to Home Affairs.New home affairs minister Hlengiwe Mkhize however said opposition parties did not read the new amendment bill, saying BMA will not handle customs.All revenue collected will be sent to SARS for handling.She said the bill was necessary, as the government was listening to citizens that South Africa's borders "were porous".Around 1% of all tax revenue is collected at the border.Former finance minister Pravin Gordhan, who raised concerns over the costs of establishing the authority while finance minister, was not present in the House on Thursday to vote. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
