During the pre-trial of businessman Irshaad Laher and Alan Raves in the Western Cape High Court, the State claimed that Laher&rsquo;s defence team had documents in its possession that it had not handed over.Judge Robert Henney said it was an extraordinary case and that he usually only granted short postponements.He begrudgingly granted a postponement for further investigation until September 22. Laher is out on bail of R100 000.&nbsp;His co-accused Alan Raves has missed a number of court appearances because of ill health.According to an indictment, the pair face a raft of charges ranging from racketeering and corruption, to theft and possession of prohibited firearms.Laher is accused of buying guns from ex-police officer Chris Prinsloo of Vereeniging, who was recently sentenced to 18 years behind bars after entering a plea and sentence agreement with the State.He pleaded guilty to 11 charges including theft, racketeering and money laundering.Prinsloo, a former police colonel, was in charge of the police armoury and stole 2 400 guns over almost a decade.In his plea agreement, Prinsloo said he provided guns to a man in Cape Town.Prinsloo apparently met Laher in Gauteng when he was a police officer and Laher a reservist.After his arrest he told police that he sold about 2 000 guns to Laher, the State alleges.Raves was arrested in August 2015 after several guns ranging from assault rifles to smaller calibre arms were seized.Prinsloo pleaded guilty to stealing guns and ammunition destined for destruction and reselling them, primarily to gangs on the Cape Flats.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
