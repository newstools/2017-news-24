I took charge of the scene," he testified, referring to the Gugulethu incident."I arranged that forensics arrived on the scene, as horrific as it was."ShockedKnipe said that together with another sergeant, he had noted what each of the seven killed had on them.One was lying with his stomach on the ground and it was feared there was a hand grenade beneath him.The area was cleared."A rope was tied to the belt of the deceased and he was pulled over to see what was there," Knipe said.He denied "sweeping" the scene as Lincoln had alleged."There was criticism [relating to] arrangements I had made to wash blood off the streets afterward&hellip; But this was standard procedure," Knipe said.He said he knew nothing about the Community House incident and was shocked that Lincoln had alleged he did.In 1996, former president Nelson Mandela tasked Lincoln with heading up a presidential investigative task unit to investigate Cape Town-based Italian mafioso Vito Palazzolo.Lincoln was tasked with, among other matters, investigating Palazzolo's links to government officials, police and businessmen.But he was instead arrested on an array of charges linked to Palazzolo.Lincoln is therefore claiming R15m in damages from the minister of police.
