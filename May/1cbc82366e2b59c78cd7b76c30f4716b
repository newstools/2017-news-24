It&rsquo;s too many because we are making it a norm. It cannot be a norm, this thing of other women dying&hellip;[the men are entirely silent], father God where are the fathers? Where are the fathers that can stand in a society of SA and say &lsquo;this is no more?&rsquo;&rdquo; she asked.Actor, Patrick Shai &ndash; who is also a family friend &ndash; delivered an impromptu speech, saying that men needed to take more action. He said that there were numerous dialogues and forums on women and child abuse throughout South Africa, but men were not heeding the call or coming forward.&ldquo;When are we as [men] going to take our position in society, our position in families, and come to the defence of our women and children?
