She said it had been part of a series of "reflective tweets" about how Singapore had "repurpose[d] aspects of colonialism&rsquo;s legacy to build, strong inclusive economies" &ndash; but that the social media message had then been "deconstructed and distorted".'Shift in politics'The backlash against it, suggested Zille, was a symptom of a "tectonic shift" in South African politics. "The Mandela era has come to an end."Instead, this had been replaced with a critical race theory which positioned whiteness and whites as key obstacles to the progress of black people in South Africa.Earlier this month, the DA announced that a formal disciplinary hearing would be instituted against Zille after it was alleged that she had violated the party&rsquo;s federal constitution by acting in a manner which had brought the party into disrepute. "She is charged with having broadly brought the party into disrepute and damaging the party," the DA's federal chairperson James Selfe told News24.The formal charges against Zille follow an interim report by Advocate Glynnis Breytenbach, chairperson of the DA's federal legal commission, which was completed on March 25.&nbsp;"Breytenbach's preliminary investigation found that Helen had a case to answer," Selfe said.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
