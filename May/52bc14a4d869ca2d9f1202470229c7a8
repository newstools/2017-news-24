However, he will be guided by his legal team on a way forward."On Friday, Judge Bill Prinsloo dismissed Mabuza's case against Phosa and made a costs order against the premier.Phosa, a former Mpumalanga premier, got the spy report from his former butler, Jan Venter. Phosa handed it to ANC deputy general secretary Jessie Duarte.Venter testified that he overheard a conversation in which Phosa made the spy allegations. Prinsloo dismissed Venter as an extremely poor witness.Prinsloo said he was left with the impression that Mabuza could have channelled money to Venter. He said Mabuza accused Phosa of authoring the report, even before he had been told of claims that Phosa wrote it.Prinsloo criticised Mabuza's failure to testify to clarify this discrepancy and to refute the allegations against him."Mabuza's attempt to smear me has failed, thank God," Phosa said after Friday's judgment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
