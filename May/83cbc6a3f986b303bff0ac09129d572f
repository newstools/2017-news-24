MIND is a continental institute that seeks to address the short, medium, and long-term development challenges in Africa. Moyo, who is also Zimbabwe's former industry and trade minister, said he would announce his decision soon, New Zimbabwe.com reported."I've been seriously considering running for the presidency&hellip; I am taking my time but I will definitely announce something to the people in the next few weeks. It&rsquo;s a thing which I have been seriously considering for a very long time," Moyo was quoted as saying. He said this on the sidelines of a discussion on regenerating Zimbabwe's industries in a global economy that was held at the National University of Science and Technology in Bulawayo this week. A News Day report said that as a politician, Moyo once registered as an independent candidate in Harare in the June 2000 elections but withdrew from the race after realising that his agenda "might not make it with the public".After President Robert Mugabe emerged as the winner of the vote that same year, he was lucky to be appointed as a minister by the veteran leader. He, however, left the Cabinet post "after being frustrated by Zanu-PF's lawlessness which led to the seizure of white-owned farms and businesses by party activists and failed economic policies".Mugabe, at the time, described him as "spineless". Voice of America (VOA) quoted a political analyst Pedzisai Ruhanya as saying that Moyo was likely not to succeed in his ambitions, as Zimbabwean people were used to voting for political parties and not individuals.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
