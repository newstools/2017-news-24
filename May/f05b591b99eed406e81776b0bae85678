The development raises the possibility that Uber may end up dumping Anthony Levandowski, whose expertise in robot-controlled cars is the main reason that the company bought Levandowski's startup for $680m in 2016. Waymo, a self-driving car company started by Google, alleges Levandowski downloaded 14 000 documents containing its trade secrets before he founded his startup. Levandowski has asserted his rights under the Fifth Amendment since Waymo filed its lawsuit in February. But Uber is warning Levandowski that he may lose his job unless he waives those rights and reveals whether he took any Waymo documents. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
