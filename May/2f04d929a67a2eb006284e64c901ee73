It's not a murder, it's a hate crime."I cannot walk freely in a street of my choice with my husband, holding his hand. I cannot go to certain parts of the country. And it's worse for women and even worse for black women who are lesbian.""The government has now gone on to insult us because queer lives and women's lives do not matter to this government."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
