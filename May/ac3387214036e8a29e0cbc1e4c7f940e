I meet&nbsp; lotsa people all the time would you like&nbsp; to no&nbsp; WHO THEY ARE ASWELL [sic]."He then sent an email headed "WE HAVE EYES EVERY WHR [sic]."Accompanied was a photograph of the News24 journalist at the hotel where he had the meeting on Thursday night.The body of the email said: "WE HAVE EYES EVERY WHR&nbsp; HAVE A GREAT DAY FURTHER [sic]."Asked via email if this was a threat or an attempt to intimidate the journalist and why he would react in this manner, Modack denied this.He replied via email: "NOT AT ALL , JUST LETTING U NO WHO MY GUYS PICKED UP WHO WAS WATCHING ME AS I HAVE PEOPLE ALL AROUND , I DNT EVEN NO WHOS IN THE PIC NO ONE HAVE A REASON TO THREATEN YOU AN I WOLUDNT ALLOW ANY PNE TO DO THAT HAVE A GREAT DAY [sic]."Email threat sent to News24 journalist. (Supplied)Underworld turf warModack then later sent another email, in response to the question on whether he was threatening the journalist.It said: "If it came across that way then my apologies."News24 editor Adriaan Basson said he was shocked by Modack's blatant attempts to intimidate Dolley."Modack's strategy is clear: He wants to intimidate us in the hope that we will cease from reporting on the underworld wars taking place on the streets of Cape Town. We will not retreat," said Basson."Caryn has been at the forefront of reporting on the bloody battles around the so-called control of Cape Town's nightclubs. If state agencies are involved in this, the public should know. Modack's attempts to intimidate us will propel us to dedicate even more resources to this important story."The underworld turf war appears to have intensified after March 30 when two of Modack's properties were to be auctioned off in the northern suburbs.A massive brawl broke out at the second property in Parow.Controversial businessman Andre Naude and Mark Lifman, who previously headed a nightclub security company, were present when this had happened.Later that night, Modack and a group of men had gone to a popular strip club in the city centre and took over security there - the first of several clubs where they took over security operations.Police were called to the scene, but no arrests were made.Previously asked why he had decided to take over control of club security, Modack told News24: "I did warn them u wana take wats mine il take wats yours 2nyt an I dun just that, im no gangster im a businessman and only fear god no one else [sic]." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
