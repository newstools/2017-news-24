I assure you, this will make no difference at all to the ANC,&rdquo; he said in Matjhabeng during a two-day visit to the Free State.Maimane is on his National #Change19 Tour throughout the country.According to Maimane the culture of corruption and stealing money that was meant for communities &ldquo;is part of the ANC now&rdquo;.&ldquo;Replacing Zuma with someone else will just increase your suffering. When I talk about change on this tour, I mean total change. I mean a whole new way of looking at South Africa.&rdquo;He criticised Free State Premier Ace Magashule saying he together with Zuma make promises to rich friends.&ldquo;Communities like yours here in Matjhabeng are fast being forgotten by a government that promised to take you forward, but has no intention of honouring that promise.&rdquo;He added that South Africa had entered its second struggle era.&ldquo;This time [it is] the struggle for economic freedom for all. The struggle to escape the economic oppression of ANC rule.&rdquo;He said South Africans needed to start thinking beyond political divides.&ldquo;We need to start seeing those who want to build the same South Africa as we do as our allies.&rdquo;Maimane added that a new government that rescues SA from the ANC would have to be built on coalitions and cooperation.&ldquo;This is how we are busy turning metros like Johannesburg, Tshwane and Nelson Mandela Bay around, and this is how we will turn South Africa around.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
