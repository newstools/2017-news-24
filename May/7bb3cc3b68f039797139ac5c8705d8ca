Sadag thus withdrew its court case, which was due in court on December 22, 2015.The Gauteng health department, however, failed to provide a plan for the patient transfers.In March 2016, Section 27 rushed to court to interdict the Gauteng Department of Health from moving the patients but did not cite him as a respondent. He was, therefore, unaware of it. Section 27 lost the bid for an interdict.'Completely shocked'He only learnt about the deaths of the mentally-ill patients when then Gauteng health MEC Qedani Mahlangu told the provincial legislature that 36 had died, he said."I was completely shocked and could not comprehend the whole thing. I immediately contacted the Health Ombudsperson Professor Malegapuru Makgoba to investigate."Over 100 patients died as a result of being transferred to facilities not equipped to look after them, Makgoba said in a report released in February. Many more were still at risk.Democratic Alliance MP Wilmot James on Monday said Motsoaledi's reply should move him to support the call for a judicial commission of inquiry into the tragedy as further details of gross negligence, misconduct and misleading actions emerged.DA leader Mmusi Maimane wrote to President Jacob Zuma in January asking him to establish the commission."There are still too many unanswered questions, and the DA believes that the Gauteng government must be held to account for their reckless decision that cost more than 100 mental health patients their lives," James said.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
