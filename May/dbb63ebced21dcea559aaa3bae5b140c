National Child Protection Week is held in South Africa annually to raise awareness of the rights of children - the theme for 2017 is "Let Us All Protect Children to Move South Africa Forward." South Africa's Constitution states that every child has the right to be protected from maltreatment, neglect, abuse or degradation. It is incumbent on all of South Africans to play a role in protecting children and create a safe and secure environment for them. This year, the focus is on child labour and exploitation as well as unaccompanied minors from neighbouring countries.The aim of child protection is to ensure the safety, well-being, care and protection of children. South Africa has drafted legislation, based on the United Convention of the Rights of the Child, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the Constitution. The latter states that every child has the right to be protected from maltreatment, neglect, abuse or degradation.For any child, or anyone aware of a child in need assistance is available at: Department of Social Development has a 24-hour call centre dedicated to provide support and counselling to victims of gender based violence : call 24-hour toll-free number - 0800 428 428, free SMS line by dialling *120*7867#, call ChildLine toll-free number 0800 055 555 or Child Welfare South Africa: 0861 4 Child (24453) or 011 452 4110, or e-mail info@childwelfaresa.org.za24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
