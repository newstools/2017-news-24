He basically manipulated me into feeling sorry for him about how what happened to my brother had affected him".Renisha said her mother is now using medication because she had a breakdown after Nemeth&rsquo;s visit.'Extraordinarily unscrupulous'Montano said according to the post-mortem, Jimmy&rsquo;s body was "severely charred"."There were no external injuries and no discernible evidence of gunshot wounds. There was also a large amount of soot in his trachea, which means he was still alive during the fire."According to him there was, however, a hole behind Jimmy&rsquo;s head."The pathologist consequently investigated it. As a result of the intense heat of the fire, Reshall&rsquo;s skull had cracked. This is a common occurrence among victims of fires."Klatsow said in his 34 years of experience, the Jimmy case is "extraordinarily unscrupulous"."Nemeth is dreaming up one version after the other to absolve Ford of any blame."The family is now insisting on a judicial inquiry into the cause of death.Asked for comment, Ford SA spokesperson Minesh Bhagaloo said, "We realise how devastating the loss of Reshall Jimmy must be for his family."Because of the sensitive nature and unique circumstances surrounding Jimmy&rsquo;s death and the probability of legal action, we have nothing further to say on this matter."Netwerk24 tried contacting Nemeth on his cellphone, but according to a service provider message the number no longer exists. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
