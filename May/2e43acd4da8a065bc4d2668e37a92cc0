Today [Tuesday] was the first time she&rsquo;d been a bit late. She had said she wasn&rsquo;t feeling well," said Henning Pieters, the school&rsquo;s principal.According to Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, the teacher had gone to the staff room and told colleagues that she wasn&rsquo;t feeling well. She collapsed and help was immediately summoned, Netwerk24 reported."Her colleagues tried to resuscitate her, but unfortunately she died," said Lesufi.He couldn&rsquo;t confirm the exact cause of death.The 67-year-old woman, whose name has not yet been released, was appointed in March as a remedial English teacher for Grade 8 to Grade 12 pupils.Favourite among teachers and pupils"She had already retired, but agreed to offer extra English lessons at the school," Lesufi said.Pieters said despite the fact that she hadn&rsquo;t been at the school for a long time, she had become a favourite among both teachers and pupils."She was a soft soul who loved children and teaching. One could see how much she loved teaching by the fact that she came back to help children with their English even after retiring."Pieters said pupils and other teachers were shocked by her death.The school closed for the day in the wake of news of the teacher&rsquo;s death."It would have been unfair to expect teachers to give lessons after one of their colleagues died. That&rsquo;s why we suspended classes for the rest of the day. Classes would resume as normal on Wednesday," Lesufi said."Death is a fact of life and it is important that pupils learn this. That is why it will be back to normal on Wednesday," said Pieters.Counsellors were at the school to support pupils, teachers and relatives.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
