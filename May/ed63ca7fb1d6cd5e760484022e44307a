Communal taps in KwaPhupha in Willowfountain ran dry in February last year and in spite of the construction of a new reservoir, the water supply has not resumed, GroundUp reports. Water is supplied by a water tanker which is in the area for less than 15 minutes, leaving many residents without water.&ldquo;We have no choice but to fetch water from the river,&rdquo; said Samkelo Ngcobo. &ldquo;We share the river water with cows. One has to wake up as early as possible before the cows reach the river. &ldquo;If you are late, there&rsquo;s no way to come back with clean water. When cows get into the river the water is diluted with mud or dung. New reservoir&ldquo;Those who are health conscious boil the river water before using it so that they don&rsquo;t get sick.&rdquo;Ngcobo said that the community had breathed &ldquo;a sigh of relief&rdquo; when a new reservoir was built in Willowfountain, but water had not been supplied to the KwaPhupha community. &ldquo;Nothing has changed. It is very tough especially for some of our elderly neighbours. Most grandmothers stay with younger children who cannot carry 20 litre containers.&rdquo; Pensioner Sizakele Mchunu, 70, said her neighbour&rsquo;s children helped her get water from the tanker or from the river. Mchunu has arthritis and she always misses the water tanker because it doesn&rsquo;t stay for long. Water issue&ldquo;I cannot walk properly and it&rsquo;s difficult for me to be on time when the water tanker is here. They take my water container and sometimes it returns empty. Sometimes I have to pay them to fetch the water from the river,&rdquo; said Mchunu. Ward councillor Thabiso Molefe said there were plans to connect the community to the reservoir.&ldquo;It is a tough challenge but we are working on it. We are appealing to the community to be patient while we are trying to work on this water issue", said Molefe.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
