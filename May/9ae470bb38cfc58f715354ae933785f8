So I ask you, on what basis do you think people get chosen?&rdquo;&ldquo;I stand here today, unperturbed. You see, this programme was a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing.&rdquo;Socio-economic criteriaHis administration would revamp the programme to cut the middlemen out of the equation. Work opportunities would be fairly allocated on a rotational basis, using a legitimate indigent register.The only criterion for placement on the list would be socio-economic.&ldquo;Despite what critics say, this move will not kill work opportunities. Instead it will increase the amount of people who can fairly benefit from these temporary work opportunities,&rdquo; Mashaba said.After Mashaba took office following the local government elections in 2016, he announced his intention to scrap the Jozi@Work, Jozi Bread, Jozi Mushroom Farmers and Jozi Mini Cities projects. His predecessor Parks Tau started them in 2014 to create jobs.In February, police fired rubber bullets when anti-Mashaba marchers stormed the City Council building. The Johannesburg Social Movement, which led the march, called on Mashaba to resign.The protesters claimed that up to 8 000 jobs would be lost from the scrapping of the Jozi@Work initiative alone.On Wednesday, the ANC&rsquo;s Johannesburg spokesperson Jolidee Matongo said Mashaba&rsquo;s decision to scrap the programme was &ldquo;anti-poor&rdquo;.&ldquo;The cancellation of Jozi@Work programme practically condemns 8 000 people to unemployment and prevents a further 50 000 Joburgers from benefiting from the programme over the next four years,&rdquo; Matongo said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
