The court denied him leave to appeal.In September 2016, the Supreme Court of Appeal also denied him leave to appeal.During Wednesday's sitting, Thembeka Ngcukaitobi for the SABC said Motsoeneng maligned the broadcaster's newly-appointed board during his media briefing.He had expressed disapproval of some of the new board members and justified his reasons for the SABC's 90% local content policy.He was later charged with breaching the relationship of trust with the board and bringing the public broadcaster into disrepute.'Unfair'Bester argued that acting CEO James Aguma authorised the briefing.Ngcukaitobi said Aguma only gave permission for Motsoeneng to hold a briefing to correct a statement relating to the parliamentary ad hoc committee which looked into the fitness of the SABC board to hold office."He does not say: 'I gave you permission to malign the board.'"Bester argued that it was unfair for Motsoeneng to be subjected to two disciplinary hearings. His second hearing relates to charges stemming from Madonsela's report, titled When Governance and Ethics Fail.She found that he had lied about his qualifications when he applied to work at the SABC, purged staff, and increased his salary exorbitantly.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
