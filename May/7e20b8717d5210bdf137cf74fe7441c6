He wasn&rsquo;t put in a position where he had to give information," she said.She further pointed out that the essence of the statement&rsquo;s content was not disputed, as it is a record of what is already before the court."At the time of making it, there was no incriminating evidence against the accused," she said."The content does not amount to confession or admissions &ndash; it is a witness statement."Van Breda never indicated that he was dissatisfied with the police's conduct, Galloway added.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
