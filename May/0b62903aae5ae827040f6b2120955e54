This was the first since.'Going rogue'Scopa chairperson Themba Godi noted the irony that the two worst performing departments were the ones responsible for maintaining law and order."The ones that must ensure that the law is enforced, are the ones who have gone rogue," Godi said during the meeting.Godi told News24 after the meeting that it was sad that those departments had individuals within them who had not declared their business interests."What it means, is that somebody decided to go and compete for a tender in government, knowing very well that it may be against the law."But on top of that, somebody else, a manager who should have scrutinised that individual, did then not take action or perform oversight."When asked about the high police numbers, he said: "It tells us we have a police service with quite a high number of unethical police officers, yet they are supposed to be the primary enforcers of law in society."He said the Hawks, too, have outstanding disciplinary cases it must settle so that it can assist Scopa with investigations.He said Scopa will now be asking for those departments to make implicated individuals appear before the committee in the coming weeks, along with their managers, to account for their conflicts of interest. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
