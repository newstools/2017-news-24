Meanwhile, a former Zimbabwe National Students Union (Zinasu) president, who is now an activist with the Zimbabwe Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union, Pride Nkomo, said that naming an institution after Mugabe would be "a big insult to academics".This come a week after reports said that authorities in the southern African country had begun a process of "setting up" the new institution, which was being billed as a "smart" university, likely to specialise in engineering. The flagship University of Zimbabwe was reportedly going to play a part in the establishment of the new institution. The University of Zimbabwe controversially awarded Grace Mugabe a PhD in 2014, three months after it was reported that she'd signed up for it.Separate reports suggested that the university could be built in Mazowe, where Grace Mugabe already has a dairy, an orphanage, a private school, and land.&nbsp;The southern African country already has a&nbsp;Robert Mugabe&nbsp;School of Intelligence, which was set up in 2007 near Harare.&nbsp;But, according to Higher Education Minister Jonathan Moyo, that school was not enough. He tweeted last week that "a future dictator" would not be able to change the name of the yet-to-be-built university.Some social media users had, however, mocked the planned university, with some even suggesting that qualifications from the said institution were likely to be useless pieces of paper.&nbsp;Twitter Reaction&nbsp;The Robert Mugabe Foundation is entitled to build a University in Pres Mugabe's name &amp; not even a future dictatorship would change the name! https://t.co/slxPdMBApy@ZimMediaReview It would rate as well as Air Zimbabwe in Europe.@ZimMediaReview Zero, judging with his governance@ZimMediaReview A degree in democracy &amp; good governance from that uni might be slightly frowned upon I suppose24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
