The defence felt it was confusing to only refer to photos.Judge Taswell Papier agreed that it would be a good idea to visit Town Two.The accused, who are cousins, have pleaded not guilty to raping and strangling Mafevuka on March 2, 2016, and dumping her body in a communal ablution block in SST Block, Town Two.Her naked body was found slumped over a toilet. Her clothes had been stuffed into the cistern.Prosecutor Ralph Zeeman said a response team would be arranged to accompany the convoy to Khayelitsha.&ldquo;The area has to be cordoned off and arrangements have to be made for the inspection to proceed,&rdquo; he said.The court heard it would be difficult to proceed with other witnesses between now and Monday because the questioning related to the scene, where people lived and what was observed.The matter was postponed for the inspection on Monday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
