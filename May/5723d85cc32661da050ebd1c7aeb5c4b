	     Johannesburg – Seventeen suspects are expected to appear at the Springs Magistrate’s Court on Friday on charges of contravening the Sexual Offences Act, the Gauteng police said on Thursday. Members of the Ekhurhuleni East Cluster Task Group made the arrest at around 22:00 in Springs, East of Johannesburg. Gauteng police spokesperson, Kay Makhubela, said a woman, who had run away from an alleged brothel, tipped off the police about a house in the area. After informing the police about the alleged brothel, she was taken to a place of safety, Makhubela said. “Eleven women in their early twenties, six men aged between 19 and 42 were found at an alleged brothel and they were arrested.  Female and male condoms were recovered.” Gauteng provincial commissioner, Lieutenant General Deliwe de Lange, said the police would ensure the safety of women and children in the country.     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
