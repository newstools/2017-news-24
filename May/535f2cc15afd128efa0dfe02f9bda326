Nzokira stressed the race was totally non-political in nature and "we just want to promote a climate of security, peace in Burundi and tell the young people of the region they can come and invest here".Several residents of Bujumbura, however, told AFP very few people turned out to watch the race.Friday evening saw two assailants throw two grenades injuring one person near the Louis Rwagasore stadium which was where Saturday's race started.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
