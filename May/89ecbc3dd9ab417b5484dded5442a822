To get Poppie on all fours again, she might need an operation costing thousands, which I don&rsquo;t have," said Stronza. She turned to crowdfunding to get the money needed for the operation."In the blink of an eye we had collected more than enough (almost $8 000, or more than R107 000) and Poppie&rsquo;s road to recovery could begin."She says the pooch won&rsquo;t ever return her "stolen heart", but also that she wouldn&rsquo;t be reclaiming it in any case."I love Poppie so much and I&rsquo;m grateful for the love she has elicited. She caused a worldwide community of love. Everyone agrees, she radiates love," said Stronza.Poppie now commutes between a specialist veterinary centre in Randpark Ridge, Johannesburg, and Dr Suzette Greubel of the Greenside animal hospital where she will have to undergo tests to see if an operation would help her."The good news doesn&rsquo;t end after the operation. We have already found a home for Poppie. Once the operation is over, this brave little dog will fly all the way to America where her new family is waiting," said Stronza.MaryBeth Hastings and her husband, Howard Wilkins, are waiting for Poppie in Takoma Park, Washington DC, along with their daughters Molly, 10, and Sydney, 14.They have decided to adopt Poppie regardless of the outcome of the operation.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
