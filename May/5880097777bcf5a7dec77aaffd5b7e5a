"Next to it, a bowl was found containing dates and other fruits, which could have been presented as an offering."In ancient Egypt, the dead were traditionally surrounded by objects they enjoyed in life, so they could continue to enjoy them in the afterlife.The team also discovered a small mud-brick temple attached to the tomb containing three stone slabs, one of which contained a dedication to the Egyptian gods Montu, Ptah, Sokar and Osiris.The Draa Abul Naga necropolis is located near the famed Valley of the Kings, where many of the pharaohs, including Tutankhamun, were buried.It is where a separate team of archaeologists found several 3 500 year old mummies and more than 1 000 funerary statues in a discovery announced by the ministry last month.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
