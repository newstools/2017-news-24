Her clothes had been stuffed into the cistern.Calitz told the court that the teen was found with a rope around her body.Bruinders wanted to know whether there was any sign of an object being dragged towards the toilet. This was after it emerged that a witness had allegedly seen the men dragging a body.Bruinders then suggested that an inspection in loco was actually needed because it was confusing to only refer to photos.The court said it was a good idea and granted the request.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
