	     The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality sent a strong warning to parents and guardians to guard their children closely and prevent them from flying kites close to electricity cables as this poses a serious risk of electrocution.  This warning follows a growing number of incidents where kites flown close to or under electric cables have entangled themselves around electric cables, resulting in cables touching each other.  These incidents have led to a number of electricity distribution cuts in a number of areas, especially in the Northern suburbs.  The municipality’s Electricity and Energy Directorate has warned that flying kites near or under electric cables poses a risk because the electric cables are live and carry high electricity voltage, which could cause instantaneous death on contact.  The municipality also appeals to parents to monitor their children closely and keep them from fiddling with electricity installations in their neighbourhoods.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
