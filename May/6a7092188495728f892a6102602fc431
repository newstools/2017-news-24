Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka said last week. "He's supposed to understand he's public property."On Tuesday, a group of leading civil society activists urged Buhari take medical leave, as his absence "has fuelled further speculations and rumours" about the true state of his health. "We are compelled to advise him to heed the advice of his personal physicians by taking a rest to attend to his health without any further delay," they wrote in an open letter. A former chairperson of Buhari's All Progressive Congress party, Bisi Akande, also expressed worries, saying "the health of the leader is intricately intertwined with the health of the nation"."To avoid the ugly consequences of letting President Buhari's ailments throw Nigeria into confusion, I am urging all Nigerians to begin to pray for his divine healing and perfect recovery." The health of Nigeria's president has been a sensitive issue since the death in office in 2010 of Umaru Musa Yar'Adua, which saw months of political turmoil. Buhari dismissed claims during the 2015 presidential election that he was seriously ill with prostate cancer, saying it was an opposition smear designed to show him unfit to be head of state. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
