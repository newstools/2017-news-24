Period. It is seen as an absolute right and a woman's consent is not required," and "I still have to meet a black girl who was not raped at about 12. I am dead serious."Jansen declined to comment about her resignation.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
