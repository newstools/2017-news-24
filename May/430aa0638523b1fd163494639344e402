	     Port Elizabeth - Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso is in South Africa illegally and can be deported because of an illegal work permit, the Port Elizabeth Magistrate’s Court heard on Friday. This was because of the incorrect scanning of his work permit and passport in 2001, immigration officer Ivan Klaasen testified during his bail hearing, Netwerk24 reported. "Therefore, every other work permit is invalid," Klaasen said. Omotoso, of the Jesus Dominion International Church, faces charges of human trafficking and rape. He allegedly lured female members of his churches, which he manages across the country, to Durban and sexually abused them. The Hawks arrested him at Port Elizabeth Airport on April 20. Last week, Klaasen was asked to investigate the validity of Omotoso's passports and work permits. He said Omotoso had six passports. Klaasen only received five passports from Omotoso's advocate. Klaasen said he found the pastor travelled three times with the first passport. Klaasen described Omotoso's visit, relating to the invalid work permit, as a singular entry. This meant the work permit expired immediately after he gained access into the country. "He should've applied for a new permit after each visit, but this did not happen," Klaasen said. The court adjourned for Klaasen to get details of Omotoso's application for his second-last work permit.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
