upgrade her quarters at her own expense after a long battle with the farm
owners she worked for was concluded in the Constitutional Court on Thursday. 

 The unusual case of domestic
worker Yolanda Daniels began in January 2014 when a door was tampered with at
her dwelling on the farm in Blaauwklippen road, and the electricity was cut
off, in what appeared to be an attempt to get her out, according to the
judgment handed down on Thursday. 

 She obtained an interim order
from the Stellenbosch Magistrate’s Court for the restoration of her undisturbed
occupation on the farm and the owners Theo Scribante and Chardonne Properties CC had to fix the door and
put the lights back on. 

 Scribante stopped maintaining
her dwelling after that, so she went back to court. 

 She asked for, and was granted, a declarator that she was
an occupier under the Extension of Security of Tenure Act (ESTA), a law which
guarantees rights of occupation to farm employees. 

 She also got a declarator that
the roof was leaking, the electricity supply was not being kept safe because
there was no maintenance, and that her human dignity was being infringed
because of this. 

 The court ordered that
Scribante repair and maintain the roof and electricity supply, which he did. 

 Then Daniels decided to make a
few improvements to her dwelling. 

 She wrote to Scribante to say
that she was going to do this out of her own pocket. 

 She wanted to level the floors,
pave part of the outside area, and install an indoor water supply, a wash
basin, a second window, and a ceiling. 

 She received no response and
started with the improvements. 

 Then she received a letter from
Scribante telling her to stop the work because she did not have permission to
make the improvements. She was also told that no building plans had been
submitted to them, and that, without plans, the improvements were unlawful. This time Daniels went to court
to obtain an order declaring that she was entitled to make the improvements,
but she was not successful. Instead, she took it on appeal and eventually it
got to the Constitutional Court.  The judges grappled with ESTA,
in the context of South Africa's long history of land dispossession. The ESTA was introduced so that
families who have lived on farms for decades are not evicted overnight if they
lost their jobs. It gives some certainty to people
like Daniels in that there are court processes that need to be followed to
remove employees who live on farms. There were five individual
judgments written for the Daniels v Scribante case, with judges stressing South
Africa's troubled history of black, Indian, and Coloured people being
dispossessed of land and dignity, and white people benefiting and having all
the power.  They said that not looking
after property and making it
uninhabitable could well be a form of evicting people under the radar of the
required court processes. "Of what use is a dwelling if
it is uninhabitable? None.'' remarked
Justice Mbuyiseli Madlanga. Scribante had submitted that
ESTA does not mention an occupier being allowed to make improvements in its
list of the rights and responsibilities of occupants and land owners. But the Constitutional Court
said that although ESTA does not say it specifically, it would be in line with
the purpose of ESTA - which is to protect dignity. The court ruled that Daniels is
entitled to make the following improvements to her dwelling at the farm:Levelling the floors;Paving part of the outside area;Installing water supply inside her dwelling;As well as a wash basin;A second window; andA ceiling.  The parties must agree to times
at which the builders will arrive and leave the farm every day, the movement of
the builders on the farm, and the need for, and approval of building plans. 

 If they cannot agree on this
within 30 days they can approach the Stellenbosch Magistrate's Court for
appropriate relief.  The Trust for Community
