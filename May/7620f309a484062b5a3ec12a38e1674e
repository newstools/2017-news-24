They are equally sophisticated but not more than the state. We have been lenient over time in dealing with them, and very reasonable and now they have terrorised society, and shut down the schools and barred people from going to work," said Mbalula.WATCH: MutshidzI Ligege from #Vuwani expresses his feelings on Pres Zuma's visits pic.twitter.com/kD6yeVqOez&mdash; SA Gov News (@SAgovnews) May 7, 2017WATCH: MutshidzI Ligege from #Vuwani expresses his feelings on Pres Zuma's visits pic.twitter.com/kD6yeVqOez#Vuwani community enjoys music at the stadium as they are waiting for Pres Zuma to address them pic.twitter.com/ynU6goosff&mdash; SA Gov News (@SAgovnews) May 7, 2017#Vuwani community enjoys music at the stadium as they are waiting for Pres Zuma to address them pic.twitter.com/ynU6goosff24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
