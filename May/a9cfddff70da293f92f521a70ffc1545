Government estimates show about eight million Egyptians live in such areas."During the beginning of the previous decade, most street children came from poor villages in the south, but in the last 10 years the slums have expanded exponentially," said Aboulghar.The slums "have been throwing children into the streets where they practise prostitution, theft and begging," she added.Some are saved&nbsp;Civil society organisations such as the Banati Foundation that work with street children face the same difficulties as the government in helping them.In Banati's large shelter, toddlers play in a nursery with toys, paper and paints.They are second- or third-generation street children for whom Banati was able to produce identity papers, thus saving them from the fate that befell their constantly homeless parents."The real problem is that there are entire generations living on the streets," said Aboulghar.Among them are three children of 22-year-old Amira, who has herself been homeless since the age of five."I've got used to this life, and what I've liked most about it is the freedom of no one telling me to do anything, or force me to do anything, and everything is allowed," Amira said.Yet she wishes she had gone to school. "If I'd been educated I would have become a very good person," she said.Amira got married informally, which deprived her children of official birth certificates.But Banati was able to help document her marriage to the children's father, who is now serving a prison term for theft.The documentation made it easer to acquire identification papers for her children, who were then transferred to the shelter where they now live.Banati also offers support to vulnerable young women who can potentially turn to the streets, such as 15-year-old Nesrine.She has been wanting to get married since she was 12 so she can "get out of the house and live away from problems".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
