	     Lilongwe – Police in Malawi have launched a manhunt for unknown criminals who dug up bones of an albino, Stelia Bello, who died in 1984, a report said on Monday. According to Malawi24, the bones were dug up last week on Monday in Byson village, Thyolo district.  The incident came to light after villagers noticed "something unusual" in the graveyard as they were passing by. They alerted the village headman, who immediately went to the graveyard and found out that Bello's grave had been tempered with.  The deceased's sister, Elida Bello, maintained that the body had been exhumed by unknown criminals.  No arrests had been made so far.  The incident occurred just a few months after police arrested a man who was found with human bones of an albino in the capital Lilongwe.    Amnesty International said last year that albinos in Malawi were being targeted in an "unprecedented wave of brutal attacks". The rights group blamed police for failing to tackle a scourge fuelled by ritual practices. At least 18 albinos - who have white skin because of a hereditary condition that causes an absence of pigmentation - have been killed across Malawi since November 2014, the group said at the time.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
