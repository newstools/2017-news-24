The UAE and Egypt are also joint allies of Haftar, whose forces control most of eastern Libya including its key oil ports.On Tuesday, Haftar and Sarraj met in Abu Dhabi for only the second time since the latter was named prime minister in late 2015, as diplomatic efforts intensify to ends years of chaos and conflict in their North African nation.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
