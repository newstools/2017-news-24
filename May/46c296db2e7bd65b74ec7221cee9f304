It is a mixed style of self-defence which teaches one how to protect oneself against unarmed as well armed attackers, Netwerk24 reports.&nbsp; &nbsp;Petra was on her way to work in Johannesburg just before 07:00 on Thursday, when two men approached her in Braamfontein.Disappeared around a cornerOne of the men produced a firearm and threatened to shoot Petra three times, before she hit him &ldquo;four or five times&rdquo;through the open window.The robbers hotfooted it out of there, but she sped to the parade grounds of the metro police to ask for help.The two men were still at the scene when she and the metro cops got there, but disappeared around a corner.&nbsp;The metro police found the firearm where the attackers had dropped it, after which Petra went to the Brixton police station to lay a charge.&nbsp;Petra, who had to stop at a red traffic light, had initially thought the men were beggars.&ldquo;I wound down the window and then heard the man say he was going to shoot me. When I looked down, I saw the gun in his hand.&rdquo;Petra said she&rsquo;d considered leaning forward to pull the knife, which she kept in her car for self-defence, but when the man repeated his threat, she realised it would make her vulnerable.Not traumatised&nbsp;&ldquo;When he said he was going to shoot me for a third time, I leant on the hooter with one hand, while hitting him with my other hand. I can&rsquo;t even remember what his reaction was, but the next thing I saw him walking away.&rdquo;She said her first reaction had been to get out of the car and set off after him, but her seatbelt had prevented her from doing so.&ldquo;I thought tonight buddy, you&rsquo;re going to bleed,&rdquo; Petra said on Sunday.According to her she hasn&rsquo;t been traumatised by the incident at all. Instinct had kicked in.&ldquo;I think I could have hit him harder, but I might at least have prevented someone else from becoming a victim in a similar situation &ndash; and that&rsquo;s important to me.&rdquo;Deon said on Sunday night that the robbers had actually come off lightly and can be glad his wife didn&rsquo;t get hold of them, because her knowledge of martial arts is &ldquo;phenomenal.&ldquo;They would definitely have been badly hurt.&rdquo;Petra, a fourth dan in two styles of karate, has experience in several martial arts, but mostly uses shotokan. She also has a black belt in&nbsp; krav maga, but is just 1.53m tall and says she suspects that the men saw her as an easy target.About three years ago, a man also came off second best after breaking her car&rsquo;s window in the same street and robbed her.Free himself&ldquo;One of my colleagues had phoned and when I answered, the man smashed in the window.&ldquo;As he hit, I dropped the phone, grabbed his hand and yanked him into the car. &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;He hit his chin against the car and I held onto him, while repeatedly hitting him. The guy eventually managed to free himself and ran away. I set off after him in my car, but he escaped by jumping into a taxi,&rdquo; said Petra. &nbsp; Spokesperson Constable Phumi Kraai confirmed that the Brixton police were investigating a case of attempted robbery in connection with Thursday&rsquo;s incident.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
