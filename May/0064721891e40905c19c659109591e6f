They had slowed down at a bend in the road. That&rsquo;s when Mosweu jumped off the bakkie and possibly broke his neck.Warrant Officer Jeremiah Modisane, who took the accused&rsquo;s statements at the Coligny police station and who had been at the scene where Mosweu died, also testified.He said the boy had been lying face down. Blood was coming out of his ears and nose, and his face was also bleeding."He was still alive and was lying in a pool of blood, but died on the way to the clinic," Modisane testified.He also confirmed that the accused had twice previously laid charges of sunflower and maize theft.Magistrate Magaola Faso postponed the bail application to Friday.Before court adjourned, Faso pleaded with those present to stick to the facts when discussing the case."People are allowed to toyi-toyi, as long as it&rsquo;s for the truth," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
