The US command did not acknowledge the charges against Ugandan soldiers, Mudge said in an email. "They say the Ugandans are not engaging in sexual exploitation and abuse."Ugandan soldiers may join the UN peacekeeping mission MINUSCA operating in CAR but HRW said the allegations of sexual abuse should be investigated first.Some MINUSCA soldiers and French troops who were deployed in the strife-torn country between 2013 and 2016 have also been accused of exploiting women and children. However, a Paris prosecutor in March called for the case against soldiers accused of raping children to be dropped.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
