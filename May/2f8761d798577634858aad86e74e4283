We have been restructured to deliver efficiently on the mandate."Despite that, the resources were still limited, relative to other departments.Congress of the People MP Mosiuoa Lekota said the budget was less than&nbsp;the costs of&nbsp;the R246m security upgrades to President Jacob Zuma's Nkandla homestead."How can we expect to make improvements with such a low budget? We must examine ourselves."IFP MP Liesl van der Merwe agreed with Shabangu, saying the party supported the budget because "it is far too small anyway".However, she slammed department officials who took longer than usual trips to conferences in New York, yet when they were back in the country and had to report for constituency duty, they claimed there was limited budget.She criticised the department for remaining in a perpetual state of restructuring.Violence against womenShabangu said the country has seen increased violence against women and children in the last few weeks."These are violent crimes of power and control over women's bodies. No woman or human being deserves this level of cruelty," she said.The mobilisation against violence is not the duty of women alone or men alone, but of everyone.Shabangu said they will be working with the Department of Justice and Correctional Services to combat the scourge of violence against women. Zuma wanted to provide access to economic opportunities for women going forward.It is about accepting the same qualities in women as there are in men, she said.A ministerial task team has been working on a draft policy to ensure sanitary towels can be provided for young and poor women. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
