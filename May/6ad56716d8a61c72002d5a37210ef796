It wanted deductions and debit orders to continue being made from social grant beneficiaries' bank accounts.READ: Sassa still has 50 000 deduction complaints to deal with - DlaminiExploitative practicesThe judgment involved four court cases between Net 1 Applied Technologies (Pty) Ltd against Sassa, the social development department, and others. All four cases were heard on October 17 and 18, 2016.The Black Sash, as an intervening party, had argued that if the court ruled in Net1's favour, the social development minister be given the opportunity to amend the regulations to protect grant beneficiaries from exploitative practices.Van der Westhuizen also ordered that the first three respondents - Magwaza, Sassa, and Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini - pay costs.In a statement released on Thursday, Sassa said the deductions made by Net1's subsidiary CPS were working against government's programme of fighting poverty."Civil society together with the department of Social Development and Sassa have been inundated with beneficiary complaints regarding unauthorised deductions coming off their grants, and the new regulations were intended to cushion the vulnerable against the actions of unscrupulous financial service providers," it said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
