And South Africa gave effect to its international obligations arising from its ratification of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) under Nemba."The minister has to report bi-annually on legislative, regulatory and administrative measures taken to enforce... Cites."The norms and standards is such a measure&hellip; as a result of law, it must be obeyed unless it is set aside."The judge said that different norms and standards applied to different biodiversities and their purpose was to give a flexible application over wide geographic and biodiverse fields, which were vulnerable to quick change.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
