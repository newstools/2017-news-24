"He also reminded them that (the) Nigerian Army is a thorough professional, disciplined, loyal and apolitical institution that has clear constitutional roles and responsibilities."Anyone wanting to get involved in politics should leave the army and any soldier "found to be hobnobbing with such elements or engaged in unprofessional conduct such as politicking would have himself or herself to blame".He added: "The Nigerian Army will remain apolitical and respect the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria."Converted democratNigeria has had six successful military coups since it gained independence from Britain in 1960, leading to decades of army rule that blighted development and fostered large-scale corruption.The current President Muhammadu Buhari is a former army general who ousted the civilian leader in December 1983 and headed a military government for some 20 months.Civilian rule was restored in 1999.Buhari, now 74 and describing himself as a "converted democrat", is currently on medical leave in London for treatment to an undisclosed condition.
