The briefing comes ahead of the ruling party's national policy conference scheduled for June.Turning to racism, Sisulu said it belonged only in history."Racism is what defined the past. Racism is not what is going to define us in the future. What is going to define us in the future is a common identity; a common consciousness of who we are as South Africans to deal with the issue of racism."She said that the sub-committee had previously tried to deal with the issue of racism "and we found the environment not ready..."&hellip; But we believe now that the environment is ready."Sisulu said that the party hoped that a "mind shift" could take place."We have to move away from any exclusionary practices that discriminate one group from another in any form," said Sisulu."We feel now we have reached a point where we can deal with the issue of racism as a society and eliminate all of these stubborn stains." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
