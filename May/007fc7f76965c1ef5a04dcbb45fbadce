Amongst others, he cited the interests of the company, good corporate governance and the interest of the public, as underlying his departure from the utility," the party said.'Angered by actions of our deployees'Molefe returns to Eskom following a short stint as a Member of Parliament.At the time of his controversial move to Parliament, condemned by alliance partners SACP and Cosatu, there was speculation that President Jacob Zuma wanted to appoint him as finance minister.However, during his April late night reshuffle, he appointed Malusi Gigaba instead, after the SACP and some in the top six voiced their disapproval of Molefe.Last week, party policy expert Joel&nbsp;Netshitenzhe&nbsp; told delegates at the ANC Northern Cape elective conference that the return of Molefe signalled that the party had lost control of its deployees."We are angered by actions of our deployees which demonstrate the vanguard has lost its DNA, its capacity to lead, let alone society, even to lead its own deployees," Netshitenzhe said to loud applause.WATCH:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
