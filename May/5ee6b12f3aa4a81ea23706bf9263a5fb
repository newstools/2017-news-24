"Only the House [the National Assembly] can establish such a committee," he said.Mbete said: "I believe it is desirable to have a commission of inquiry into state capture in its broad sense."She said there will be a "structure that will probe into whatever you understand into state capture"."We will all sleep better when we know some people are dealing with this monster."AS IT HAPPENED: ANC NEC called for a judicial inquiry into state captureNEC resolutionIt seemed that what Mbete and Tsenoli had in mind was more in line with a resolution that the ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) accepted.At the same time of Mbete's press briefing, ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe addressed the media in Luthuli House on the past weekend's NEC meeting."The NEC accepted the proposal that was tabled in the Political Report for the establishment of a judicial commission of enquiry into allegations of state capture without delay" reads Mantashe's statement."The terms of reference of such commission of enquiry must be broad enough to uncover the influence of business on the state. The NEC expressed its desire to see all processes of reviewing the Public Protector's&nbsp;State of Capture&nbsp;report accelerated so that they are not an obstacle to the speedy establishment of the judicial commission into state capture.""Of course, that would be absolutely helpful," said Tsenoli. "Any inquiry into state capture would be absolutely welcome."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
