It would provide a platform for victims' families who did not have the ability to voice their opinion in the journey to justice.The family thanked investigating officer Marlon Marais and prosecutor Christopher Burke for their efforts."He [Marais] has been unbelievable the last 18 months. He put down two promotions to see this through and yet smiles every time after 18 hours of work."Henry and Jacobs had followed the Uber taxi that Schoombie and his three friends were travelling home in after a night out.They blocked the taxi in a cul-de-sac to target Schoombie, accusing him without basis of starting trouble at the Tiger Tiger nightclub in Claremont.Schoombie was admitted to hospital in a coma and died a few days later."Although not planned or premeditated, their conduct was brazen and revolting and would have produced a sense of shock in any normal human being," said Henney.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
