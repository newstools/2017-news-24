The 27-year-old man arrived home in Thokgoaneng village, in Ga-Chuene, around 05:00 to find his girlfriend in bed with the man, Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said. He then allegedly set the house on fire. The man and woman managed to escape, but sustained serious burn wounds. They were receiving treatment at a local hospital. The man handed himself to police and would appear in the Thabamoopo Magistrate’s Court in Lebowakgomo on charges of attempted murder and arson. “The SAPS would like to make an appeal to all members of the communities to refrain from resorting to violent conduct whenever they are experiencing domestic-related problems, but rather report to the local authorities for professional advice and amicable interventions,” Ngoepe said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
