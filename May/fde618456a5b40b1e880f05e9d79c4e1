This is something very worrying."Kahn said she did not think the school was promoting such behaviour."But we need to find ways of the school educating and discouraging all forms of hatred, be it racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia and all forms of hatred, particularly in the schooling system." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
