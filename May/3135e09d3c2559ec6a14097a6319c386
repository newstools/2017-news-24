The court of cassation would have to issue a final ruling in such an appeal.Badie is being prosecuted in more than 35 trials, according to his lawyers. He received three death sentences in other cases but those rulings have also been scrapped.The court of cassation has cancelled scores of death sentences against Morsi supporters including against the deposed president himself.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
