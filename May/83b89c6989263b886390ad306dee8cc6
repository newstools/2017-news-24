At the moment we are all focusing on mobilising support for our party. So far we are happy with what we are doing&hellip;," the MDC Secretary General Douglas Mwonzora was quoted as saying in a New Zimbabwe report.&nbsp;Meanwhile, the former finance minister Tendai Biti led party, the People Democratic Party (PDP), questioned the method that was used to come up with the survey.&nbsp;PDP spokesperson Jacob Mafume said that although his party recognised the Afrobarometer as a reputable organisation, he was not sure which scientific method was used to come up with the results.&nbsp;"Surveys are scientific by nature. I cannot say much without knowing how the survey was conducted, for example the nature of the questions which were asked to the respondents," said Mafume.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
