Many viewers expressed shock and horror at the officials&rsquo; behaviour and strongly condemned it.&nbsp;Theewaterskloof municipality mayor Christelle Vosloo said she had seen the video and was upset by the actions of the officials.&nbsp;She has undertaken to comment as quickly as possible on what steps the municipality will take against the officials.&nbsp;Vosloo said: "I noted the video footage showing people, dressed in the uniforms of law enforcers, throwing apples at the victims. I regard the conduct of the attackers as inhumane and a gross violation of the safety and dignity of their victims."I am devastated that the victims had to endure this trauma and I believe their constitutional rights, not to be exposed to psychological, emotional and physical abuse had been violated.&nbsp;I will ensure an immediate investigation into the incident. "If any personnel of the municipality are found guilty in regards to the incident they will face the strongest disciplinary actions possible. &nbsp;I call on the community to give me and the municipality an opportunity to investigate the incident and to deal with it appropriately.&nbsp;I will keep them informed on an on-going basis." She said she would&nbsp;meet with the victims and ensure that they receive "all the support available to deal with the trauma they suffered". &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
