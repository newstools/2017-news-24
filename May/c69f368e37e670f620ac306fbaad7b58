She would never do it."&nbsp;The body of the 29-year-old was discovered in her locked office on Monday after 16:00 when Eskom employees got a whiff of a strong smell emanating from the corridors of the substation where she worked.She was reported missing on May 17.&nbsp;Mboneni Yende said the family was not coping with the death and was disappointed with the manner in which Eskom handled the situation.&nbsp;"When we started searching for her, we received no help from Eskom. Until now we never received any form of support from Eskom. The company did not even pay us a visit yet," he said.&nbsp;When asked why no one in the offices picked up that the door remained locked for that long, Eskom national spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said: "It is a remote site with small offices"."It is outside Springs. It is not like your normal offices, you don&rsquo;t have people coming in and out there every day."When she arrived, the closed circuit camera picked her up, but a few moments later the system didn&rsquo;t pick up any movement, he said.Phasiwe told News24 that on the day she was reported missing, police came and searched the offices.
