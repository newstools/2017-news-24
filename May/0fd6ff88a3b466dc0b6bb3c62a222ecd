Mbotho has denied this.Take overSome linked to Friday's massive clampdown described it as a show of force.This after the new underworld faction had gone into the city centre several times, making their way into various clubs, apparently to take over security.On April 21 News24 had witnessed how the new underworld faction had gone to some clubs.Armed men had been stationed outside the doors of establishments they had gone to.Police had seized firearms and ammunition from them outside a strip club.But these were returned to the group after they obtained a court order to get the weapons and ammunition back.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
