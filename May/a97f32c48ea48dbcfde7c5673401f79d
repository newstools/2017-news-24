President Jacob Zuma had proclaimed three investigations in the department.In the 2015/2016 financial year, the SIU's anti-fraud and corruption investigations cost the department R79m, and the figure rose to R149m in 2016/2017.The committee was generally impressed with the department's work in turning things around."I think we're moving in the right direction with this department," said committee chairperson Freddie Adams.Cronin was also questioned about the expenditure on state events, like inaugurations and state funerals.UDM MP Mncebisi Filtane, who enjoys a joke, asked whether they planned for state funerals.Cronin said it was actually a good question, because there were things - like state funerals - that they could not plan for, unlike inaugurations.Then he added: "There might be an earlier inauguration this time around..." &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
