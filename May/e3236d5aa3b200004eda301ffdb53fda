"They were arrested and threatened and then some people pretended to lapidate them.""There was no lapidation," he added. "People went to see but there was no stoning."A Malian security source confirmed the report, saying the execution by stoning had been cancelled.Last week, the Group to Support Islam and Muslims (GSIM), a fusion of several jihadist groups with previous Al-Qaeda links, issued a statement denying any involvement in the stoning and questioning whether it ever took place.Jihadists seized key northern cities in Mali in March 2012, and though they were driven out the next year, Islamist groups continue to make their presence felt with frequent attacks on domestic and foreign forces.During their brief control of key towns in the vast north, jihadist groups imposed a version of Sharia law which forced women to wear veils and set whipping and stoning as punishment for transgressions.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
