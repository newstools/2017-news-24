He shouldn't be taken seriously," tweeted Obert Gutu, the spokesperson for Morgan Tsvangirai's MDC party."Which Zimbabwe is #Mugabe talking about at #WEFAfrica2017 ??? Definitely not the one l live in right now," said TV producer Munya Bloggo on Twitter.Commented @dudumo: "Biggest joke."But others felt that Mugabe had a point. Journalist Sharon Tawuya said: "I have been to over 15 African countries and I say #Zim stays in the top 10. Mr President is right this time around.".@cemambo from state broadcaster ZBC started a quick survey, asking Zimbabweans to rank their country in terms of development compared to other African countries.Said Mambo: "I have unfortunately only been to 11 of the 54 African countries. And of those 11, l rate #Zim in the top four."Online press watchdog @ZimMediaReview said: "Some say Zimbos need to travel more in Africa to see that Mugabe's right; Zim is more developed than many African countries. Most disagree."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
