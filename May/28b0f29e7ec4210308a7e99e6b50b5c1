At least, when I am still here and Minister of Police I will not allow this nonsense," he told reporters.Mbalula maintained that he was merely enforcing the law.In March, the court found that then police minister Nathi Nhleko had ignored two court judgments, which found that Ntlemeza lacked integrity and honesty, when he appointed him head of the elite police unit.The court found that the findings in both judgments constituted "direct evidence" that Ntlemeza lacked the requisite honesty, integrity, and conscientiousness to hold public office. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
