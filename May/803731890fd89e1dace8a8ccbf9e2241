Then things got a bit physical when they tried to remove Mr Maimane from the plane. When Mr Maimane tried to reach for his phone, his phone was confiscated by the legal authorities.&rdquo;Charters said there was a stalemate between Maimane and authorities for about half an hour, while Maimane demanded to know why he was not allowed into the country. &nbsp;&ldquo;He was then ordered to take the next flight back to South Africa.&rdquo;Charters said the authorities did not give any reason for the ill-treatment &ldquo;and the blocking of a constitutional office bearer, of a fellow African state".&ldquo;At a time where Africa needs to be moving towards a maturing democracy, and upholding the values of the rule of law, we can see that many of our African brothers and sisters are still subject to the regime of big-man politics,&rdquo; Charters said as the incident happened and the country celebrated Africa Day. &nbsp;&ldquo;He was not harmed but he was certainly shaken. There was a scuffle to get his phone but he was not physically harmed.&rdquo;Charters said Maimane had been deported back to South Africa and has landed.&ldquo;We call on the South African government to take immediate action against such apartheid like actions by the Zambian government,&rdquo; he said.Maimane could not be reached for comment.Democracy is something we all should fight for in our continent.
