Kaveel Singh, News24Durban - KwaZulu-Natal pupils who&nbsp;protested on Tuesday&nbsp;against the abduction of children have false information, a government official said on Tuesday. "It is not true that foreign nationals are behind the kidnapping and abductions of children. That is not the information we have," director for the KwaZulu-Natal department of community safety and liaison Simphiwe Mbhele said.According to Mbhele, incorrect information spread through social media resulting in attacks in the area. He was speaking at&nbsp;the protest in KwaMashu where youngsters from various schools gathered and marched through the area. The protest ended peacefully after the large group dispersed just outside Bridge City Mall.Police appear to be attempting to calm the crowd @News24 pic.twitter.com/bhdsXN1j2y"These are criminals not foreign nationals. We need to correct this. It cannot be that we have children on the street like this and not in school," Mbhele said.Mbhele said that government was intervening in the situation."We are here on an ongoing basis."There were violent xenophobic attacks overnight in KwaMashu. Police have not yet made any arrests.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
