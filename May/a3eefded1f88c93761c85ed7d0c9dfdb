The group was formed for use when women find themselves in an emergency situation. Another 13 similar WhatsApp groups have also been started. Beebee encouraged women students to send a message to the WhatsApp group if they felt unsafe or realised they were being followed."It is a fast and easy way to contact several people at the same time, rather than send individual messages to people," Beebee said.Members of the university's student representative council (SRC) and house committees helped convey the message, and invited students to join the WhatsApp group."The most recent incidents on and around campus have shaken me. I've known Hannah since we were at school and I'm struggling to process her death," she said.Photos of emergency numbers, links to self-defence websites, and advice on using pepper spray are also being shared on the WhatsApp groups.Beebee said women on the groups could, in numbers, fight against "hatred, evil and awful deeds of violence" and had to do their best to support one another.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
