EU ambassador Michael Ryan described the measure as "too limiting".Rwanda opposition figures have also criticised the move saying it will be used to block any criticism of President Paul Kagame who has been in charge of the country since 1994 and is running for a third term after changing the constitution to permit his candidacy. Four opposition candidates are hoping to run against Kagame, if they are granted approval by the election commission.While the constitution enshrines a multiparty system, there is virtually no opposition in the country, with the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) exerting total control over the political, social and economic spheres.Since the end of the genocide, which killed around 800 000 people mostly from the Tutsi ethnic group in 1994, Rwanda has been praised for its economic performance and stability but criticised for its attacks and limitations on freedom of expression.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
