That's partly due to a downturn in industrial demand inside Zimbabwe. Power-shedding was a daily reality during Zimbabwe's last economic crisis up to early 2009.Online watchdog @ZimMediaReview noted grimly that the load-shedding warnings come "just in time for winter."And a Herald reader suggested the authorities "print more useless bond notes and ship them to South Africa and see if ESKOM will accept them as payment!" in a reference to the special-to-Zimbabwe bank notes introduced late last year. The bond notes have failed to solve Zimbabwe's cash shortages.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
