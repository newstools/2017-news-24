The violence tormenting the country had to end, Prof Jan Crafford said during a graduation ceremony at the university, in Thohoyandou, Limpopo. Education should help emancipate the country from poverty and violence. He said the graduation was taking place during a year the ANC had dedicated to its former leader, OR Tambo. He loved education and taught others because he wanted to end poverty and ensure economic growth, Crafford said. “Sadly, the youth globally are failing to change the world for better. Poverty, inequality, prejudice , intolerance, violence against women and children have not changed. In fact, it has become worse.” He told graduates to help change society with the education they received. More than 2 000 people graduated from the university over the last two days, 61% of them were women and 39% men. He warned them not to depend on finding work, but to create it. Enterprise and small business development were ways to increase economic growth, he said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
