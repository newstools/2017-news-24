They have already ruled out two possible sightings of their child, with the help of CCTV footage provided by police.She was last seen at the corner of Milky Way and Grand Vue Drive wearing a yellow and white top and blue shorts.Pieters said she was very worried about her daughter, and battled to sleep, but counselling was helping her get through each day. On Saturday, their neighbours are planning to form a big search group to walk through the area yet again to see if they can find any clues that will lead them to the child. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
