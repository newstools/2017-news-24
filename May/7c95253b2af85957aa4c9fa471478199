The foundations of Desmond and Leah Tutu, Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe, Chief Albert Luthuli and Helen Suzman will also participate in the kick-off of the national dialogues on Friday. The foundations told News24 that the dialogues will discuss the threats to South Africa's young democracy. De Klerk, Mbeki, Motlanthe and Mlambo-Ngcuka will address the national dialogue to "provide a safe non-partisan platform to South Africans of all races to confront the crisis in political governance, the toxic political environment and state of the economy". CEO of the Thabo Mbeki Foundation, Max Boqwana, said the national dialogue is not an attempt by former presidents to "govern from the grave". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
