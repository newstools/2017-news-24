He also argued in court documents that the norms and standards were &ldquo;irrational and unreasonable&rdquo; and for that reason had to be declared null and void.The government, in turn, pointed out that it was a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora&nbsp; (CITES) and may for that reason not agree to permits being issued for the export of African elephants to a zoo.Pillay pointed out that elephants being confined is a problem for the government and the norms and standards were introduced to regulate the industry.&nbsp;"In terms of the norms and standard the African elephant is considered an indigenous, endangered species and for that reason it deserves national conservation status," Pillay said.Boswell&rsquo;s application was rejected with costs.Boswell said he didn&rsquo;t know what to do with the elephants now and claimed it cost him a substantial amount to maintain them. "I will, however, not be able to have them put down," he said.He said they had been with him for 35 years and activists should shoulder the blame that they can no longer be used in his circus. "I will have to find another way out [of the situation]."He hasn&rsquo;t decided yet if he should appeal against the ruling.&nbsp;&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
