Tunisia is a country several thousand years old, with a deep-rooted history of openness to all religions," he told AFP.Secondly, he said, "security has come back to Tunisia".Rocked by instability since the fall in 2011 of longtime dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia was hit by a series of jihadist attacks in 2015 and 2016 that left dozens dead, including 59 tourists. The country's key tourism sector, devastated by the attacks, has since registered a rise in visitor numbers.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
