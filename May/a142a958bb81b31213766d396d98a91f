The rebels support the president, while the majority of the party rejected his choice.An alternative majority could be drawn from the 41 MPs of the Social Renewal Party (PRS) along with these 15 rebels.The UN Security Council on May 11 urged Vaz to appoint a prime minister who enjoys broad political support.Council members said the crisis was "as a result of the inability of political stakeholders to reach a lasting and consensual solution, leading to the current gridlock".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
