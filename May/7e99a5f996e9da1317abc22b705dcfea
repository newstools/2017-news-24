Set up in 2014, the operation comprises around 4 000 soldiers who are deployed across five countries - Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Chad and Burkina Faso.In Niger, it operates four Mirage 2000 fighter jets and five Reaper drones for gathering intelligence. Mali's north fell under the control of jihadist groups linked to Al-Qaeda in 2012 who hijacked an ethnic Tuareg-led rebel uprising, though the Islamists were largely ousted by a French-led military operation in January 2013.But jihadists continue to roam the country's north and centre, mounting attacks on civilians and the army, as well as French and UN forces still stationed there.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
