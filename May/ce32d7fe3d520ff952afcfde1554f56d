Investing in infrastructure, education and health, Macron said, all of which have suffered badly from the Malian state's near absence in large swathes of its northern territory, was the "best antidote" to jihad.To that end, France promised "constant" military, diplomatic and political support with the help of the French Development Agency (AFD), he said.Macron's predecessor Francois Hollande said in January that France would boost the AFD's budget for Africa by 15% over the coming years to $25.7bn.Macron is travelling with Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who as the former defence minister knows Gao well, and his replacement in that job, Sylvie Goulard, as well as AFD chief Remy Rioux.The French president said he would also attend a meeting of the G5 Sahel countries, the same nations where the Barkhane force has a presence, in the coming weeks.&nbsp;New approach?&nbsp;Seventeen French soldiers have died serving in Mali since 2013 when Hollande launched an intervention to chase out jihadists linked with Al-Qaeda who had overtaken key northern cities.Jihadists continue to roam the country's north and centre, mounting attacks on civilians and the army, as well as French and UN forces still stationed there.Macron emphasised the need for closer European cooperation in the fight against jihadists, especially with fellow EU heavyweight Germany."My desire in the framework of our military involvement in Africa is to do even more with Europe, more with Germany, but in a pragmatic manner," Macron told journalists.Germany currently contributes 550 troops to the multi-national UN force in Mali, called MINUSMA, forming the largest European contingent.The new president discussed the issue with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Monday during his first visit to a foreign leader since taking power.Stationed in Mali since July 2013, MINUSMA has just over 12 000 military and police personnel working on what is considered the UN's most dangerous active peacekeeping deployment.France wants a "new Franco-German impetus so that Europe plays a greater role in defence and security matters, especially in Africa and the Sahel," a source in Macron's team said.During his campaign, Macron spoke of his desire to re-calibrate France's role on the African continent.He was criticised at home for describing France's colonial war in Algeria as a "crime against humanity" and "genuinely barbaric".The comments were well-received in Algeria and other former colonies but condemned by Macron's far-right rival in the presidential vote, Marine Le Pen.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
