Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza had predicted two to three years.She said Sassa currently did not have the expertise to manage the grants scheme on its own, and that South Africans should look at the sum as a long-term investment.The current contract with outgoing service provider Cash Paymaster Services, which ends in March 2018, is currently worth a third of that, around R2bn a year.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
