The service would help alleviate traffic congestion in the southern parts of the city, he said.On February 10, the Western Cape High Court ruled in favour of the City of Cape Town and cleared it of any wrongdoing in how it went about implementing the project.People living in South Road, Wynberg, received notices to vacate city-owned rental properties in September 2014 to make way for a MyCiti bus expansion.The SRFA subsequently obtained an interdict preventing the city from moving forward with the project.Association chairperson Clive Muller said the city never held public participation sessions, but merely &ldquo;information sessions&rdquo;, and only when residents asked for them.The city said plans had not yet been finalised on whether the bus route would go through South Road.Herron said they were eager to finalise the route alignment of the Wynberg section of Phase 2A of the bus service.&ldquo;This court action was a waste of our ratepayers&rsquo; money and has unfairly and unnecessarily delayed the much-needed roll-out of the MyCiTi service to the residents of Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha by nearly two years.&rdquo;He said phase 2A of the MyCiTi bus service would change the lives of hundreds of thousands of poor residents for the better.Once fully rolled out, the proposed Phase 2A of the MyCiTi service would benefit approximately 1.4 million residents, from the outskirts of Khayelitsha and Mitchells Plain to the urban centres of Wynberg and Claremont. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
