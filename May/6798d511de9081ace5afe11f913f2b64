Learning at Yomelela Primary School in Khayelitsha has suffered a major setback following a fire that destroyed the storeroom including text books kept ther. After the long weekend, staff arrived on Tuesday to discover that their administration block was destroyed. Deputy Principal Sibongiseni Dlaku said: “I received a call from the caretaker alerting me to the fire. When I arrived at the school, I found that the adminstration room and the book store had caught fire. The damage has been extensive as none of the books stored the escaped the fire. “Even the printers were not saved,” he said. He said that the fire also damaged the workbooks for the 3rd and 4th semester and other learning material. “This will seriously set us back as a school as we have to find a way to get the workbooks. We also kept printing paper donated by parents there, including other stationery,” he added. Dlaku said the cause of the fire was yet to be established but learning was continuing. “We are appealing to parents to be understanding and be patient as we are battling to recover from this incident,” he said. He added that this set back has put more pressure on the already struggling school to raise funds for the school programmes. “We had already planned to have a Mother’s Day event to raise badly needed funds, now this will put us under more. We are, however working towards sorting it out despite it being a devastating setback.”
