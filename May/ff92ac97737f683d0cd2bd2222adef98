He said this was reminiscent of similar conduct by the same policemen, who arrested Advocate Gerrie Nel and others "to protect their masters".IPID said they will not stop their investigations as the allegations are serious and they have so far found merit in them. IPID said they would safeguard their independence and is committed to investigating without fear, favour or prejudice.Spokesperson for the police minister Vuyo Mhaga said Minister Fikile Mbalula would not necessarily be aware of a planned raid on IPID&rsquo;s offices.&ldquo;This standoff between the police and IPID, the Minister cannot really be seen as getting involved. He cannot interfere on matters between units,&rdquo; Mhaga said. &nbsp; &nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
