Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown had objected to Eskom&rsquo;s proposal that he get a R30m pension payout. He resigned from the parastatal in November 2016.- Follow the Live Update&nbsp;here.The EFF claimed Molefe had hoped he would be appointed a minister in President Jacob Zuma's recent Cabinet reshuffle, and that he resigned from Eskom following allegations against him contained in former public protector Thuli Madonsela's State of Capture report.He could not return to his old job without due process being followed, the EFF said. Eskom should advertise the job again and shortlist and interview candidates."Only in a banana republic can a person resign from a state-owned enterprise as CEO based on strong allegations against them, then become a public representative, and when they are not appointed to cabinet, then returns to his CEO job."The EFF said it was consulting its lawyers about the decision."The ANC always said people are trying to co-govern with them through the courts. This is caused by such mad decisions which render us as a country into a mockery and a banana republic. The EFF will not allow that and will fight to the end to return the rule of law in our country against all manner of kleptocracy in our government."Earlier, the ANC said Eskom's decision to reinstate Molefe was "unfortunate and reckless".&nbsp;- Read more:&nbsp;ANC condemns 'reckless' Molefe reinstatementEFF condemns reappointment of Molefe as Eskom CEO as an illegal move based on advancing personal interests of a Gupta stooge. #BrianMolefe&mdash; EFF Official Account (@EFFSouthAfrica) May 12, 2017EFF condemns reappointment of Molefe as Eskom CEO as an illegal move based on advancing personal interests of a Gupta stooge. #BrianMolefe24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
