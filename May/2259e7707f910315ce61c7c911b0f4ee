He then returned to France where he became a citizen.Breytenbach has published some 50 books, including The True Confession of an Albino Terrorist and numerous volumes of poetry, written mainly in his native Afrikaans.Breytenbach read his poetry at the Warsaw ceremony and also spoke of his affinity with Zbigniew Herbert's work.Nominated for the Nobel Literature Prize in 1991, Herbert was a potent symbol of Poland's struggle for national independence against the oppressive intentions of its neighbours to the east and west. He died in 1998. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
