The fighting has blocked aid in some regions, and the government has been accused by aid groups of restricting access. Officials deny it."Humanitarian access is still likely to remain volatile throughout the outlook period in many areas," the new report warns, citing the spread of conflict since fighting erupted anew in the capital, Juba, in July."Families have hit a tipping point, and without sustained humanitarian assistance hundreds of thousands of children are at risk of death," James Elder, a spokesman for the UN children's agency, told The Associated Press on Sunday.On Wednesday, a UN base in Leer county came under attack from the direction of the government-held town, according to the UN. There were no deaths, but aid has been limited as a result of the fighting."The people are hungry and deprived as the result of the famine. However, it is clear the attackers have no consideration for their plight, given those who most desperately need help will suffer more because of a likely resulting delay of humanitarian aid," David Shearer, head of the UN mission in South Sudan, said in a statement.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
