"Wherever innocent blood is spilled, a wound is inflicted upon humanity. But this attack also steels our resolve to bring nations together for the righteous purpose of crushing the evil organizations of terror, and exposing their depraved, twisted and thuggish ideology.Sisi said Egyptian forces had hit a jihadist training camp in an undisclosed location in retaliation for the attack on the Christians' bus. Egyptian state television reported that the air force struck training camps in neighboring Libya.Christians have been targeted by Islamist militants across the Middle East in recent years, forcing thousands to flee a region which has been home to some of the oldest Christian communities in the world.Trump said the United States "makes clear to its friends, allies and partners that the treasured and historic Christian Communities of the Middle East must be defended and protected. "Civilization is at a precipice - and whether we climb or fall will be decided by our ability to join together to protect all faiths, all religions, and all innocent life. No matter what, America will do what it must to protect its people."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
