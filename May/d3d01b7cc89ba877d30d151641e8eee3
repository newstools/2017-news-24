He referred to tweets in which Zille referred to "professional blacks" and "refugees"."They [the ANC] twist any normal word to a racist connotation because they are failing in government," Zille countered."Keep quiet and listen," ANC MPL Richard Dyantyi snarled at her.Deputy speaker Piet Pretorius ruled in Zille's favour both times.Zille did not deliver a speech during the debate.'Cooking the books'DA speakers like MECs Bonginkosi Madikizela, Ivan Meyer and Alan Winde all sang from the same hymn sheet.They referred to documents by bodies like the Presidency and the Auditor General in which the province's governance was lauded, and compared it to what they called the ANC's failures.They argued that good governance meant they were transforming the province, and that the ANC was being racially divisive to hide Zuma's failings."We have radically transformed this province," boasted Meyer.During his speech he waved books titled Zuma Exposed and When Zuma Goes."This debate actually exposed Mr Zuma. It's exposing the hypocrisy of your leader," said Meyer.When Dyantyi heckled him, Meyer yelled back: "You were one of the MECs that were cooking the books."Pretorius had to call "order" at least three times before Meyer quieted down. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
