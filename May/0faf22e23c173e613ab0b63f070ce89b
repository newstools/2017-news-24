"It was almost like torture."A pathologist who examined Schoombie's body said he had a brain injury usually only seen in people killed in car accidents.Schoombie was admitted to hospital in a coma and died a few days later.The court found the men&rsquo;s personal circumstances were not substantial and compelling enough to deviate from the prescribed minimum sentence of life imprisonment for the murder.Henry was a first-time offender, a father of three school-going children and had a record of steady employment.Jacobs was married, had previous convictions, financially supported his three children and played an active role in their lives. His lawyer had argued that he should be considered a first-time offender because his previous convictions were a long time ago. He had also argued that his HIV status was a mitigating factor.The court found it was not a mitigating factor because, while life-threatening, it was not fatal and could successfully be treated with medication.Henney said Schoombie would have been a great asset to society."The Schoombie family will take a long time to recover from the loss of their loved one, if ever."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
