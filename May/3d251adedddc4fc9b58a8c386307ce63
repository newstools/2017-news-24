He said, in the past Africans were visitors in the cities, so initiations only took place in rural areas.As democracy came, so urbanisation increased. Initiations began to be performed in urban areas, away from the vigilant gaze of traditional councils. Hence a need to regulate initiation schools.Bapela said the bill would empower the police to make arrests, and the NPA to prosecute "illegal schools found in cities where traditional leaders are not in control of people".The bill would also empower municipalities to make bylaws to regulate the initiation schools. Municipalities would also have to create inspectorates to monitor the schools, which would have to register with the municipalities.Furthermore, the bill would also provide a curriculum for the schools. Bapela said many young people only went through initiation because of peer pressure."We must ensure there is a curriculum to ensure that, when children go there, they come out better people," Bapela said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
