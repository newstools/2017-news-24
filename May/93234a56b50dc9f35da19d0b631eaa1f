Based on the reaction received from our members and comments by legal and media experts, we fully agree that clarity is needed from the Press Council&rsquo;s highest adjudication body &ndash; the Appeals Panel &ndash; on this important matter," Sanef said.As the largest organisation representing editors from South Africa&rsquo;s national, local and community media titles, Sanef said it believed that such clarity would guide "our" reportage on opinions that may offend or discriminate in the future. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
