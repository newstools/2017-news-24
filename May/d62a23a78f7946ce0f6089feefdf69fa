We know when he speaks fast, he stutters. He speaks slowly. We hugged and cried," he told Judge Siraj Desai.He agreed that this was in contrast to the testimony of Dr Michelle van Zyl who later examined him and described Henri as calm.Henri, 22 is on trial on charges of murdering his parents Martin, 54, and Teresa, 55, and brother Rudi, 22, with an axe, attempting to murder his younger sister Marli, and defeating the ends of justice.He has pleaded not guilty, claiming a balaclava-clad man attacked the family in their home in the De Zalze Estate, Stellenbosch, in the early hours of January 27, 2015, before escaping.Broke downThe Du Toits are the Van Breda family&rsquo;s only relatives in the province, and&nbsp;Du Toit&nbsp;has been attending proceedings regularly.He said on the morning of the murders, he was contacted by the estate manager to go to De Zalze as quickly as possible.When he arrived, he found a number of police vehicles outside 12 Goske Street.The property was surrounded by yellow police tape.Du Toit broke down when he told the court that he found out at the scene that Teresa, Martin and their son Rudi had died.Station commander Colonel Damon Beneke introduced himself to him while he stood outside the house, and the first question he was asked was what the family&rsquo;s relationship was like, Du Toit testified.&ldquo;I replied that I don't know of any problems,&rdquo; he recalled.He later heard that Henri had been taken to the police station and Marli to the Stellenbosch Mediclinic.He and his wife, who later joined him, were not allowed to see Marli at the hospital and were told that she was being transferred to Vergelegen Mediclinic."[At the hospital they told me] there were better doctors for her there and they didn't want us to see her in that condition," Du Toit said.They then went to the Stellenbosch police station and asked to see Henri. They weren&rsquo;t allowed to and apparently weren&rsquo;t given a reason for this.They didn&rsquo;t give Henri any food or clothes, he said.
