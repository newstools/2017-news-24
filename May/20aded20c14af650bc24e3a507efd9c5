Members of the community, including a large group of pupils protested outside court while police kept a close watch. The pair allegedly caught Moshoeu, 16, stealing sunflowers on April 20. They claimed they were driving him to the local police station when he allegedly jumped off their bakkie and broke his neck.An eyewitness alleges he was pushed off. Some residents claimed he was killed because he was black, which apparently sparked the protests in the area.Prosecutor Khetheni Mudau said when the men handed themselves to police on April 25, the protests stopped &ndash; which was an indication that the protests were not related to service delivery.The men's lawyer, PJ Smith, told the court they believed the allegations made by the State's witness did not corroborate a statement he made to a police officer, Brigadier Clifford Matome Kgorane.Smith argued that the court should consider that the accused handed themselves over to police.Moshoeu, whose name means "Sorrow", was buried at the Scotland informal settlement in Coligny on Sunday.#Coligny residents unhappy with bail being granted @News24 pic.twitter.com/DrC5jaJdso&mdash; Jeanette Chabalala (@J_chabalala) May 8, 2017#Coligny residents unhappy with bail being granted @News24 pic.twitter.com/DrC5jaJdsoHere are the 2 men arrested in connection with the murder of 16-year-old #Coligny boy @News24 pic.twitter.com/3o1tcFcjOA&mdash; Jeanette Chabalala (@J_chabalala) May 8, 2017Here are the 2 men arrested in connection with the murder of 16-year-old #Coligny boy @News24 pic.twitter.com/3o1tcFcjOA24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
