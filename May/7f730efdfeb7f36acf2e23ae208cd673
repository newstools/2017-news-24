Should further action be required, this will be done in line with good governance practices."The provincial government has extensive procurement monitoring systems in place," Zille's office said."This has enabled every provincial department, including Human Settlements, to obtain a clean financial audit."Provincial government systems exclude politicians from processes relating to the awarding of contracts."&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
