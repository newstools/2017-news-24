Humanitarian agencies have called it impossible to retrieve corpses from the streets because of the ongoing insecurity.The UN mission noted that "deliberate attacks in Bangassou, with heavy weaponry, seem to be well-planned as the perpetrators made access very difficult by destroying bridges and blocking all accessible roads to town," said Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for the UN secretary-general.Humanitarian agencies indicated more than 7 200 people fled Bangassou after the weekend fighting sparked by the anti-Balaka attack. An unknown number of people fled toward the border with Democratic Republic of Congo.Meanwhile, the UN said unconfirmed reports suggest up to 100 were killed in attacks in the town of Alindao. Some 8 500 people have been displaced by violence there, Dujarric said.These areas of Central African Republic did not experience major violence during the sectarian bloodshed that erupted in late 2013 and ultimately forced nearly all of the Muslims in the capital, Bangui, to flee to the country's north and beyond to neighbouring Chad.Fighting has mounted, however, and last month Doctors Without Borders warned of "levels of violence that have not been seen since the peak of the conflict in 2014."Zeid, the UN human rights chief, said the death toll prior to the attacks on Alindao and Bangassou already was at least 121 since March.In Bangui, dozens of people held a demonstration against the violence in the southeast. Prime Minister Simplice Mathieu Sarandji assured those protesting that the government would punish those responsible."There are widows and orphans in front of us today," he said. "These people only want one thing: that justice is done." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
