They tell others how the basket should be made."For example, for its free sanitary towel programme, it does not buy and distribute the sanitary towels.Sanitary towels programmeIt develops the policy that will support the programme which will keep female children in school when they menstruate instead of staying home on those days.However, the committee was not pleased with the department's performance.It expressed concern over an apparent dearth of interaction with other departments to discuss important gender issues, little or no input on gender aspects of legislation being drawn up, and outdated policies.It was lambasted for not joining the committee's oversight visits to hear first-hand what women's issues are.Instead, nine delegates from the department were sent to a UN conference in New York on the status of women, in spite of the department's tight budget."One of our concerns is that the department is under skilled and underutilised," said Democratic Alliance MP Terri Stander.On the free sanitary towels programme to keep menstruating schoolgirls in class, there is still no indication on which department will do it, and how much it will cost, so it is unlikely to be up and running this year.Stander also expressed concern over the department's planned "national dialogues" because the department did not say where these would be held, how much these would cost, who would address them, and whether there would be counselling services and police on hand to assist women who come forward for help.She said it was not enough that the department promised a report after these dialogues, without even knowing what it was setting out to achieve."At the end of those dialogues, what are they going to tell us - 40 women suffer domestic violence? We know that."How is this intervention? How are these dialogues that we are spending this money on going to ultimately assist in preventing and eliminating violence against women?"&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
