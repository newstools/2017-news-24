More than 500 of those prisoners are being held under "administrative detention" - detention without trial.Eighty-six-year-old anti-apartheid struggle veteran and Robben Islander, Laloo Chiba as well as other political and media figures were set to join the #DignityStrikeSA hunger strike, including Deputy President of South Africa and the ANC, Cyril Ramaphosa, who is also a former chairperson of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation.Respect to all those South Africans on 24 hour #DignityStrike fast in solidarity with #PalestinianPoliticalPrisoners.

His support is globally significant as he might possibly be the most senior politician endorsing the demands of the Palestinian prisoners.&rdquo;Participants will be allowed to drink a sugar and salt water solution twice during the 24-hour period.&ldquo;We must pledge our continued support for the freedom and dignity of the Palestinian people, just as countless people across the world did for South Africans standing up against the brutal apartheid regime. I am convinced that those who support the Palestinian struggle will be willing to sacrifice their meals for 24 hours to boost the morale of our comrades in Palestine, who have been without food for almost a month,&rdquo; said Chiba.The solidarity action is supported by organisations including the National Coalition 4 Palestine, South African Jews for a Free Palestine, the Embassy of the State of Palestine, Ex Political Prisoners Association of South Africa, the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, and religious organisations.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
