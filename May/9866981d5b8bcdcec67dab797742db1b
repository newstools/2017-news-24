"It's been obvious in the last couple of days that more needs to be done to ensure that this is done in a proper manner."A board of inquiry set up by the United Nations will present a report at the end of July, Dujarric said.Swedish and US investigators are also looking into the case.In Kinshasa, the Congolese public prosecutor said earlier that he was investigating allegations that former development minister Clement Kanku may have been linked to the murders.In a telephone conversation with an alleged militia fighter, Kanku - now an opposition MP - seems to be discussing setting fire to a town as well as killing officials, according to a report by the New York Times.Kasai has seen a major spike in violence since September when government forces killed Kamwina Nsapu, a tribal chief and militia leader, who had rebelled against President Joseph Kabila.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
