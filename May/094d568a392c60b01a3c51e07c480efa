He said Molefe's return was "dangerous". Eskom risked facing court action, including from other hopefuls for the job."The first line is to call the minister and say that decision is dangerous. You are throwing the country, you are throwing the ANC; you are throwing Brian under the bus. Please go back and work with the board to rescind it," Mantashe said.Molefe's return heightened tensions within the party and the tripartite alliance. It was expected to be discussed during next week's national executive committee meeting.Mantashe criticised the ANC Youth League for criticising ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa, after he had criticised the Gupta-owned broadcaster ANN7.The ANCYL tweeted on Wednesday that Kodwa's utterances went against the ANC's principles.Kodwa had tweeted: "I feel your pain at this moment, you will never capture the ANC through lies and deception."He was reacting to an ANN7 report that quoted unnamed sources saying the ANC's top six had rejected Kodwa's statement, in which he described Molefe's return as reckless.Mantashe said it was not the first time the ANCYL was relegated to "henchmen of a faction" and unleashed on individuals."We lose the sense of having a youth league," Mantashe said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
