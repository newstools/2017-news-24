These are the words of a principal who lost four learners in the horrific minibus crash on the R25 near Verena, Mpumalanga on Friday afternoon. The minibus crashed into a truck. Twenty people were killed in the crash; 18 pupils and two adults. In total, nine learners from Mahlenga Senior Secondary School were involved in the accident. Four of them have already been discharged from hospital, while another is still in hospital. Christinah Tjiana has been the principal at the school since September 2014. Tjiana stays in Bronkhorstspruit, about 30km away. She was one of the many who immediately rushed to the scene when they were informed about the accident. "When I arrived, the paramedics were already there. It was one of the scariest things, I could not believe what I saw," Tjiana says.&nbsp; Jump to top
