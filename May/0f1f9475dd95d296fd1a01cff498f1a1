This is incorrect."...The remedial action has made that choice for the president, which is impermissible in law," the Presidency said, adding that these powers are nowhere in the Public Protector Act."Finally, the decision underpinning the remedial action, which is to outsource it, is irrational since the only conceivable deduction to be made is that the former public protector&rsquo;s term of office was coming to an end and she was unwilling for the office of the [new] public protector to continue with the investigation outside her control."The Presidency believed that for all of these reasons, his application for a court review of the findings did not mean he is opposed to the establishment of a commission of inquiry."What is at stake is the interpretation of the Constitution on a matter as fundamental as the powers of the head of state and government and the relationship of the executive branch with other branches."The review challenge is therefore aimed at clarifying and strengthening our constitutional jurisprudence on the roles of the executive, the judiciary and Chapter 9 institutions."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
