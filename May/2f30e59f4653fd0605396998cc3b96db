What we're trying instead is to stabilise the countries on the continent."German Chancellor Angela Merkel pledged $29.5m in aid to stop migrants heading for Europe during a tour of Africa last year, but Germany remains a destination for refugees fleeing war and for migrants seeking better lives.After trekking through the Sahara desert, many migrants arrive at Libya's coast where they climb aboard rickety boats and head for Italy.More than 1 000 have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean so far this year, according to the UN's refugee agency. Aid workers say the camps that have already sprung up in Libya are squalid and under the control of militias that have seized parts of the country since it plunged into chaos after Moammar Gaddafi's government was ousted in 2011.Gabriel's comments were echoed by Faki, a former Chadian foreign minister who took over as AU chair in March."It's impossible in the Sahara and the Sahel, with the huge scope, with the huge territory, it is very difficult to open camps to contain this flow of humanity," Faki said. "This has never really been a good solution."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
