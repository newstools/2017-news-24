The president's administration often characterises the political opposition as "fascists" trying to stage a coup.His comment drew strong criticism from the leaders of the Confederation of Israelite Associations of Venezuela, which represents the nation's Jewish community.In a statement, the group expressed "absolute repudiation" of any attempt to equate recent events with the persecution endured by Jews in Nazi Germany."That episode in the history of humanity, which cost 6 million Jews their lives, among them 1.5 million children, is unique and incomparable," it said.Any comparison with the protests that are aimed at Venezuelan officials during trips abroad contributes to a revisionist campaign seeking to nullify the horrors Jews endured, the confederation added.Venezuela once had a Jewish community that numbered about 25 000 people, but leaders say more than half have fled amid economic and political insecurity.Jews also faced incidents of hostility as the late President Hugo Chavez led campaigns against Israel, accusing the Israeli government of genocide against the Palestinians. In 2009, the largest synagogue in Caracas was vandalised. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
