Retrenchment of workers will be on the cards."According to Julius, Zuma didn't "bring our country to a halt on his own" as the ANC continues to support him.Holomisa later took to the podium and said: "We should be applauding the fact that we are such a democracy that when workers who are not happy with leaders ... can express themselves.""In another era, when we were led by the ancestors of some parties, the might of the state would be unleashed on those preventing the president to make his address."Holomisa also acknowledged that unemployment was too high in South Africa, but added that it was not the ANC's fault.After the debate, Thandi Modise, chairperson of the NCOP, admonished "honourable members who did not do what was honourable," and slept during the debate."It is disrespectful," she said sternly.She urged MPs to "stay awake and respect the electorate".From the NCOP's press box, it was unclear which MPs had nodded off. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
