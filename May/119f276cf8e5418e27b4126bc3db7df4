However credible sources have confirmed an undetermined number of civilian casualties," the statement said.Displaced people in the area have fled to the town's mosque, Catholic Church and the Doctors without Borders (MSF) hospital, it added.The head of MINUSCA Parfait Onanga-Anyanga warned the militias that the authorities would be "relentless" in finding and arresting those responsible for the killings."The blood of peacekeepers and the blood of innocent Central Africans will not fall in vain in this country," he said.On Monday, another Moroccan and four Cambodian soldiers were also killed in an attack on their convoy.UN officials said the bodies of the four Cambodian peacekeepers were badly mutilated, to the point of making identification difficult.MINUSCA deployed 10 000 troops and 2 000 police to the CAR following bloody sectarian fighting that erupted after the 2013 overthrow of leader Francois Bozize.Among Africa's poorest countries, the CAR descended into bloodshed pitting the anti-Balaka fighters against the mainly Muslim ex-Seleka rebels.While calm has been restored to the capital Bangui, parts of the country remain under the sway of armed groups.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
