Police and residents were preventing external troublemakers from getting in.&ldquo;The law must take its course and members of the public should refrain from passing judgment and finding the men guilty in the media,&rdquo; Buys said.&ldquo;Whoever commits murder, be it white on black or black on white, deserves a life sentence. We are, however, of the opinion that this incident is an example of the double standards that apply in South Africa at the moment given that the two persons involved happen to be Afrikaans males,&rdquo; he said.According to Coligny&rsquo;s businesspeople, race relations in the town were healthy and the situation was being blown out of proportion on social media and by people spreading rumours, Buys claimed.It was remarkable to see how Coligny residents were helping one another.&ldquo;This comes after serious damage had been done to private homes, businesses in the informal settlement that belong mainly to foreigners, and to shops in town,&rdquo; he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
