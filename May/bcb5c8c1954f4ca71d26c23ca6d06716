Period. It is seen as an absolute right and a woman's consent is not required," as well as "I still have to meet a black girl who was not raped at about 12. I am dead serious."Ministry spokesperson Mthunzi Mhaga on Thursday said the Judicial Service Committee (JSC) was busy processing the complaint when she tendered her resignation."Her resignation will obviate a protracted disciplinary process," Mhaga said.Jansen declined to comment."I can't talk to anybody at this stage. I am sorry," she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
