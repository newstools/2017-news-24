The situation is getting worse. If we don't continue the effort until the end of the year, we are very likely to end up with famine," he said.The UN said last week that Somalia will have 1.4 million acutely malnourished children by the end of the year, up 50 percent from late 2016.British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who co-hosted the conference along with Farmajo and Guterres, said: "We have the means to avoid a famine and stave off catastrophe if, and only if, we escalate our collective response.""Somalia remains a wounded country but it is in the process of being healed," he concluded.Arms embargo call&nbsp;Somalia, which has frequently topped the Fragile State Index, is under a new president, prime minister and parliament this year and the London conference was focused on underpinning stability in this electoral cycle.The agreed pact is aimed at ensuring that Somalia can take greater responsibility for its own security from the 22,000-strong African Union troop deployment.Farmajo called for the arms embargo on Somalia to be lifted in the near future, saying that if its army did not have better weapons than the Shabaab, the conflict would go on for another 10 years.US Defence Secretary James Mattis held talks with Farmajo at the conference and told reporters as he returned to Washington that the United States would continue kitting out the infantry with gear and non-lethal equipment."There is certainly an attitude of renewed hope based on the election of what appears to be a very good leader in terms of understanding the need for military security, but as well economic efforts," he said.According to a US defence official, the Pentagon currently has several hundred troops stationed in Somalia, primarily devoted to counter-terror training.The gathering also tried to secure a path towards debt relief in one of the world's poorest countries, which has a $5.3bn-standing debt pile and an annual national budget of $250 million -- half the humanitarian aid spend in a good year.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
