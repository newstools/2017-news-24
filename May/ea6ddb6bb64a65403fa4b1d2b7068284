"I don't want to talk anymore, talk to her," she said, pointing at Adonis.Four women from the neighbourhood have squeezed into the modest lounge with its bare concrete floor. They go over the details of Courtney's disappearance again.She was last seen near the cream-coloured double storey semi last Thursday."She is a quiet child," said Adonis.She would speak when she was part of the little posse of friends that ran in and out of each other's houses during the day.A police car pulls up and Courtney's mom and her dad Aaron are asked to watch CCTV footage they are following up on after a tip-off."It's not her. Her body language is different," Aaron said.New search partyNext door the squeaky strains of "I love you, you love me," fill the air from the cr&egrave;che children singing the famous Barney the purple dinosaur song."Not everybody can afford child care. People have it very hard over here," said another neighbour."We must follow up every lead," the investigating officer is heard telling her parents, and more police officers arrive.Outside, locals are preparing for a door-to-door search."There was a very strong prayer meeting as well yesterday," said Community Policing Forum member Margaret Clarke."Excuse the way I look, I have not even brushed my hair," said Clarke who has been helping track Courtney down.Heartbreaking - one of the sites of the search for missing #CourtneyPeters in Elsies.
