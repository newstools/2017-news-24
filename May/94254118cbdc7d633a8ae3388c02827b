But what is her greatest concern?News24 Correspondent Harare - President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s only daughter Bona has been appointed to the country&rsquo;s Censorship Board, which determines which parts of steamy films the people of Zimbabwe can watch and which they can&rsquo;t.To help her in this task is Mugabe&rsquo;s longstanding friend and confidante, Father Fidelis Mukonori, who is a Roman Catholic priest, and former education minister Aeneas Chigwedere, who was sued by his son two years ago for allegedly practising witchcraft and &ldquo;possessing goblins&rdquo;.Another well-known name on the board is Charity Charamba, the police spokesperson.Home Affairs Minister Ignatius Chombo said while Zimbabwe&rsquo;s constitution guaranteed freedom of expression, the Censorship Act gave powers to the board &ldquo;to ensure that these freedoms are reasonably limited so that they do not infringe on other people&rsquo;s rights&rdquo;.&ldquo;In today&rsquo;s environment where there is heightened scrutiny by members of the public, internet and social media use, you are going to be faced by many challenges in administering the act,&rdquo; Chombo said, in quotes carried by the official Herald.The new board will hold office for five years. Chigwedere, the new chairperson, will replace Heyi Malaba who is 96. Malaba&rsquo;s board famously demanded heavy editing of Fifty Shades of Grey, the movie based on the EL James novel. Some movie theatres refused to screen the edited version.Zimbabwe&rsquo;s pole dancers, known for their risqu&eacute; performances, are also monitored by the board. Probably the most famous of them, Bev Sibanda, was fined $100 three years ago for breaching the Censorship Act after photos of one dance session were deemed by the censorship board to be &ldquo;indecent&rdquo;.But with elections a year way, there will be fears that the new-look Censorship Board will also be used to clamp down on Zimbabwe&rsquo;s vibrant social media, which doesn&rsquo;t spare Mugabe and his government from robust criticism.A report by the state broadcaster, the ZBC, gave a hint of that when it said: &ldquo;The new board of censors&hellip; will have a mammoth task in carrying out its mandate as there has been rampant abuse of social media while also taking into consideration that general elections are set for next year.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
