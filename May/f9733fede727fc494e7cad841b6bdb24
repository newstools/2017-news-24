We are doing everything possible to work out what happened and to ensure their safe release without precondition and as quickly as possible," said Jean-Nicolas Marti, the head of the ICRC delegation.Northern Mali fell to jihadist groups linked to Al-Qaeda in March 2012, and although these forces were driven out of key towns by a French-led military intervention the following year, the Islamists have now spread further south.Three Malian jihadist groups with previous Al-Qaeda links recently joined forces to create the "Group to Support Islam and Muslims" (GSIM), led by Iyad Ag Ghaly of Ansar Dine, and have claimed several attacks against foreign and domestic forces. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
