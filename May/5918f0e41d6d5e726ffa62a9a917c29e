He said it was an executive decision that deserved protection from disclosure."It is even a level higher than the deliberations of the JSC, or just Cabinet minutes."Zuma's lawyers argued that the DA had already acknowledged this and, on that basis, was not entitled to any record of the decision.However, the DA said it wanted the court to review and set aside Zuma's decision to dismiss Pravin Gordhan as finance minister, and his Mcebisi Jonas as his deputy. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
