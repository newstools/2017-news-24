We're ready," one of the masked soldiers told AFP. Another soldier, who also wore a facemask and refused to give his name, said: "We wouldn't be doing this if we weren't willing to fight."Yao Kobena, a teacher in the city, told AFP on Saturday that resolving the conflict could prove more complicated than in other parts of the country."Don't forget that this city was the capital of the rebellion," he said, referring to the 2002 uprising by troops supporting President Alassane Ouattara against Laurent Gbagbo, who refused to accept his electoral defeat.The rebels controlled the northern half of Ivory Coast until 2011, and were later integrated into the army.The January mutiny by the former rebel soldiers saw the government promise to pay them 12 million CFA francs (18 000 euros) each, with an initial payment of five million francs that month.The remainder was to be paid this month, according to rebel sources.After meeting those demands, the government found itself facing mutinies by other troops and paramilitary gendarmes.Late on Thursday, a soldier presented as a spokesperson for some 8 400 former rebels said in a televised ceremony that they wished to apologise to President Ouattara for the mutiny.The world's top cocoa provider, Ivory Coast has an army numbering around 22 000 soldiers, among them many former rebels who were integrated into the armed forces after years of conflict. Last year, the government unveiled an ambitious plan to modernise the military, part of which would involve the departure of several thousand men, particularly ex-rebels, who will not be replaced.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
