"One of them was wounded. His life is not in danger," the UN mission, which is known by its French acronym, said, identifying him as a Moroccan soldier.Early on Saturday, another Moroccan soldier died in a similar attack on the base and a nearby Muslim-dominated area. MINUSCA said the assailants were members of a wide coalition including the anti-Balaka group who "attacked civilian populations, targeting in particular Muslims", another sign of the violence between Muslims and Christians that has ravaged the country. Medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres said: "In the span of a few hours, MSF has treated 21 wounded people at the hospital in Bangassou.""We call on all the parties... to start a ceasefire and to allow us access to the wounded," a statement said.On Monday, another Moroccan and four Cambodian soldiers were also killed in an attack on their convoy near Bangassou.MINUSCA deployed 10 000 troops and 2 000 police to the CAR following bloody sectarian fighting that erupted after the 2013 overthrow of leader Francois Bozize.Among Africa's poorest countries, the CAR descended into bloodshed pitting the anti-Balaka fighters against the mainly Muslim ex-Seleka rebels.While calm has been restored to the capital Bangui, parts of the country remain under the sway of armed groups.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
