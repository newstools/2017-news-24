It will be deeper than what is in Public Protector report on state capture, so the commission will go beyond the Public Protector report," Mantashe said.Madonsela had investigated the influence of Zuma's friends, the politically connected Gupta family, on the executive and state-owned enterprises.Her report implicated several Cabinet ministers, and the reinstated Eskom boss, Brian Molefe.The call for a judicial commission of inquiry was first made publicly by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
