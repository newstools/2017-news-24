The Tobeka Madiba-Zuma Foundation, in partnership the eThekwini Municipality and the UN Aids programme, said it led a dialogue in sexual health, violence directed at children, girls and women, for 500 girls from schools around Inanda, KwaMashu and Ntuzuma in Durban. The campaign aims to provide ongoing mentorship to young girls, linking them with other women leaders in communities, the foundation said in a statement. It said it also aimed to curb new HIV infections and ensure that, through the campaign, young girls had access to education and remained in school to maximise their economic opportunities. This would in turn ensure that young girls and women have access to good quality, comprehensive, life skills-based HIV- and sexuality education at schools through the government's schools health programme," Zuma said. “I would like to share with you the views and recommendations of a number of young girls from South Africa on issues ranging from violence against girls, and inability to negotiate safe sex. Their cries right now is that 'It's time to listen to the girls!' "These views were collected through discussion groups. These young girls come from different backgrounds, with the majority coming from rural and marginalised populations. We ask you fellow South Africans to stop and 'Listen to the Girl Children' and carefully consider this call,” she said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
