He said a little while ago.&rdquo;Novella, dressed in a grey suit, with a navy blue scarf almost obscuring the &lsquo;13&rsquo; tattoo on his neck, kept his eyes cast down.He recently pleaded not guilty to the murder.AmbushThe duty manager decided she would go across to their room to make sure everything was okay.Wasmuth and a colleague left at the same time to walk down to the mountain pool. They returned around 10 minutes later, where she saw Novella smoking on the terrace a few metres away.They got to the rope bridge and saw there were a lot of people at the room. Novella passed them, walked over the bridge and went to the room.She did not see him again.The defence said it was taken by surprise that &ldquo;95%&rdquo; of the witness&rsquo; evidence-in-chief was not contained in her two statements they received.Novella&rsquo;s lawyer William Booth accused the State of &ldquo;ambushing&rdquo; him.He would need time to raise the new evidence with his client and get instructions.Prosecutor Louise Friester-Sampson said much of the witness&rsquo;s evidence on Thursday came out of consultations in preparation for the trial.&ldquo;We are not obliged to re-take and re-take statements to cover all aspects. There is no malice from the State.&rdquo;The trial would resume on Monday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
