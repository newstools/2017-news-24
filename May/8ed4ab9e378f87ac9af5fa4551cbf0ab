We are liaising directly with the client regarding the matter," said Montso.'Very sad state of affairs'Workers got increasingly agitated when senior political figures failed to appear and explain the source of the problems to them. Council chief whip Truman Magubane, who tried to address the staff members, was heckled before he had even begun to speak.It later emerged that both Mayor Themba Njilo and his deputy Thobani Zuma were in Nquthu trying to garner votes for the ruling party in the by-election."So you would rather go to another municipality than attend to matters at home. This is a very sad state of affairs of our municipality, the leadership just seems removed from the problems that we have as workers," said one worker.Other workers spoke of a challenge of getting money to return home."I am now waiting for my relative to send me money so that I can go back home because I was pinning my hopes on withdrawing money in town, but then this happened. How one will come to work tomorrow is anybody&rsquo;s guess right now," said another.South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) spokesperson Sbu Molefe decried the response from the municipality, saying it showed a lack of sensitivity on the plight of workers."This is a reflection of a leadership vacuum that we have witnessed over the past months in the municipality. The least that could have been done would be to call a meeting and address workers quickly, not what we are seeing now," said Molefe.Samwu has been at loggerheads with municipality over the past and at some point threatened to disrupt an ANC Cadres Forum meeting that was addressed by party president Jacob Zuma.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
