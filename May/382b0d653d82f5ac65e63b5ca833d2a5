The extra peacekeepers were mandated by the Security Council after fighting in Juba in July last year killed hundreds of people and escalated the civil war across the country.Separately on Monday, the top UN humanitarian official in South Sudan, Serge Tissot, demanded protection for civilians forced to flee a recent government offensive in Kodok. Roughly 25 000 people have fled Kodok after heavy fighting in the area, according to the humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders.Some UN supplies for civilians displaced from Kodok have been looted by opposition forces and others in recent days, Tissot said in a statement. Late last week a UN spokesperson, Daniel Dickinson, said that peacekeepers had been blocked from accessing the fighting area near Kodok.South Sudan has become the world's fastest growing refugee crisis due to its civil war that began in December 2013. Roughly 1.8 million people have fled the country.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
