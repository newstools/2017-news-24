I come from a home that instilled good values in me. Those good values speak to serving people. If you are put in a position, do your work."She said none of those who were brought in or removed were less or more than other members."We all sign performance agreements with the president."She felt she had credibility and had earned her stripes.Dlodlo asked that citizens have faith and allow ministers to prove themselves."We go in there knowing our first port of call in terms of the work we do and who we are answering to is the people of South Africa. Let them test us." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
