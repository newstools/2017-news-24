Ntombizodwa Makhoba and Zinhle MapumuloAhead of Mother&rsquo;s Day, City Press asked a few of SA&rsquo;s better-known folk what their mums mean to them.Thabo Rakhale, Orlando Pirates midfielder"My mother means the world to me,&rdquo; says illustrious footballer Thabo Rakhale.For him, Mother&rsquo;s Day is important because it is the day we appreciate and recognise those who gave birth to us and raised us.But Thabo takes it one step further, believing that every day should be Mother&rsquo;s Day.&ldquo;My mother, Elizabeth, has been there for me through thick and thin. My mother is my best friend, I wouldn&rsquo;t trade her for anything,&rdquo; Thabo says.The midfielder says he has learnt lessons from his mother that he would one day like to instil in his two-month-old son, Katleho. These lessons include respect, patience and always staying humble no matter how much you&rsquo;ve achieved in life.Although by Tuesday Thabo had not yet made plans for what he was going to do for his mother today, he says he is definitely going to spoil her.&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll take her to a spa for the whole day and later cook dinner for her,&rdquo; he says.Thandy Matlaila, actress The popular Thandy Matlaila, known for her role as the drunkard Cleopatra in Mzansi Magic&rsquo;s telenovela The Queen, believes mothers should be celebrated every day, and not only on the second Sunday in May. Thandy (30) says that she and her mother Veronica (46), whom she affectionately calls Vee, are best friends. Veronica had her daughter when she was young and the two are more like sisters, and even call each other for advice.&ldquo;She removed the parental boundaries at an early age. One day, she woke up and said: &lsquo;Please stop calling me Mama. Call me Vee instead, as this will make you see me as your friend and not an authoritarian who you will have to hide your pain and happiness from,&rsquo;&rdquo; Thandy says.&ldquo;I share everything with my mother. She is the first person I think of when I&rsquo;m in trouble or when I&rsquo;m happy.&rdquo;One lesson she has learnt from her mother is never to seek validation from other people, which is a lesson that Veronica received from her own mother.Veronica didn&rsquo;t spend as much time with her mother as she does with her children Thandy, Neo and Thabang. She was 17 when she left her family home in Ngcobo in the Eastern Cape to study in Johannesburg. For years, Veronica lived far away from her mother, but she never forgot to make Mother&rsquo;s Day extra special for her.Veronica says: &ldquo;I remember the last one before she passed away. I ordered cake from a bakery in Ngcobo and it was collected by my brother, who didn&rsquo;t tell her anything until all her elderly friends arrived at her home. She called me in tears, happy about what I had done for her.&ldquo;I honestly miss those moments, but all is well with my soul.&rdquo;Veronica says that, if her mother was still alive, she would tell her that she dedicates her successes to her.&ldquo;Although she didn&rsquo;t go to university, she ensured that I became what I am today. I know at times she put me before her own needs. Thank you, Mama, I will always love you,&rdquo; Veronica says.&ldquo;Thandy, my only daughter and a big sister to my sons, has always been my friend, my prayer partner and my little sister.&rdquo;Today, Thandy and her mother are going to celebrate Mother&rsquo;s Day in an unusual way &ndash; they will visit female prisoners at Johannesburg Central Prison, which Thandy says is part of their &ldquo;mission work&rdquo;. &ldquo;We are Christ&rsquo;s ambassadors. What better gift can we give women behind bars than to spend a day with them on this special day?&rdquo; Thandy asks.Mapaseka Koetle, actress Mapaseka Koetle, who plays Dintle in e.tv soapie Scandal, says Mother&rsquo;s Day is a special day to celebrate those who &ldquo;shaped us to be the women we are today&rdquo;. &ldquo;My mother means everything to me. I am who I am today because of her. She&rsquo;s always there for me. She loves me, she supports me and she has taught me how to pray,&rdquo; she says. Mapaseka is also a mother now &ndash; of an eight-month-old daughter. She says she has dreams for her daughter, and of the kind of mother she would like to be.&ldquo;I want her to be loving, giving and, most importantly, to fear God. I also want her to be her own person and always fight for what she believes in,&rdquo; she says. Sadly, this year she won&rsquo;t be spending Mother&rsquo;s Day with her own mum, who lives in Bloemfontein. &ldquo;She knows I always spoil her and I&rsquo;m always there for her. I know my sister Rakgadi will take her out and spoil her.&rdquo; Being taught to be a &ldquo;prayer warrior&rdquo; is one of the most important lessons her mother has taught her, Mapaseka says.&ldquo;In Sesotho, my mother always says to me: &lsquo;O seke wa lebala ho rapela.&rsquo; [Don&rsquo;t forget to pray].&rdquo; To pray regularly and to respect people is what Mapaseka&rsquo;s mother, Suzan, says she was taught by her late mother Masechaba Molelekwa. These values, she says, are what she was determined to pass on to her own daughters.Like her actress daughter, she thinks Mother&rsquo;s Day is an extra special day during which mothers are celebrated for their worth and love.&ldquo;My mother meant the world to me because she groomed me to be the woman I am today. The best gift I&rsquo;ve ever received is love and warmth from my daughters,&rdquo; she says.TALK TO USDo you think mothers should be traditional and strict, or more like a friend to their children?SMS us on 35697 using the keyword MUMS and tell us what you think.
