Our members are still out looking for tracks and clues," Van der Linden said."Police forensic DNA specialists examined the car and clothing for further evidence today [Tuesday]. We hope to make a third arrest soon."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
