These words angered the community [and they] beat him up and hand him over to the police," he said.Sihlangu said that the child was not safe with her stepmother, as she may hold resentments against her."It would be safe if the child is safely tucked away at the orphanage. We are working together to ensure that such a process happens," said Sihlangu.Chief Eric Nxumalo of Amashangaan said: "What kind of parent is this man? It's such an embarrassment to even think of going to bed with your own child."The Amashangaan chief said that he would not welcome abuse in his community."I have zero tolerance for child abusers. He will never be welcomed back to Dark City or anywhere in the Nxumalo chieftain vicinity," he said.The Mpumalanga Department of Education was unavailable to comment about the school which had allegedly failed to report the pregnancy of an 11-year-old.The suspect was remanded into custody until June 5. &nbsp; Mhala SAPS spokesperson, Gugulethu Nyalungu said that the accused is still seeking a legal representative to assist his with bail application. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
