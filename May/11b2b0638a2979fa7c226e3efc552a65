An investigation has been concluded, and the docket has been sent to the NPA. The role of the NPA is simple &ndash; it must decide to either prosecute Jacob Zuma or not prosecute Jacob Zuma."Abrahams, who was present in the auditorium on Thursday, did not comment on Maimane's request. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
