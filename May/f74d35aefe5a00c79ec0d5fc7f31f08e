The Southern African country recently announced a shoot to kill policy against Zimbabwe's livestock which are found in that country. Authorities in Botswana claimed that they were forced to shoot the cattle because they were "affecting the country's beef export to the European Union market". They said they were not going to risk exposing their cattle to foot and mouth diseases from Zimbabwean cattle. According to the Chronicle newspaper, Zimbabwe's police national anti-stock theft co-ordinator Senior Assistant Commissioner Erasmus Makodza blasted the neighbouring country’s shoot to kill policy, saying it was not being properly implemented. He said that most of the cattle that were being shot in Botswana were stolen - as a result criminals would walk free as evidence against them was destroyed. He called for the revision of the neighbouring country’s shoot to kill policy. Reports in March indicated that Botswana authorities shot at least 22 cattle that were allegedly stolen from Zimbabwe's Bulilima district. A local headman Senganyodo Jetchen alleged at the time that Botswana nationals were stealing livestock from Zimbabwe. He claimed that four Zimbabwean villagers had lost their cattle to suspected Batswana thieves.     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
