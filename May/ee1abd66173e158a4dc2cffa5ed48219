He said the IPID claimed to have &ldquo;reliable information&rdquo; about the planned raid, but had failed to say where the information came from and why it had not yet been carried out.Phahlane said he was initially reluctant to comment on the matter through the media because he considered it &ldquo;unethical and counterproductive&rdquo; to do so. He respected the view of Parliament&rsquo;s police committee that the media not be used as a platform to resolve such issues.Earlier, IPID had said it believed the raid was a counter-attack to their ongoing investigation into Phahlane.It brought an urgent application in the High Court in Pretoria last Thursday, in a bid to interdict police officers facing probes by IPID from investigating IPID officials.This came after police charged the two IPID officers investigating Phahlane for corruption and money laundering, with crimes including fraud and extortion.IPID head Robert McBride said in an affidavit that their case against Phahlane was at an advanced stage and had been referred to the National Prosecuting Authority.Dlamini said IPID would not stop its investigations as the allegations were serious and had merit.&ldquo;The IPID will use all lawful means to safeguard its independence and it is committed to investigating without fear, favour or prejudice,&rdquo; Dlamini said.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
