Signatories to the deal - excluding delegates from the ruling majority - charged the bishops with gathering information that could allow Katumbi and fellow opposition politician Jean-Claude Muyambo to operate freely in DRC.Settling of scores&nbsp;Katumbi, a former Kabila ally who switched to the opposition in September, is awaiting trial for the alleged recruitment of mercenaries and has already been sentenced to three years in jail for seizing a building belonging to a Greek citizen.Muyambo was sentenced to five years on fraud charges linked to the same building."The two trials are simply a farce," the bishops' report said, adding their investigation had found Katumbi was charged on the basis of fabricated evidence "with the sole goal of bringing him to trial and convicting him".This suggests that Katumbi's trial was "a purely political settling of scores", the report added.Government spokesperson Lambert Mende told AFP the Church should address its requests to the courts rather than the president."Freedom is not obtained in this manner," said Celestin Tunda Ya Kasende, a spokesperson for the ruling majority, adding the Church should not put forward any proposals offering "privileged treatment for tie-wearing criminals".Katumbi, the charismatic owner of a football club, was named as a presidential candidate by the G7 group of opposition parties for the election that was due to take place at the end of 2016.Under the power-sharing deal reached on New Year's Eve, DRC is now set to hold an election by the end of 2017.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
