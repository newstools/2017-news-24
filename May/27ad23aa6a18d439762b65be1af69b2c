The veteran leader has failed to groom a successor in his 37 years in power.One of the camps calling itself "Team Lacoste" was linked to Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, while another faction made up of Young Turks trading by the name Generation 40 (G40) was reportedly linked to First Lady Grace Mugabe. G40 was said to be seeking to torpedo Mnangagwa&rsquo;s presidential ambitions.
