After South Africa I want to see another country highly developed,&rdquo; said Mugabe.His remarks, however, sparked outrage and ridicule worldwide, with Biti, who served as Mugabe&rsquo;s finance during the government of national unity between 2009 and 2013, telling News24 Mugabe was &ldquo;mad&rdquo;. Describing Mugabe&rsquo;s remarks as far off the mark, Biti said Mugabe&rsquo;s remarks gave credence to assertions the Zanu-PF leader was clueless on most state issues, particularly the economy.&ldquo;The suggestion that Zimbabwe is Africa&rsquo;s second economy is pathological and reflective of exhaustion, cognitive dissonance and dementia,&rdquo; said Biti.'Mugabe needs to wake up'Reports indicated that an estimated three million Zimbabweans were economic refugees due to Mugabe&rsquo;s failed policies.Economist and banker, Bhekithemba Mhlanga pointing out that that most people thought of fragile states in terms of countries such as Somalia a few years ago - but Zimbabwe was now a caricature of a similar state by most comparisons.&ldquo;&hellip;When you have a situation where the country has no currency of its own, faces massive liquidity crisis, unemployment at 90% and cannot provide effective health care - then it is a failed state, especially given that it once had all this in place,&rdquo; said Mhlanga. Mhlanga &nbsp;stressed that the fragility of Zimbabwe stemmed from two major sources - weak economic fundamentals and the opaque succession politics.&ldquo;Anyone who says otherwise is simply floating in the sphere of the angels - they are dreaming. Mugabe needs to wake up and smell the chaos,&rdquo; said the banker.'Taking issues too far'Thulani Mswelanto, the programmes manager at Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition, concurred, saying the country was indeed a &ldquo;fragile state&rdquo;.&ldquo;It is a low-income country characterised by weak state capacity and/or weak state legitimacy leaving citizens vulnerable to a range of shocks. The dearth in economic life and a highly contested political&nbsp; legitimacy of the state following a series of contested elections confirm that we are a failed state,&rdquo; said Mswelanto.However, Ernest Mudzengi, another political analyst and director of the Media Centre in Harare, said describing Zimbabwe as a fragile state was rather &ldquo;too harsh&rdquo; and taking issues too far.&ldquo;We still have things that are functional unlike in the former Somalia so we can&rsquo;t say Zimbabwe is a fragile state but a failed state yes. There is a world of difference between a fragile and failed state. Sure yes, a failed state we are,&rdquo; said Mudzengi.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
