Air Zimbabwe went to the EU when it had published new conditions. It had two planes, 767s, and they were told to comply with the conditions," Gumbo was quoted as saying. He told the Herald newspaper:"The ban is on two specific aircraft that fly long-haul to Europe. The airline has not been banned from flying into Europe."The national carrier is saddled with a reported debt of up to $300m. In March it was reported that a private plane had had to be chartered from Bahrain to take Mugabe to see his doctors in Singapore when the Air Zimbabwe plane he usually uses was grounded for maintenance.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
