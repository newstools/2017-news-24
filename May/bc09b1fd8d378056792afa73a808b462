The party's highest decision-making body between conferences debated the motion for two days, with the meeting ending late on Sunday evening.&nbsp;"He was very angry. It was the first time I have seen him so angry," said an NEC source.&nbsp;The source added that Zuma threatened ANC leaders in his closing address to stop criticising him in public as he will no longer continue to keep quiet.&nbsp;"I have been quiet because I don't want to harm the ANC, so continue attacking me in the media and you will see," Zuma is quoted saying to the ANC NEC.&nbsp;Also read:&nbsp;Rand rallies to strongest level in two months as ANC debates Zuma&rsquo;s exitThe president further warned the NEC that it should be the last time he faced a motion of no confidence.&nbsp;Zuma told the meeting he didn&rsquo;t understand calls for him to step down now as he was not standing for re-election at the party's elective conference in December.&nbsp;Zuma is also said to have slammed the Gauteng ANC for blaming him for the party&rsquo;s electoral decline, reminding the province that it had refused to distribute T-shirts bearing his name for the 2016 local government electoral campaign.&nbsp;He further blamed the party for losing the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality due to infighting that has plagued the ANC in the metro.&nbsp;Zuma also referred to an alleged plot to poison him in 2014, saying he knew who was behind the plot but did not want to harm the ANC.&nbsp;Second call to step down&nbsp;The NEC debated Zuma's political future after ANC policy guru Joel Netshitenzhe put forward the motion &ndash; the second motion in six months for Zuma to vacate his office.&nbsp;Two NEC members confirmed to News24 that Zuma had survived.&nbsp;A source who attended the meeting told News24 that as many as 70 NEC members speakers spoke for and against the motion.&nbsp;A Zuma supporter claimed that Zuma had the support of most speakers despite earlier confidence expressed by the faction opposing Zuma's leadership that their NEC support had grown.&nbsp;Unconfirmed reports were that at least 18 NEC members, including Cabinet ministers, supported Netshitenzhe's motion, but that considerably more ANC leaders spoke against the motion for Zuma to step down.&nbsp;Zuma supporters said it was easier to &ldquo;crush&rdquo; the motion this time than in November when former tourism minister Derek Hanekom unexpectedly tabled a motion for Zuma to go.&nbsp;* This is a developing story that will be updated as new information is confirmed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
