FOLLOWING voluble protests last year throughout the Midlands and KZN, farmers and landowners can celebrate a fracking ruling victory, following a court order interdicting the Minister of Mineral Resources from issuing mining exploration rights to Rhino Oil & Gas Exploration (Pty) Ltd.    This is the second anti-fracking ruling in the past month. The interdict, issued by the Pretoria High Court on 19 May, follows the recent ruling against the South African Agency for Promotion of Petroleum and Exploitation (Pasa), the Minister of Mineral Resources and Rhino Oil and Gas Exploration South Africa (Pty) Ltd on an application for exploration rights on more than 800 000 hectares in Northern KwaZulu-Natal. “While this is an interim interdict, which will only be made final once the merits of the application are argued, it remains another victory for our famers,” said Sandy La Marque, CEO of Kwanalu. The threat of mineral and gas exploration first became a reality for KZN farmers in late 2015 when Rhino Oil and Gas submitted their Notice of Application for exploration in the Midlands.    In 2016 a second application was submitted for exploration in Northern KZN. Both applications covered a total area of more than 1 600 000ha and in excess of 15 000 farms. “We know there is still a long road ahead in dealing with the matter, but we are elated with both rulings. The impact and outcomes of gas and mineral exploration will have much larger and longer-lasting consequences - not only for the agricultural sector but all those living in our province,” said La Marque Anyone who would like to contribute to the legal initiatives being undertaken can email Kwanalu on ethel@kwanalu.co.za or phone 033 342 9393.
