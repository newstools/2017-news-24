There are no conclusions," he said."We will present the conclusions we have at the appropriate time."In December, an official Egyptian investigative committee had said it found traces of explosives on victims' remains, but French officials at the time refused to draw conclusions on the cause of the accident.No group has come forward to claim responsibility for the crash, which killed 40 Egyptians, including the 10-member crew, 15 French citizens and victims from several other countries.French investigators had always favoured a mechanical fault as the crash cause, saying a fire broke out in or near the cockpit of the plane before it plunged 22,000 feet and swerved sharply prior to disappearing from radar screens.The French investigation source said earlier this month "the combustion or self-combustion of a tablet in the cockpit" was "the working hypothesis".But elements needed to prove it - such as debris from "the cabin or flight recorders" - were in Egypt and "the Egyptians have not shown a great willingness to collaborate", the source said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
