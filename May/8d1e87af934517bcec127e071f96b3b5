News24 CorrespondentJohannesburg - African philosophy &ndash; especially around areas on knowledge production and science &ndash; will be at the heart of a new centre opened by the University of Johannesburg, the institution said on Sunday. &ldquo;We do not speak of studying African philosophy, as one might study cave paintings in the Drakensberg,&rdquo; said Professor Alex Broadbent, the Executive Humanities Faculty Dean, in explaining the motivation behind the new African Centre for Epistemology and Philosophy of Science.&ldquo;We speak of doing African philosophy, engaging in a practice that is as alive and as changing as any other academic discipline.&rdquo; The centre was officially opened on Friday. It will host three umbrella projects: one looking at indigenous knowledge systems, another looking at health and medicine in Africa, and the third looking at rationality and power. &ldquo;The role of&hellip; [the centre], in this time and place, is to champion critical decolonisation, both against reactionary opposition to decolonisation, and against the temptations of dropping our critical guard,&rdquo; said Broadbent. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
