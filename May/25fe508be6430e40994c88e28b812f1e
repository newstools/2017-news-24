"My conscience is that I participated in trying to stop further deaths from happening."HorrifyingHe said at the time he stepped into the situation, ten workers had been killed and his intervention was to "say there is a disaster looming, more workers had been killed and are going to be killed".Ramaphosa explained that at the time, some of the workers had been hacked to death and their eyes had been ripped out and their hearts torn out. This, he said, had horrified him."You might say that doesn't matter but it did horrify me as a person and I then said we need to prevent this from happening. Yes, I may well have used unfortunate language in the messages I sent out."He then apologised for the messages adding that he had done so in the past."I have apologised and I do apologise that I did not use appropriate language but I never had the intention to have 34 other mine workers killed."'He told attendees that having worked for nine years for mine workers, he would not be responsible for their deaths.Ramaphosa said he served miners diligently, and got everything done to increase their wages as well as their living conditions, during his nine years as the general secretary at the National Union of Mineworkers."I put everything I had to advance the interest of mine workers. It could never be that I would then say 34 mine workers should be killed. I have apologised - this is where even as a leader, I'm willing and prepared to listen to advice and council of other leaders."Ramaphosa said African National Congress stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela had counselled him to address the matter and visit the area."Madikizela-Mandela has said to me: 'DP this matter needs to be addressed. I want to go with you to Marikana.' I have said, 'Mama, I will accept your counsel.'"Madikizela-Mandela was pained by the incident, he said."And I also felt pained by what happened in Marikana. I am willing to do that. I am going to be led by Mama in this regard." #Ramaphosa He apologises for the email he sent during the #Marikana massacre calling it a mistake @News24&mdash; lizzee (@lizTandwa) May 7, 2017#Ramaphosa He apologises for the email he sent during the #Marikana massacre calling it a mistake @News24#Ramaphosa Sasco leader ask who stands to be exploited by business, poor or rich @News24 pic.twitter.com/KXoquBXXuN&mdash; lizzee (@lizTandwa) May 7, 2017#Ramaphosa Sasco leader ask who stands to be exploited by business, poor or rich @News24 pic.twitter.com/KXoquBXXuN#Ramaphosa says certain individuals and families talk of radical economic transformation solely for their benefit @News24 pic.twitter.com/rDKIpR5wtJ&mdash; lizzee (@lizTandwa) May 7, 2017#Ramaphosa says certain individuals and families talk of radical economic transformation solely for their benefit @News24 pic.twitter.com/rDKIpR5wtJ#Ramaphosa on #StateCapture and the role of students @News24 pic.twitter.com/P7mZjHM0Vn&mdash; lizzee (@lizTandwa) May 7, 2017#Ramaphosa on #StateCapture and the role of students @News24 pic.twitter.com/P7mZjHM0Vn24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
