Saunders is a worker at a call centre, Lakay said."My client intends to appeal the means test, as he cannot afford a private defence lawyer," he said.The courtroom was filled to capacity, with several members of the public and the media seated on the courtroom floor.Before proceedings started, Magistrate Paul Visagie warned the public that he would not allow any disruptions in his courtroom.The atmosphere in the courtroom was tense, with police refusing to allow additional people into the already packed room.Joanie Fredericks, from the Mitchells Plain crisis forum, asked the public to stay silent."Can&rsquo;t you see Courtney&rsquo;s parents are here? How difficult do you think this must be for them," Fredricks said loudly.Pieters&rsquo; parents asked the media not to photograph them.They quickly left the court as soon as proceedings ended. The case was postponed to May 24.'All I can remember is how angry I was'Outside the court, more than 100 members of the public held up placards which called for an end to violence against women."Restore the death penalty today," one placard read.NPA spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said he wished that cases like this didn&rsquo;t have to come to court, because "by this stage, there is already a victim"."From January up to today&hellip; there are 19 children that have been killed in the Western Cape&hellip; It is a sad situation we find ourselves in," he said.Courtney was last seen playing outside her home in Elsies River on May 4. Her body was found on Saturday in a shallow grave next to unused railway tracks in the Epping Industrial area, roughly 2km from her home.Matthew Higgo, from the Ruyterwacht community watch, told News24 that he had been involved in the search for Courtney from the first day."We walked by foot to look for her. We looked everywhere, except Epping. On Saturday, we started looking in Epping when a constable found her," he said.Asked how he felt during the search, he said: "All I can remember is how angry I was." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
