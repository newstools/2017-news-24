Many efforts were made to address it, and we tried to keep it out of newspaper headlines."As it turns out, there has been a change of guard, and we are hoping that this type of matter will not arise on an ongoing basis."EFF MP Nazier Paulsen asked about allegations that Nhleko protected former Hawks personnel against IPID probes.Ramaphosa said MPs should ask IPID themselves about such a serious matter, and as leader of government business he had no control over that aspect of the two institutions.'Tell the president!'Ramaphosa told the House that he does what he can to ensure ministers report to Parliament."Members must provide Parliament with regular reports of matters under their control."Each time the Cabinet meets, the leader of government business produces a report and flags problems.""This matter I have dealt with quite extensively in this Parliament. If there is a lack of clarity on this matter, the Constitution is a document that should be studied closely.""Tell the president!"
