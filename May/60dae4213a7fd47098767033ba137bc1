police commissioner Arno Lamoer was held in camera at the Western Cape High
Court on Wednesday to privately present information about the health of
co-accused Salim Dawjee. Lamoer, brigadiers Darius van der Ross, Sharon Govender and
her husband Collin Govender, and businessman Dawjee have pleaded not guilty to
109 charges which include, corruption, racketeering and money laundering
involving around R1.6m. On 9 May, Dawjee was rushed to hospital from court and it
was subsequently reported that he was being treated for diabetes. On Wednesday, his counsel William King said Dawjee's bank
foreclosed on him when the information about his health emerged. He was worried that there would be further consequences if
the doctor waiting in the public gallery testified in an open court. Dawjee was also entitled to have his medical information
kept private, he said. State prosecutor Billy Downer had no objection to the
request, which was granted, and the court was cleared of members of the public
and the press. The accused have all pleaded not guilty and have said that
transactions used as evidence were above board, denying they were
''gratifications'' to further Dawjee's interests.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
