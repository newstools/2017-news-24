Her handlers have managed to obtain fortnightly samples of her milk over the past year.&ldquo;Shorty is an extremely placid elephant and loves her handlers. She didn&rsquo;t seem to mind the (milk) collection by them,&rdquo; said Lisa Marabini, the wildlife vet who is directing the Zimbabwean side of the project.Marabini, who is also director of the Aware Trust, said the project took two years of planning. Earlier this month, a year's supply of frozen milk samples were shipped to food biochemist and elephant milk expert, Garry Osthoff, at the University of the Free State.Fats and sugars&nbsp;Osthoff told News24 that he and his team aims to study the milk over a full lactation period: two years.&ldquo;Elephants&rsquo; milk is completely different from any other milk that we know,&rdquo; he told News24 in a phone interview.&ldquo;Apart from fats and sugars differing from other species, the milk composition changes over lactation to a much greater extent than that found in other mammals,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This means that a single surrogate milk formula will not do. At least four different formulas will have to be designed.&rdquo;Osthoff says there are close similarities between African and Asian elephant milk, meaning a surrogate milk formula that works in sub-Saharan Africa should help Asian elephants too.Wildlife vet Marabini said a better milk formula would help at least five orphaned elephant calves per year in Zimbabwe alone, and more in East Africa, where elephant poaching is higher.But she added: &ldquo;It is expected that, as poaching spreads, more and more calves in southern Africa may require assistance.&rdquo;At least 20 000 elephants were poached for their tusks in Africa in 2013, according to international wildlife regulators CITES. Some in the conservation world believe that figure - or at least something close to it - may well represent elephant losses every year in Africa.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
