We definitively renounce all our financial demands."In a sign of allegiance, he then saluted the president, the images showed.Ouattara said Thursday the country was going through a "very, very difficult time" after a fall in the price of cocoa led to a net loss of 150 billion francs CFA (230 million euros) to the state budget. The mutiny had "scared Ivorians, as well as those who want to invest in and visit the country," he said.He also announced that the government had given up plans to build new schools, a health centre and cultural centres across the country, as well as delaying until 2018 a key election promise &nbsp;bringing electricity to every village with more than 500 inhabitants.Last year, Ivory Coast launched an ambitious plan for the modernisation of the military, including an overhaul of personnel as well as purchases of materiel worth 1.2 billion euros.Part of the plan provides for the departure of several thousand men, particularly ex-rebels, who will not be replaced.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
