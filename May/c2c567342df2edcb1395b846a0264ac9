It will be between two to three years, and a maximum of five years."I think it can happen before, but if there are hiccups, we have set ourselves a period of five years."Magwaza and project lead Zodwa Mvulane told MPs that Sassa was meeting with the SA Post Office on Wednesday to discuss the areas in which it could assist in taking over the social grants scheme.The Post Office had a part to play in assisting the takeover, and their workshop this week would discuss how they would come on board.Magwaza stressed that current service provider Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) would definitely be phased out by the March 2018 deadline.Talks with Post OfficeThe Post Office discussions were necessary for the interim period until Sassa was ready for a full takeover.Beneficiary data would incrementally be migrated to Sassa, and would be done by January, another official said.Magwaza said they had made an enquiry with the Constitutional Court over the experts that must be appointed to oversee the year-long phasing out of CPS.Sassa had nominated experts on their side, and were waiting for the court to get back to them.MPs said they were concerned about the "lack of urgency" in the Post Office talks. Two months had gone by, leaving ten more months to phase out CPS.The idea of the workshop was not enough, and Scopa needed details about the talks with the Post Office, they said.Magwaza said he could send the committee a report once the talks were held, and asked for two weeks to reply. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
