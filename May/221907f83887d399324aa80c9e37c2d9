The available bursaries do not cater for subjects like history and languages for teacher training, they always insist on Maths and Science, which is unfair," he said.According to Motsumi residence fees increased from R35 000 in 2016, to R42 000 this year. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
