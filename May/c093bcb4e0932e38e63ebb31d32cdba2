Often improperly stored, the fake treatments are "toxic cocktails" whose low prices attract illiterate clients, Kouassi added.He estimates that such "street pharmacies" cost the country's legal pharmaceutical sector 40 to 50 billion CFA francs ($66-million to $83-million) each year, including about five billion francs of lost revenue for the government.One victim of the police operation, the president of a local association, called on people to change jobs "in order to avoid prison".Most vulnerable region&nbsp;"We are asking the government to help us reconvert. Many women make a living by selling these drugs, their primary activity," Sita Kone told AFP after her boutique was destroyed. Two months ago, authorities burned 50 tons of fake drugs valued at more than a million euros.Fake drugs make up around 10% of the global pharmaceutical market, according to the International Institute of Research Against Counterfeit Medicines.In Africa, nearly one drug out of three is illicit or counterfeit, making the continent the world's most vulnerable region to trafficking run by organised crime rings. Criminals take advantage of the fact that, unlike illegal drug trafficking, selling fake drugs remains largely unpunished around the world, since it is mainly considered a violation of intellectual property rights.But the drugs are responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide, according to IRACM. Most illicit pharmaceutical products come from India, sometimes authentic but often expired or sold as contraband, whereas most counterfeit drugs are manufactured in China, according to the World Customs Organisation.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
