So we invited him to our celebrations; it was a rally and we needed to feed people. &ldquo;That is why we slaughtered the 20 cows. It was not for the president, but for the people,&rdquo; he said. Mavundla, the former mayor of Greytown&rsquo;s Umvoti Local Municipality, is arguably the town&rsquo;s most colourful resident, with his three wives and 20 children.&ldquo;My oldest child is 31 and my youngest is three months,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am unashamedly polygamist. We critique polygamy, but I know many men who are married and have more than 10 girlfriends. My wives are happy. If that was not the case, they would have divorced me; they are not desperate.&rdquo;About reports that he personally offered to pay Zuma&rsquo;s portion of the R246m security upgrades to his Nkandla home, Mavundla said that was not his idea alone.&ldquo;The truth is that we came [together] as a collective and said, as a country, we are spending too much time discussing this Nkandla thing when we have so much [else] to do. To cut the noise, we decided to pay the debt,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Through our lawyer, we wrote to [former public protector] Thuli Madonsela, but, for her own reasons, she ignored us.&rdquo; When asked to elaborate on &ldquo;the collective&rdquo;, he declined. When asked about being a founding member of the Friends of Jacob Zuma Trust, established to support Zuma during his legal troubles in 2005, Mavundla said this was also a &ldquo;collective&rdquo; decision. &ldquo;I am not a bosom friend of the president. I don&rsquo;t have a special relationship with the president. I am not on a first-name basis with him and he is not like a friend that I can call any day,&rdquo; he said. However, he said that Zuma was his president &ldquo;just like he is the president of every other South African&rdquo;. &ldquo;I must also emphasise that I am a card-carrying member of the ANC and I have a leader, and that leader happens to be Zuma,&rdquo; he said. Mavundla, who is reputed to be stupendously wealthy, was coy about his businesses. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just say that I&rsquo;m a self-made man with a few businesses. In fact, I can tell you that I am one of a few black people who have been involved in some of the country&rsquo;s signature construction projects.&rdquo; Mavundla&rsquo;s companies were involved in the construction of Durban&rsquo;s Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre, King Shaka International Airport and the R20bn Ingula hydro-electricity scheme near Ladysmith.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
