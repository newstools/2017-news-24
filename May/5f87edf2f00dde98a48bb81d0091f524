At that stage I just left it as is."Hansraj said she received an invite to his house in the early days.'Do not go there to his place'He apparently phoned her and indicated she should come to his house for breakfast on a Sunday morning, as both Brigadier Govenders would be there, and that she could also meet then-provincial community safety MEC Lennit Max.She said she had told Collin Govender about the invite, and that he had said: "This man is mad. Do not go there to his place."When she asked Sharon Govender, she apparently also said: "Don&rsquo;t get involved there."Hansraj said Dawjee had phoned her again and asked why she was not coming. She said she had given him some sort of excuse.She also told the court about the drama surrounding a 2007 case involving Dawjee&rsquo;s nephew.Dawjee had apparently complained about a lack of feedback on the case, which involved the alleged unlicensed possession of a firearm.On February 14, 2012, an upset visible policing commander, Lieutenant Colonel Vlok, told her he had gone to Dawjee&rsquo;s shop to give him feedback on the case.She said Vlok witnessed Dawjee on the phone with Van der Ross, getting "abusive and aggressive" about another officer."He mentioned that he would kick Captain Engelbrecht, a female operational commander in the poes, he will fuck her up. He indicated she is a racist."Felt humiliatedVlok reported that he was disgusted and had left the shop, after which Dawjee apparently came out to apologise.Both Vlok and Engelbrecht made statements on the incident.Hansraj said Engelbrecht had felt humiliated and wanted her to do something about it.Six days later, she said Dawjee had come to her office and confronted her on his nephew&rsquo;s case.The court was shown a document on Wednesday that indicated that the case had already been withdrawn in 2011.She said the events that later transpired made her feel that his issue was not actually with the docket.Dawjee allegedly told her that the police inspectorate, for whom his brother worked, would be coming to her station. He apparently claimed it was a racist station and people would be transferred.She was astonished and alarmed that a civilian and businessman would have insight into internal police arrangements.Prosecutor Billy Downer indicated that all the people Hansraj had referred to would also testify.The trial continues. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
