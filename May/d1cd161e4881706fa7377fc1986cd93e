"Haftar was named by a parliament elected by the Libyan people. He is the head of the Libyan army. There is no doubt about that," he said on Monday, just days after a rare face-to-face meeting between Haftar and GNA head Fayez al-Sarraj in Abu Dhabi.Political agreement&nbsp;On Tuesday, Siala said he did not understand why his comments were seen as controversial since he had made the same remarks previously.Tensions soared in the Libyan capital after Siala's comments on Monday, with tanks and armoured vehicles deployed to protect the GNA's headquarters, witnesses said.On Tuesday, a powerful GNA-allied militia in Tripoli denounced the minister's remarks in a statement.It said the idea of the parliament giving Haftar legitimacy "went against the Libya political agreement" inked in December 2015 that gave rise to the unity government.That UN-brokered deal gave no role to Haftar or his forces, but the strongman has since imposed himself as a key player, especially after seizing the country's key oil terminals in September.Libya has been wracked by chaos since the 2011 revolt that toppled and killed longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi, with rival militias and authorities vying for control of the oil-rich country.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
