The arch of Birchenough Bridge rises 70m above the water - though it's unclear exactly what part of the bridge the man was trying to jump off from.Eventually a passer-by stopped and started counselling Muzvive, according to the report. After three hours, he eventually agreed to get down. The Manica Post said the passer-by was an official in Prophet Walter Magaya's church. Magaya is currently one of the most popular and prominent "prophets" in Zimbabwe, whose exploits receive wide press coverage and whose public services often attract bigger audiences than any political rally.Last month the former head of the State Procurement Board Charles Kuwaza committed suicide by jumping off the ninth floor of a building in Harare, the state-controlled Herald reported.Cases of suicide were on the up last year in economically-troubled Zimbabwe, China's Xinhua news agency reported on Friday, quoting the New Ziana agency. A police spokesperson told the agency that men committed suicide as a result of stress "which was related to bread-winning roles as well as general expectations by society."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
