The residents of Slovo Park were expected to get a R50m slice of the cake to supply power to them, following legal action against the City in 2015.About R40m of the R9.6bn allocated to Joburg Water would be set aside to improve sanitation in informal settlements.In order to improve the quality of life of residents, R28.7bn would be set aside for the Sustainable Services Cluster, which was aimed at advancing pro-poor development, with the housing department getting R847m. This was expected to increase to R3.5bn over the medium term.'Major housing crisis'The recent service delivery protests in Diepkloof and Eldorado Park over a lack of housing have seen properties being damaged, increases in traffic flow, an increase in informal settlements and backyard shacks, and dissatisfied communities. Dagada admitted that there was "a major housing crisis".In the face of this, the provincial government had reduced the Housing Top Structures Grant to R145m - down from R411m - in 2015/2016 financial year, resulting in the City only having the financial capacity to build 1 000 housing units."The city faces a backlog of over 300 000 units &ndash; the highest in the country &ndash; while experiencing ever decreasing grants from national and provincial government for the provision of housing," said Dagada.He announced intended repairs and maintenance to hostels across Johannesburg, also saying that beneficiaries would be provided with fully serviced plots of land by way of title deeds, in areas identified as suitable land.Targets for rental accommodation and mixed housing development units were increased over the medium term.Dagada, who took office nine months ago, said R30m would be set aside for five new community drug treatment centres in the areas of Westbury, Tladi, Eldorado Park, River Park, and 80 Albert Street, Inner City, something that should be well received considering the high rate of drug use and abuse.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
