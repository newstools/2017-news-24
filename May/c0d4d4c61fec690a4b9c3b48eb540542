	     Harare – Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe's nephew Patrick Zhuwawo has reportedly said that he doesn't see
anyone with potential to succeed his uncle, who turned 93 this year. According to The Standard, Zhuwawo said there was no leader in the ruling Zanu-PF party who was fit to succeed the nonagenarian.  Mugabe has been in power since 1980 when Zimbabwe gained its independence from British colonialism. Zanu-PF has already endorsed him as its presidential candidate for the upcoming 2018 elections. Zhuwawo said: "I am sure you heard the
president during his interview on the occasion of his birthday [saying that] the majority
of Zimbabweans do not see anyone who can succeed him". "Even
myself, there is no one I can see who has the potential to succeed the president." Mugabe himself said during an interview to mark his birthday in February
that the majority of people felt that he was the only acceptable candidate and
that he was supported by "everywhere in the party". Zhuwawo's remarks came at a
time when Zanu-PF was divided into two distinct factions that sought to outwit
each other to succeed Mugabe. The veteran leader has failed to groom a successor in his 37
years in power. One of the camps calling itself "Team Lacoste" was linked to Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, while another
faction made up of Young Turks trading by the name Generation 40 (G40) was reportedly
linked to First Lady Grace Mugabe. G40 was said to be seeking to torpedo Mnangagwa’s
presidential ambitions.  However, both Mnangagwa
and the First Lady have publicly denied habouring presidential ambitions.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
