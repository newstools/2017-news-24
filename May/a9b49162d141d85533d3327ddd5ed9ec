The first is to retain a totally criminalised legal framework. This was the SALRC&rsquo;s preferred option.The second favours the partial criminalisation of adult prostitution. It criminalises all role-players, except the person providing the sexual service. This option could, however, lead to exploited women being subjected to further violence and harm.Morutoa said the report&rsquo;s authors turn a blind eye to the "vociferous voice of sex workers... and is thus not linked to evidence".&ldquo;The full decriminalisation of sex work is the only model that respects the rights of sex workers with the potential to address the HIV crisis facing South Africa."The caucus would meet on Wednesday to explore its options.Masutha said it was important, given the varying views on the subject, and the cyclical trap that women providing sexual services found themselves in, that government received public input into the report. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
