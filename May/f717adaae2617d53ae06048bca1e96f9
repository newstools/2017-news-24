However, he was granted leave to appeal an enforcement order which stopped him from going to work.#Nltemeza Judge Mphahlele agrees with respondent (Mbalula) that the enforcement order still stands despite the appeal @News24&mdash; Alex Mitchley (@AlexMitchley) May 18, 2017#Nltemeza Judge Mphahlele agrees with respondent (Mbalula) that the enforcement order still stands despite the appeal @News24Mphahlele says this court is not competent to discuss the enforcement order that stands even if there is an appeal @News24 #Ntlemeza&mdash; Alex Mitchley (@AlexMitchley) May 18, 2017Mphahlele says this court is not competent to discuss the enforcement order that stands even if there is an appeal @News24 #Ntlemeza#Nltemeza Judge Mphahlele says the matter is not urgent and is struck off the role, with Nltmeza having to pay costs&mdash; Alex Mitchley (@AlexMitchley) May 18, 2017#Nltemeza Judge Mphahlele says the matter is not urgent and is struck off the role, with Nltmeza having to pay costs24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
