It has been captured."Phahlane claimed O'Sullivan was behind many IPID investigations, and that he had implicated every police official currently being investigated in wrongdoing."I would like to congratulate IPID and O'Sullivan for a well-orchestrated propaganda machine. They have been excellent. Nothing that is being investigated by IPID hasn't ended up in the media."Acting commissioner Gnl Phahlane &amp; Robert McBride both present to discuss alleged interference with IPID investigations by police. @News24 pic.twitter.com/LrXefVu3wc'Shocking, unprecedented'Police officials presented evidence of over 30 SMSes sent between IPID officials and O'Sullivan in the last year.They said a vehicle owned by O'Sullivan was used during the IPID&rsquo;s raid on Phahlane's R8m home, near Pretoria. He is under investigation for how he was able to afford this home.Phahlane said he and his wife earned R2.5m per year together and he did not need handouts.McBride said O'Sullivan only helped with six of the 67 statements they had in Phahlane's case.At one point, FF Plus MP Pieter Groenewald interjected and reminded the two: "This is Parliament! This is turning into a mudslinging match.""This is an absolutely unprecedented and absurd situation we find ourselves in," an exasperated DA MP Marius Redelinghuys said."To have two Constitutional organs of state both tasked with incredibly important Constitutional mandates at each other's throats in a public forum like this. It's shocking that we have gotten to this point."Beukman, pressed for time, had to conclude the testimony before lunchtime, with not much resolution between the parties.Beukman said Police Minister Fikile Mbalula would hopefully be called in to help restore relations between the warring units.The SAPS would present its budget votes to the committee later this week.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
