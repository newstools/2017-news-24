I love everybody',&rdquo; Palm said.The Palms have tried to find a bone marrow donor in South Africa, but have had no luck. They are hoping that somewhere overseas, there will be a compatible donor.If a match is found, it could cost up to R1 million, depending on which country the donor is from.&ldquo;You can't imagine that amount,&rdquo; Palm said. She was told their medical aid would not cover overseas treatment.However, she was told it was possible to have the operation for less, depending on which country had a match.Usually not one to ask for help, Zaida set up a&nbsp;crowd-funding campaign in the hopes that a donor will come through soon.In the meantime, they try to keep his routine as normal as possible, but hardly ever go out, or receive visitors. This is in case he catches somebody else's sniffles or tummy bug, which his body is not strong enough to fight off.He also can't go to cr&egrave;che in case he falls or has a hard knock because his platelet count is too low. His grandmother has stepped in to help look after him.Palm is full of praise for the staff at the Red Cross Children's Hospital, saying that everybody who works there treats patients with respect and kindness.&ldquo;They make everything so much easier,&rdquo; said Palm.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
