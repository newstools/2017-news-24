	     Cape Town - South Africa could once again miss the deadline for
digital migration due to “supply chain management irregularities" and
"collusion issues" parliament's portfolio committee heard on Tuesday. The initial deadline, as
determined by the International Telecommunication Union, was June 17, 2015. Due
to legal wrangling and power struggles between the newly established
departments of communications and telecommunications and the Postal Service,
South Africa missed that deadline. Former Communications minister
Faith Muthambi, who was the political head of the political debacle until last
month when President Jacob Zuma reshuffled his cabinet, had set a new deadline
of June 2018. However, the Department of Communications told Parliament that the process was facing a
funding challenge.  Deputy minister of Communications, Thandi
Mahambehlala, said the funding was not the only challenge. "Usassa (Universal Service and Access Agency of South Africa)
cancelled the contracts of the manufacturers," she said, and asked Basani Baloyi, department of communications'
acting director-general, to explain further. Baloyi explained that Usassa appointed three manufacturers for the set-top boxes required for digital migration and 27 service providers for its
installation. Supply chain management irregularities and "issues of
collusion" were brought to the department's attention. An investigation by
treasury followed. "The problem is, Usassa just unilaterally cancelled the
contracts," said Baloyi. "We're not only concerned about the money,
we might even miss the deadline." She also said some of the
service providers, who have stock, might sue. Committee chairperson Humphrey
Maxegwana said a joint meeting with the portfolio committee on
telecommunications and the postal service should by convened urgently. Digital migration is the
process of switching over from an analogue television signal to a digital
terrestrial television signal, allowing for the radio frequency spectrum to be
freed up and allowing for faster mobile data services.      24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
