All our privileges have been taken away.&rdquo; &nbsp; They say the food they get is made in dirty pots and they get ants, cockroaches, steel wool &ldquo;and everything in the food&rdquo;. &nbsp; Danie Kruger, the manager of the children&rsquo;s home, says the incident has been reported to the department of social development.&ldquo;The department has been requested to do an independent investigation in which members of the advisory board of the centre will be involved.&rdquo; &nbsp; He has asked the public not to share the video. &ldquo;We regard the video as defamatory and are seeking legal advice. People who make defamatory comments on social media open themselves to possible legal action.&rdquo; &nbsp; Mbangwa Xaba, spokesperson for the department, says social workers are investigating the accusations and a provisional report will be presented next Wednesday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
