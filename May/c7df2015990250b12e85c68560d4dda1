"Those killed are locals," a senior Liboi police officer said. "They all died on the spot when their vehicle ran over the explosive device."Another officer said Shabaab militants were suspected.Police headquarters declined to comment on the incident.The Islamist Shabaab have spent a decade fighting to overthrow Somalia's internationally backed government, attacking official, military and civilian targets, often using suicide bombers.Notable encroachments into Kenya included the 2013 Westgate mall and 2015 Garissa University attacks, while the group also attacked the Ugandan capital Kampala in 2010.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
