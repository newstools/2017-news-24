By now we should have reached 25% of our goals."FlusteredShe questioned whether the department had the ability to fulfil its role in achieving the NDP's goals."It does frighten me," she said.Acting director-general Tshediso Matona seemed somewhat flustered by Khoza's barrage."Personally I believe that we are on the right path," he said.He conceded, however, that the department could do better."We have plans to improve," he said, while Van Der Walt shook her head.This did little to persuade Khoza."You know, DG, I'm going to be very frank and honest with you," she said."I don't think your assumptions [on which the annual performance plan is based] is up to speed with the reality we're facing, I really don't think so."I don't think we should be wasting our time on this thing. We're going in circles and circles. Our dream is going to be deferred and deferred, until it fades away, and that is my concern."Buti Manamela, deputy minister for planning and monitoring in the presidency, said the presentation did not do the actual annual performance plan justice.He said there was a medium term strategic framework which fleshed out its plans more."We are appreciating the situation in which we find ourselves," he said.The National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) followed the department in making a presentation to the committee.Khoza said the committee was impressed with their "fiscal prudence" of late.She said the committee will praise people when they are doing good work, but "when we exercise oversight, we make people shiver". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
