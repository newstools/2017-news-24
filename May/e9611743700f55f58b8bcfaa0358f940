I receive briefings on matters, and he asks questions, but at no stage have I given the NPA instructions to prosecute or not prosecute, and when to do so."InvestigationMaimane insisted, citing Police Minister Fikile Mbalula, that the investigation was already complete and that the case docket was handed over to the NPA in August 2015."The NPA cannot carry out a mandate of selective prosecution. This is a direct violation of its duty to prosecute without fear, favour or prejudice."He said Abrahams had a simple job: Decide to charge or not charge, but insisted that citizens could not wait any longer.Abrahams, who was present at Masutha's press briefing on Thursday, did not comment on the matter.WATCH:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
