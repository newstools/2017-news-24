These transactions were made either in cash or through money transfer services from shops such as Shoprite.&ldquo;The girls are kept in the same house and the same room(s) in his house, and in his mission houses in Durban. One by one they are called into a dark room, where Omotoso makes sexual advances to them.&rdquo;He said the girls were given strict orders to always be clean as Omotoso wanted them to be clean all the time.&ldquo;When in the bedroom with him, they are given Vaseline petroleum jelly to massage him with, starting at the toes and spreading it on his entire body.&ldquo;He then makes them lie on the bed next to him and strokes himself while masturbating, and eventually ejaculates on their thighs,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Then he recites Psalm 51, as he prays after the sexual act.&rdquo;Plaatjies said that over time, the act would advance to sexual penetration, when Omotoso felt the girls had been properly initiated to satisfy his desires.&ldquo;The penetration is without a condom,&rdquo; said Plaatjies.He said Omotoso kept more than 40 girls at a time, over different periods, in these houses.&ldquo;He does not keep them in his own residence, but in houses called the mission houses,&rdquo; said Plaatjies.&ldquo;If they refuse, their benefits are withdrawn as a form of manipulation and punishment.&ldquo;The older girls, known as the handlers, bear the brunt if the recruits do not perform according to Omotoso&rsquo;s expectation.&rdquo;During the narration of her husband&rsquo;s conduct, Omotoso&rsquo;s wife, Taiwo, sighed and gasped in disbelief.Omotoso&rsquo;s lawyers have denied the allegations against him and lambasted the state for being vague.His legal representative, Alfonso Hatting, made his first presentation to the court on Friday, saying his client&rsquo;s rights were grossly violated during the arrest.He dismissed Plaatjies&rsquo; claims that the Hawks had found half-naked women at a Bloemfontein resort during the Easter weekend, when the crime fighters had acted on a tip-off that Omotoso was staying there.Omotoso sat with his eyes shut during his lawyers&rsquo; presentation of the affidavit.In the affidavit, Omotoso said he was ill-treated and manhandled by the police on the day of his arrest, shortly after he landed at Port Elizabeth International Airport.&ldquo;I was stopped in the middle of relieving myself at the airport toilets by gun-wielding men,&rdquo; it read.Omotoso said before he could work out what was going on, he looked up and found guns pointed at him.&ldquo;They tied my hands behind me with tight cables. When I asked them to loosen them a bit, they tied them even tighter,&rdquo; he said, adding that he was humiliated because many people took video clips of the arrest and the whole world had seen the way he was treated.&ldquo;There were journalists waiting for my arrest at the airport. My constitutional rights were violated,&rdquo; read the affidavit.Omotoso went on to express his disgust at the condition of the toilets at the Mount Road Police Station, where he was initially detained.&ldquo;I was put in a place with filthy toilets. I struggled to sleep. I now have flashbacks of the experiences,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have requested a psychologist because I am now becoming suicidal.&rdquo;His lawyers said they would be suing the state for the unlawful arrest of their client.The case has been postponed to Friday, pending the verification of Omotoso&rsquo;s two passports.TALK TO USWhat do you make of the big support Omotoso is receiving?&nbsp;SMS us on 35697 using the keyword PASTOR and tell us what you think.
