According to BBC, the law is aimed at boosting the east African country's economy and making it easier for young people and small scale farmers to secure loans. The chief executive of the Kenya Bankers Association, Habil Olaka, welcomed the new law, saying: "It is a good development for the industry", as banks were unable to give out credit to people who wanted to use their movable assets as surety.
