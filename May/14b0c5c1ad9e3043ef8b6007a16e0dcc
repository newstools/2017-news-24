It said in a statement that in response it had launched an independent management review, an unspecified "information campaign" and efforts to "deepen anti-fraud awareness and prevention measures.""Protecting lives is at the core of UNHCR's work, which makes the betrayal of trust we have seen in this case so galling," Assistant High Commissioner for Refugees George Okoth-Obbo said in the statement.Two of the staffers have resigned and internal "disciplinary processes" were underway against the others, UNHCR said.As the allegations emerged, the agency said it suspended normal resettlements from Kakuma, a 25-year-old camp now housing 172 000 refugees &mdash; mostly from South Sudan.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
