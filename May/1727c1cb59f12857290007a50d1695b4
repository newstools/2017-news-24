The popular hangout was closed, but bullet holes in the windows offered evidence of what had transpired there less than a week before. A nearby drinking hall was also chillingly quiet for phuza Thursday. Between 7pm and midnight, the establishment saw only 20 patrons, two of whom were women.As we chatted with the men &ndash; all of whom opted to remain anonymous &ndash; it didn&rsquo;t take long for their real attitudes towards women to be expressed.Faith in the police was low, and some men had created security forums to protect women who walked to and from commuter points to get to work and home again. A 28-year-old entrepreneur said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what is happening with our men these days, it&rsquo;s like [rape and abuse are] a fashion. As men, we are failing to bring change in our communities. I am panicking about what will happen to my young sisters at home when it gets late. South African justice is dead to me; they are all about bribes, nje. Now we have started forums that protect people who go to work in the morning.&rdquo; Offended twentysomethings, though, had a different view: &ldquo;You buy them Brazilian hair and then they tell you men are trash. That&rsquo;s just wrong ... if men are trash, women are trash too. Remember the woman who killed Flabba two years ago? There was no hashtag about women are trash then.&rdquo;The barman (29) reckoned: &ldquo;[Rapists] are cowards who are weak and fall victim to rage. You don&rsquo;t beat a woman, you see, women have small minds, so you have to play her just right.&rdquo; The woke waiter (24) opined: &ldquo;[A friend] was attacked, pinned against a wall. The skirt she was wearing was too short, apparently ... I even fear for my own safety. Bodies drop around here all the time, but only the high-profile cases make the news. It&rsquo;s usually never this quiet on a Thursday, but people are in shock. Men suck, bro.&rdquo; The sketch kid (19), twisting a nyaope joint, chipped in: &ldquo;If a woman says no to me, I double-check first, and then I do as she says ... one time with a girl I was dating, the sex got rough. It looked like she enjoyed it, although we didn&rsquo;t go out much after that. I think she wanted it that way.&rdquo;The crooked cop who pulled us over on the way home (late 40s) at midnight said: &ldquo;Every week, I hear about rape incidents. It isn&rsquo;t good. No, I&rsquo;ve never heard of Karabo. Not all of us rape. Now, young man, you were not wearing a seatbelt, I am going to have to give you a ticket unless you feel we can arrange something...&rdquo; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
