It will be difficult, if not impossible for our youth to take on responsible positions if they are left without hope at this age," Gwala said.The IFP believed the private, government, and education sectors needed to collaborate to determine what knowledge and skills young people should be taught to find rewarding work.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
