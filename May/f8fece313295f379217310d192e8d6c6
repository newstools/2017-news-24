I don't understand this in this one beloved country of ours," said Hunsinger.Manny de Freitas, DA MP, said it makes no sense and was "absolute nonsense".Magadzi said it seemed as if Transnet and Prasa were "two bulls in one kraal"."It's ridiculous. You should start finding yourselves."Turnaround planHiro Holele, executive in the office of Prasa's group CEO, who led the delegation, said they were not like two bulls."Transnet is the big brother, the rich brother," he said."But why take from the poor?" asked Magadzi."It (Transnet) charges us for using infrastructure the public already paid for," said Holele.Transnet charges Prasa R900m per year, while they pay Prasa only R150m.Dr Sipho Sithole, Prasa's group executive for strategy, told the committee Prasa would reach a turnaround phase in the next 12 months and it would reach a phase for growth and expansion within the next 36 months.De Freitas was not convinced and said it seemed as if this plan was drafted in "cloud cuckoo land".Leonard Ramatlakane, ANC MP, however, said the turnaround plan was "good news", but also reminded them of the present situation."We can't cast our eyes to 2020 whilst what we have currently is falling apart," he said.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
