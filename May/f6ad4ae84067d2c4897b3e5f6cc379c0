The situation in Coligny is serious but there is no reason to panic. The area&rsquo;s neighbourhood watch organisations are well-organised and are ready to assist the SAPS where necessary. "AfriForum also sent a team to Coligny to lend support."Mosweu's death sparked riots in the small North West town of Coligny with residents taking to the streets and looting and burning buildings.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
