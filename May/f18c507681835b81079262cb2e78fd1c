Lawsuits against public participation are aimed at sending a message to all activists that resisting the company, and others like it, poses personal risks,&rdquo; the CER said.The CER said that it was not the first time MRC sued activists.&ldquo;Last year, MRC and its CEO Mark Caruso sued Cape Town attorney Cormac Cullinan, Amadiba Crisis Committee activist Mzamo Dlamini, and John Clarke, a social worker, for defamation in relation to the company&rsquo;s involvement at Xolobeni. These claims are being defended,&rdquo; the CER said.Right2Know&rsquo;s Allison Tilley said they would decide on their next step after a public meeting expected to take place in Lutzville on Wednesday.&ldquo;It is clear that Qunya and MRC are now employing scare tactics against the lawyers who are providing legal assistance to the anti-mining activists.&ldquo;We stand in solidarity with CER and Cloete as they continue to challenge corporate corruption, fight for environmental justice and speak truth to power,&rdquo; the organisation said.CER will be opposing the summons.MRC spokesperson Anne Dunn said the company will not be responding to questions on the matter. &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
