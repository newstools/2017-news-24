According to&nbsp;SABC, at least 14 out of 30 registered political parties had already signed the pledge.&nbsp;The pledge was brokered by churches in Lesotho and supported by the United Nations.&nbsp;Bishop Mallane Taaso of the Anglican Church was quoted as saying that the pledge was aimed at ensuring post-election stability in the land locked African country."Look how good it is when brothers and sisters live in unity," Taaso was cited as saying.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
