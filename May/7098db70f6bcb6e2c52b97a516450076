"Hence we think that the executive should consider appealing the ruling&rdquo;.DA federal executive chair&nbsp;James Selfe said the ruling was a victory not only for the party, but for all South Africans who deserved to know on what basis Zuma made his &ldquo;disastrous&rdquo; decision.Last week, the DA filed an urgent application to force Zuma to supply his record of decision after he said the party was not entitled to see it.&ldquo;Now that the high court has confirmed that President Zuma must supply his record of decision within five days of today&rsquo;s ruling, our earlier application to review the rationality of his decision can proceed. The record of decision should also contain the now infamous &lsquo;intelligence report&rsquo; which South Africa and the court can fully interrogate,&rdquo; said Selfe.Zuma ought to have rationally foreseen the consequences of this reshuffle on the country. It would likely swell the ranks of the country's nine million unemployed, given ratings agencies' downgrades of the country's debt to junk status, which his decision precipitated, Selfe added.President spokesperson&nbsp;Bongani Ngqulunga was not immediately available for comment.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
