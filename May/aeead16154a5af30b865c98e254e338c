During his absence, his office had repeatedly denied claims the leader was ill and insisted he was "hale and hearty". But when he returned home, a gaunt-looking Buhari said he "couldn&rsquo;t recall being so sick since I was a young man" and described receiving "blood transfusions".The nature of his health was not revealed. Meanwhile, the founding chairperson of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Chief Bisi Akande has urged Nigerians to pray for Buhari&rsquo;s health, according to Vanguard. In a statement, Akande said: "The health of the leader [Buhari] is intricately intertwined with the health of the nation&hellip; I did not see President Buhari at the wedding of his adopted son in Kaduna last Saturday. I was sad and I wept. "When last we met at the wedding of his daughter in Abuja, last December, I complained to him that I was not happy about his stressful looks," Akande was quoted as saying.&nbsp;Buhari, where art thou? #WhereIsBuhari .@GarShehu .@MBuhari .@AsoRock .@DigiCommsNG .@OfficialPDPNig .@APCNigeria .@NGRSenate .@ProfOsinbajo pic.twitter.com/w77SQZBGCqAnd they say Nigeria has a president?
