He said it was an executive decision that deserved protection from disclosure."It is even a level higher than the deliberations of the JSC, or just Cabinet minutes."Zuma's lawyers argued that the DA had already acknowledged this and, on that basis, was not entitled to any record of the decision.However, the DA said it wanted the court to review and set aside Zuma's decision to dismiss Pravin Gordhan as finance minister, and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas.The DA said its application for a review of Zuma's move was unable to proceed because he had refused to file the record and reasons for his decision. This was "simply wrong as a matter of law".The review application and the application for the record were patently urgent given the extraordinarily serious and far-reaching nature of his reshuffle, the DA argued."For as long as they are not set aside, they will continue to have major prejudicial ramifications for the country."This was demonstrated by ratings agency S&amp;P Global and Fitch downgrading of SA to junk status."These downgrade decisions affect ordinary South Africans severely."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
