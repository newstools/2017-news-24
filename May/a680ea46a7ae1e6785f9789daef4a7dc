He was detained in December last year on suspicion of links to Boko Haram.He is said to be still in military custody.Civilians have been worst affected by the Boko Haram insurgency, with at least 20 000 people killed in Nigeria alone since 2009, and more than 2.6 million others made homeless.Aid agencies have warned that hundreds of thousands of people risk starvation because of a lack of food, as farmers have been unable to cultivate land due to the conflict, pushing up prices.Most of those staying in camps for the internally displaced or with family and friends are reliant on food aid, which humanitarian agencies say is threatened by a lack of funding. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
