While one group demonstrated peacefully, other members tried to gain entry onto the university's campus, where they were met by police who retaliated with teargas and stun grenades.Some Nehawu members managed to get past the officers, while others retreated and threw rocks and bricks at the police.Three Nehawu members were arrested.The clash between the protesters and police was short-lived, as the regional leadership managed to calm the situation, and got them to rejoin those who were dancing and singing peacefully at the university's front gate.UP classes were continuing as normal on Monday, as Nehawu members protested on the side of the road near the engineering department entrance.Jooste said salary negotiations had reached a deadlock after the union refused the university's offer of a 7% general salary increase, effective from March 1, 2017, as well as an additional R3 000 gratuity payment.Nehawu members are making their way down to UP main gate after their meeting #UPprotest @News24 pic.twitter.com/aNcP0c2riZ&mdash; Alex Mitchley (@AlexMitchley) May 22, 2017Nehawu members are making their way down to UP main gate after their meeting #UPprotest @News24 pic.twitter.com/aNcP0c2riZ#UPprotest members of Nehawu are making their way to the UP Engineering gate @News24 pic.twitter.com/MDQbjyATZr&mdash; Alex Mitchley (@AlexMitchley) May 22, 2017#UPprotest members of Nehawu are making their way to the UP Engineering gate @News24 pic.twitter.com/MDQbjyATZr 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
