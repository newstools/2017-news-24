UN officials feared he would be accused of treason, which they said carries the death penalty.A government spokesperson was not immediately available for comment on Friday.The UN did not give a reason for Livio's release, but the head of the UN peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, David Shearer, has been negotiating with the government for his freedom.Livio had been kept in South Sudan's most notorious prison, the National Security Service compound in the capital, Juba. That's according to a Danish businessman and former UN de-mining worker, Henrik Tobiesen, who was detained there for over two months before being released in late November.The UN on Friday said two other officials have been held in South Sudan without trial since 2014, but it did not give their names.South Sudan, which faces both civil war and famine, has cracked down on media.
