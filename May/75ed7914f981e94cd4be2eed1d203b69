It was not clear whether the civilian was in or near the vehicle at the time of the explosion.Last week 14 officers were killed in three separate blasts involving roadside bombs in different regions of northeastern Kenya along the border with Somalia.The Shabaab, a Somali-led jihadist group linked to Al-Qaeda, claimed responsibility for those attacks.Inspector General Joseph Boinnet of the Kenyan police warned that more such attacks were likely during the holy month of Ramadan.Since 2007, the Shabaab has fought to overthrow successive internationally-backed governments in Somalia but began attacking Kenya in 2011 after Nairobi ordered its troops into Somalia to fight the militants.Kenyan soldiers are now part of a 22 000-member African Union mission fighting there. In 2013, Shabaab gunmen raided a shopping mall in the capital Nairobi killing 67 people, and in 2015 a similar attack on a university in Garissa left 148 dead.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
