On that day [Yela] had been taken to Victoria hospital for a clinical exam," Booth said.&nbsp;"[The clinical exam] is not related to his state of mind. We were not informed that he would be taken to the hospital."&nbsp;On April 10, Yela failed to appear in court because he was treated for self-inflicted wounds to the abdomen. Booth later said Yela is at risk of committing suicide.&nbsp;Bawa postponed the matter to June 2 for Zabow to complete the mental health report.Yela would remain in custody.&nbsp;Yela is believed to have rented the holiday home for three weeks to visit his seven-year-old son and twins Maximo and Octavia.On April 6 he apparently sent a message to his ex-wife, Julia Engelhorn, asking her to come over for lunch.When she arrived, he is believed to have told her he had killed the twins.Engelhorn allegedly discovered the murdered twins when Yela threatened to kill her with a knife.&nbsp;She apparently jumped up, managed to escape and tried to alert a security official at the estate. She also alerted the school which her seven-year-old was attending.&nbsp;Yela was arrested on the M3 highway. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
