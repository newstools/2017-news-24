Sierra Leone authorities lack the necessary equipment for properly cleaning and polishing the uncut stone.The Ministry of Mines and Mineral Resources said last month it had tried to clean the diamond "by boiling (it) in hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid for 72 hours," but it was not enough to be able to set an accurate value estimate.Deputy mines minister, Ignosi Koroma, says the government is committed to achieving a competitive and transparent sale despite the underwhelming local bids.Diamond trafficking, notably to neighbouring Liberia, has left a deep scar on Sierra Leone after helping to foment a brutal civil war which lasted a decade from 1991.Experts say the money emanating from the smuggling trade in 'blood diamonds' helped to fuel the conflict in Sierra Leone and others in Africa.A year after the conflict ended in 2002, the Kimberley Process international certification scheme was created to keep so-called conflict diamonds out of the market and lay down export conditions applying to the agreement's 75 signatories.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
