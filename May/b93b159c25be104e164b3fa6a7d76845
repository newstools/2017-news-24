Our ultimate objective is to always ensure that the integrity of the social grants still remains intact."FOLLOW the social grants issue hereAmended regulationsThe first three respondents - SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) CEO Thokozani Magwaza, Sassa, and Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini - were ordered to pay costs.The Black Sash said in a statement on Monday that the judgment involved four court cases between Net1 Applied Technologies (Pty) Ltd against Sassa, the social development department, and others.In May 2016, the department published amended regulations to stop deductions.Net1 and some of its subsidiaries argued that the regulations be declared invalid. It wanted deductions and debit orders to continue being made from social grant beneficiaries' bank accounts.The four court cases were heard on October 17 and 18 2016.The Black Sash, as an intervening party, argued that if the court ruled in Net1's favour, the social development minister must be given the opportunity to amend the regulations to protect grant beneficiaries from exploitative practices.Western Cape spokesperson on community development, Marcellino Martin, said the ruling was "a huge blow to the poor which will further cripple the most vulnerable in our society".Martin said: "I do hope this judgment is taken on appeal&hellip; I will invite [Cash Paymaster Services] and Net1 to come and brief the Western Cape Standing Committee on Community Development and explain how and when the reimbursements for airtime and electricity will be settled."The law is very clear that deductions made from the pension grant should not exceed 10% and can only be made for funeral cover." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
