	     Polokwane - Limpopo detectives have launched a manhunt for a person who threatened to hurt and kill Polokwane Mayor Thembi Nkadimeng and her family. On Thursday and Friday, she received threats on her cellphone from a man who said he wanted to kill her and burn her house, said provincial police spokesperson, Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe. "The motive behind these threats is still unknown but the police investigations will tell as they are still unfolding." The alleged intimidator was identified, but no-one had yet been arrested. Similar threatening messages were posted by an African National Congress Youth League chair on social media. Nkadimeng was elected mayor in July 2014.
