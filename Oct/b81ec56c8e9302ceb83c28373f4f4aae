	       Nairobi - Kenya's election commission says President Uhuru Kenyatta has won last week's re-run election, which was boycotted by the main opposition group. Wafula Chebukati, the election commission chief, said on Monday that Kenyatta got 7.5 million votes, or 98% of the votes that were cast. The announcement that Kenyatta was the winner by a huge margin was expected because he faced no significant challenge after opposition leader Raila Odinga refused to participate, saying the election was a sham. Kenyatta was also declared the winner of a presidential vote in August, but that election was later nullified by the Supreme Court.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
