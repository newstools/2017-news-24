	       Nairobi - Protesters in western Kenya have thrown chairs and destroyed tents where a training camp was being set up for officials to prepare for this month's presidential election. The protest in the opposition stronghold of Kisumu city came shortly after a top Kenya election official resigned, saying the vote just eight days away "cannot meet the basic expectations of a credible election." The head of Kenya's election commission later said that despite "full technical preparedness" for the October 26 vote, it is "difficult to guarantee free, fair and credible elections." Kisumu's deputy governor, Mathews Ochieng Owili, says that "there is no way we are going for an election where the referee is partisan." Kenya's Supreme Court last month nullified the August election in which President Uhuru Kenyatta was declared the winner, citing irregularities.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
