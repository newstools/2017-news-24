Midrand police’s Captain Bernard Matimulane told News24 that a security officer was manning the guard room in the early hours of Thursday morning, while another security officer was in another room.  The two were moved to one room and tied up with shoelaces.  One robber allegedly kept an eye on them while the other seven suspects ransacked the school property for three hours, he said.  "During the robbery, about 66 computers and laptops belonging to the school were taken. The robbers gained entry into all of the affected offices by cutting the locks. The office of the school principal, the two vice principals, the staff rooms and the computer room were not spared," read a statement from Matimulane.  A cellphone belonging to one of the security officers was taken, and both men were robbed of money.  The robbers then allegedly fled the scene in a Toyota Quantum and two sedans. Matimulane appealed to anyone with information about the robbery which took place at Eqinisweni Secondary School to come forward.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
