	     Cape Town – A man who apparently came to the assistance of two women being mugged in Kloof Street lost his life after the alleged mugger stabbed him in the neck. Police spokesperson, captain FC van Wyk, confirmed that a 28-year-old man had been fatally stabbed in the neck on Wilkinson Street in Gardens on Saturday morning. He said the man had been giving chase to arrest a suspect who had accosted two females on Kloof Street, when the women tried to return a truck driver’s wallet that had fallen to the ground.  “The victim was assisted by other witnesses to stop the bleeding but he died due to injuries sustained,” said Van Wyk. According to a private Instagram post that News24 has seen, two women had been walking home from work early on Saturday morning, when they were mugged on the corner of Kloof Nek and Kloof Street. One of the women had been attacked and badly beaten. The unidentified man had apparently seen the women being mugged and rushed to their aid, chasing after the mugger. It was during this confrontation that the man was stabbed in the neck and died from his injuries. In the post, the woman described him as a "hero" who had run after the mugger. She did not know who he was, but would try to find his name. Van Wyk said a 20-year-old suspect had been arrested and handed over to the Cape Town Central police station and a case docket for murder will be investigated. He said the man would remain in custody until his first court appearance on Monday, 16 October, and police would be opposing his bail application. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
