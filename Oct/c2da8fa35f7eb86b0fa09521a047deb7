He has been charged with child abuse with an alternative charge of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. At a previous appearance in August, McBride was granted R10 000 bail and the case was postponed for the State to further investigate the matter. McBride's bail conditions forbid him from making contact with witnesses or contacting them through a third party. In a statement released after the alleged assault, McBride claimed that the case was opened by a woman who had asked him unsuccessfully to squash a traffic fine. He alleged that the assault claims were a "red herring" and part of a smear campaign against him by those he was investigating. He explained that he had become concerned about his daughter's school marks and "somewhat rebellious" behaviour, and had admonished her, but never assaulted her.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
