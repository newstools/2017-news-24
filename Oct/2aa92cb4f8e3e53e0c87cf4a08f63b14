	     Pietermaritzburg – A KwaZulu-Natal woman has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder and kidnapping of a 22-year-old woman who was beheaded with a bush knife in Donnybrook, police said on Wednesday. The High Court in Pietermaritzburg on Wednesday sentenced Jwayelile Khuboni, 39, to 25 years for the murder of Nomthandazo Dlamini and five years for her kidnapping, said Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane.  Dlamini's headless body was found on September 10 on the side of the road at Sunrise Forest in Donnybrook, in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands.  Zwane said it appeared that her head was chopped off with a bush knife.  He said Dlamini was last seen on September 7, when she left her home with Khuboni.  The next day her family reported her missing to the local police station and a search began. Head, arm missing "Both her arms and head were missing when she was found. A case of murder was then opened at Donnybrook for further investigation," Zwane said.  He said the investigation led to Khuboni's arrest on September 10. She then took the police to where she had left the 22-year-old woman's dismembered arms.  "Only one arm was found. The second arm, as well as the head, are still missing," he said.  Khuboni had on Tuesday pleaded guilty to the murder and kidnapping of Dlamini.  Provincial police commissioner Major General Bheki Langa welcomed the sentence.  "This is a fitting sentence as she showed no mercy when killing another woman," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
