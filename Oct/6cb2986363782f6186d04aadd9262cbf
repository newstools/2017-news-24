	     Polokwane - Two of the six prisoners on the run from Kutama Sinthumule maximum prison following a riot during the early morning hours on Friday, have been re-arrested. PHOTOS: Murderers, rapists among escaped prisonersLimpopo police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said an initial headcount had identified six prisoners who had escaped, but the number had since risen to seven. Mojapelo said the latest two arrests had taken place on Saturday morning when the escaped convicts were nabbed in a house at Shirley, in the Waterval policing area. “A member of the community supplied valuable information that led to their re-arrest,” he said. Mojapelo said the duo, Jabulani Isaac Mahlangu and Thomas Munyai were serving sentences on Rape and Murder respectively.  This brings the total number of escapees who were rearrested so far to three, after Chris Faku, who was serving time after being convicted of robbery with aggravating circumstances, was apprehended on Friday. The Provincial Commissioner of the South African Police Service in Limpopo, Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba thanked community members for their continued support and expressed much appreciation for their swiftness and willingness to work with the police to bring criminals to book.  Police have appealed to community members in the areas of Mavhungeni, Schoemansdal, Maebani and the surrounding farms to be on the lookout for suspicious looking persons and to come forward with any information to the Makhado Station Commander Colonel Mabatha at 0825658171 or Lieutenant Colonel Tshililo at 0824146272. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
