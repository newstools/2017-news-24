	     Johannesburg – The African National Congress on Friday said
it was studying the Supreme Court of Appeal's decision to dismiss the appeal
brought by President Jacob Zuma and the National Prosecuting Authority, in
relation to the reinstatement of corruption charges against Zuma. The appeal was dismissed with costs.  ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said in a statement: "The
ANC has full confidence in our judiciary and the options it offers to all
aggrieved parties. Accordingly, the ANC will study the judgment and await further
decisions from the affected parties before making a comprehensive statement on
this matter."    The Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein handed down
judgment in the appeal by Zuma and the NPA in the "spy tapes" saga
earlier on Friday. - See the Live Update Zuma and the NPA had approached the SCA seeking leave to
appeal the 2016 decision by the High Court in Pretoria to overturn the NPA's
decision to drop the corruption charges against Zuma that related to fraud,
racketeering and money laundering The 18 charges against Zuma were withdrawn in 2009, just
before he was sworn in for his first term as president, but the DA wanted the
charges to be reinstated. Both the NPA and Zuma turned to the SCA after the High Court
denied them direct access for an appeal. But last month Zuma and the NPA made an about-turn and
conceded that the decision not to prosecute Zuma was irrational.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
