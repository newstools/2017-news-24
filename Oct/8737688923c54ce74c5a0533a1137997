	     Douala - At least 17 people were killed over the weekend in clashes linked to a symbolic declaration of independence by Cameroon's anglophone minority, concurring sources said on Monday. Amnesty International said "at least" 17 people were killed by security forces in the country's two English-speaking regions, a figure that concurred with a toll given by official sources, who said two Nigerians were among the dead. An earlier tally compiled by AFP put the death toll at seven, who were shot dead by security forces. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
