	     Nairobi - More than 1 million Kenyan primary school students are writing exams this week, bringing some normalcy to this deeply divided country after an election that was boycotted by the main opposition group. The students on Tuesday started final exams ahead of enrollment in secondary school across Kenya, whose president, Uhuru Kenyatta, was declared the winner of an October 26 vote that opposition leader Raila Odinga said was a sham. The vote was a rerun of an August election that was nullified. There was concern that recent clashes between police and opposition supporters in some areas could disrupt the exams. There were no reports of unrest early on Tuesday. Kenyatta said the students' future "should not be disrupted by our politics" and Odinga also sent a message of encouragement to the children. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
