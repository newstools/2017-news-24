	     KOUGA has been invited to be part of a German project aimed at empowering municipalities to manage climate change at a local level. Executive Mayor Elza van Lingen, Social Services Portfolio Councillor Daniel Benson and Environmental Health manager Nomvula Machelesi left for Germany this week on a ten-day visit.  Funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, the trip will start with an international climate change workshop in Bremen, followed by a visit to Ilsfeld, the German municipality with which Kouga is set to partner. Van Lingen said the invitation, facilitated by the South African Local Government Association (Salga), could not have come at a better time. “We’re already feeling the effects of climate change in Kouga and are grateful for the opportunity to work with international partners on ways to mitigate its impact on our area and communities,” she said. The project, simply called “Municipal Climate Partnerships”, is being implemented by the development agencies Engagement Global and Service Agency Communities in One World (Skew) on behalf of the German government.  
 Its focus is on linking municipalities facing similar climate challenges with each other, so that the partner municipalities can design and implement joint programmes of action. The workshop at Bremen is targeted at municipal administrators and policy-makers, as well as representatives from civil society. Kouga Finance Portfolio Councillor Brenton Williams will be standing in for the Executive Mayor in her absence. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
