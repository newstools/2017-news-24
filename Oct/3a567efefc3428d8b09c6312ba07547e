	     Cape Town - A young woman survived an attempted rape ordeal
on Sunday afternoon after her attacker was hit by car on the N2 near Site C,
Khayelitsha. According to eyewitness reports, the woman was walking to
Driftsands using the fly-over pedestrian bridge when an okapi carrying man
accosted her. “He dragged me back towards Site C, I begged him not to harm
me. We walked and when we found a gap in the wall, he was the first to crawl in
and I used that chance to run away from him. He was quick, he grabbed me by my
hair but after a struggle I got free and ran onto the N2,” she said, sobbing. The man followed but his chase was cut short as an oncoming
car hit him. An ambulance arrived but nothing could be done to save the
man.  Police spokesperson Marcellus Rajap would not comment at
this stage, but said he would look into the matter. Meanwhile, a preliminary report from Western Cape Provincial
Traffic Services indicated that seven people died on the province’s roads over
the weekend. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
