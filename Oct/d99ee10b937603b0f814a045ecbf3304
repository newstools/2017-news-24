	     Harare - Zimbabwe's main opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, has been discharged from a South African hospital were he had been receiving medical treatment, his spokesperson said on Tuesday. "He was discharged last week [on] Monday. He is now fine, he is out of danger," Luke Tamborinyoka told AFP. Tamborinyoka declined to reveal when the former prime minister would return to Zimbabwe, saying only, "he will be back home soon". Tsvangirai, 65, was airlifted to South Africa two weeks ago after falling ill. The local NewsDay newspaper reported he had been given oxygen and a drip and had been vomiting heavily. His party said he was undergoing a routine medical check.  The veteran opposition leader announced last year that he had been diagnosed with cancer of the colon and had begun chemotherapy. Tsvangirai, a former trade union leader, has posed the biggest challenge to President Robert Mugabe's grip on power, and has often accused him and his government of rigging polls.  In 2008 Tsvangirai won 47.9% of the vote to Mugabe's 43.2%, which led to a run-off. He has been endorsed by the alliance of opposition parties to stand against Mugabe in the 2018 general elections. His adversary, 93-year-old Mugabe, regularly flies to Singapore, reportedly for health reasons. Details of his medical condition are kept under wraps, but he recently said doctors had given him a clean bill of health.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
