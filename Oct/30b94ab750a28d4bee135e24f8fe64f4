IN the Maritzburg Fever article (October 18) Dr Ray Ngcobo, general manager of economic development, said street vendors were removed in Church Street because of CBD decay.  Does this not apply to other areas like Hoosen Haffejee and Masukwane streets where support infrastructure for waste disposal is non-existent for informal vendors.  Vendors in these areas trade for free on the pavements and discard their waste right where it blocks storm-water drainage and feeds a thriving rat population.  Recent rains flooded lower Hoosen Haffejee and Masukwane streets and pavements leaving pedestrians with no place to stand or walk, the water levels reaching the entrance to buildings.  Formal and informal traders compete to sell the same goods and services, yet informal traders pay nothing for refuse removal or rates.  Street mechanics fight for space on the pavements and streets with barbers, bulk fruit and vegetable sellers and cooked food vendors in filthy conditions.  Whoonga  drug  dealers  openly  ply their trade too.  Will this ever change, or is it a reality we must all adjust to in the capital of KwaZulu-Natal?
