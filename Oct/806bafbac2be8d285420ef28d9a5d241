 RIET River tenants vowed to fight back and oppose their eviction after the owner of the farm, Logan Govender – managing member of Hope Fountain Investments CC, served them with eviction notices in August.  Residents say that they have been unfairly served with a notice to vacate their properties.   There are 25 people living on the farm, including children.  Tenants claim that Govender has refused to maintain and repair their dwellings.     The Weekly received copies of an agreement signed between residents and Hope Fountain Investments CC in 2011 whereby both parties agreed on the terms and conditions.  The agreements said that tenants agreed to vacate their dwellings on the condition that the owner of the land was going to give each family R15 000. Residents said they have been renting on the farm for the past 20 years, but their houses were falling apart.  “At the time we moved to Riet River there were houses that were built for the tenants. It was two-room and three-room houses. However, the residents started to renovate the houses and others extended them because the owner was not willing to renovate our dwellings,” added Kistanasamy.  According to an agreement, both parties agreed that those residents who had outstanding water and electricity consumption charges should pay ‘to the municipality before they vacate the property’ before April 1, 2012.  “Some of the residents who owed the municipality paid up their electricity and water bills. We waited for the owner to give us money before we could move. The landlord did not pay us anything. He did not even give us a cent as he promised. We have done a lot of things to these houses. He should have compensated us before giving tenants eviction notices.   “I was one of the residents in the forefront opposing our eviction before I moved to Phoenix. Unfortunately, I relocated to Phoenix after my son got married four years ago. The landlord will not get away with this. Residents are prepared to fight for what is theirs. I can testify even in court and tell the landlord that he never gave us money.”   Another tenant, Saria Dhanasar (50) said tenants used to pay R550 rent every month to the land owner.  “People have been doing maintenance in their homes. They get together and clean the area for themselves. We have been paying for water and electricity and we do not understand as to why the landlord wants to evict us.”  Dhanasar claimed that Govender imposed monthly rental increase to R1550.  “He added R1000 to our rent and when residents complained he said he had not increased it since the commencement of our occupancies.”  In a letter issued by Rental Housing Tribunal in September 27, 2011 the landlord said ‘the rentals collected in the amount of R550 per month from each tenant [was] not suitable to warrant the maintenance demanded by the tenants.’         24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
