Cape Town – University of Cape Town (UCT) students, led by the student representative council (SRC), have met at Jameson Hall to discuss the proposed fee increase for 2018. According to SRC member Sihle Lonzi, fees are set to increase by 8-10%. Lonzi said the university said it was operating at a deficit and was forced to increase fees between 8-10%. #uctshutdown 8-10% increase would not cover UCT’s expenses which would “be horrible for this institution, but we don’t care.” @TeamNews24 pic.twitter.com/exX68vGE21 Lonzi said the SRC would respond "decisively" to the proposed 8-10% hike, and would "be 'touring' campus this afternoon". The demands of the students include: UCT spokesperson Elijah Moholola told News24 that the university "states unequivocally that there has been no decision taken on the 2018 tuition and residence fees". Moholola said the university joined students in calling for the release of the Fees Commission report.  #UCTshutdown students asked to “tour” Campus to have “discussions on fees.” pic.twitter.com/MGIVHkco4u #UCTshutdown summary: - SRC vows to shut down. -fee increase of 8-10% proposed. - meeting at@6 pm to discuss way forward @TeamNews24 pic.twitter.com/9ZXFk9nSbr 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
