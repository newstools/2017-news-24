	     Polokwane - A convicted rapist and armed robber who was one of six who escaped from the Kutama Sinthumule maximum prison following Friday morning’s riot has been re-arrested. Escapee Tshengedzeni Manuka, 37, was nabbed in Waterval outside Louis Trichardt on Saturday afternoon. Locals tipped off the police, resulting in his rearrest. Three others are still on the run.  Limpopo police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo earlier told News24 that an initial headcount had showed six prisoners were missing, but has since been amended to seven. On Saturday morning, Jabulani Isaac Mahlangu and Thomas Munyai, serving sentences for rape and murder respectively, were apprehended. They were caught at a house in Shirley following a tip-off. Chris Faku, who was serving time after being convicted of robbery with aggravating circumstances, was apprehended on Friday. News24 on Friday reported that police are investigating cases of arson, malicious damage to property and escaping from custody after prisoners "went on the rampage, torched and damaged some of the prison facilities" on Thursday night, with the unrest continuing into Friday morning. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
