	     Harare – The Zimbabwean
government has reportedly said that the World Health Organisation (WHO) was the "biggest
loser" following its decision to revoke the appointment of President Robert
Mugabe as its Goodwill Ambassador for Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in
Africa. Mugabe, 93, was in
Uruguay last week where the WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesushe announced his goodwill ambassador role.  The nonagenarian's appointment was, however, met with shock and condemnation
by health officials and countries, including the United States, which sanctioned
Mugabe more than a decade ago over his government's human rights abuses.   Ghebreyesus on Sunday said he had
made the decision to rescind Mugabe's appointment after listening to the flood
of outrage and concerns voiced by international leaders and health experts.  He said he revoked Mugabe's position in the best interests of WHO. 'Biggest loser' But, according to Zimbabwe's state-owned
broadcaster ZBC, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walter Mzembi said that although Zimbabwe
respected the WHO's decision, "the global body is the biggest loser". "The
inordinate noise around the designation of the President [Mugabe] as WHO Global
Ambassador for Africa does not assist the cause in the first place. If anything
it is WHO that has benefited tremendously from its decision in nominating 
President Mugabe to lead the fight against NCDs through media 
amplification of WHO itself, and curiosity by the general public on what really
are NCDs, by tagging the name Mugabe to the debate. "On a name recognition
scale, this name beats them all, but it is our business to protect its brand
equity from unnecessary besmirching," Mzembi was quoted as saying. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
