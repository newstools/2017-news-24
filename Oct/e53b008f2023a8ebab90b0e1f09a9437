The deceased is unknown.  “The body was in a state of decomposition as a result it was not easy to determine the sex and race.” Ngwane said the remains were taken to the Phoenix government mortuary for a post-mortem.  “An inquest docket was opened and the case is being investigated by SAPS Tongaat detectives.
