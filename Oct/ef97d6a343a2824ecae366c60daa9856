	     Nairobi - Kenya's election commission said the results of a highly contentious election will be announced on Monday afternoon, despite voting not taking place in 25 protest-hit constituencies. "Having been satisfied that the results of the elections shall not be affected by voting in areas where the election was postponed, we therefore invite the presidential candidates for the announcement of the result at 15:30 today," the vice chairperson of the election board, Consolata Nkatha, said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
