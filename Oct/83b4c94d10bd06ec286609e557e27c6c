	     Nairobi - Kenyan police say a 12-year-old boy and three other people were shot and wounded in a western county when police opened fire to disperse violent protests by opposition supporters. A police official says the shootings occurred on Friday in Migori County and that unrest continues. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media. Police earlier on Friday reported the shooting death of a man in Kenya's Bungoma County as police fought protesters amid tensions over Thursday's repeat presidential election.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
