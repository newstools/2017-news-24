	     Cairo - The head of Egypt's minuscule Jewish community has voiced support for the country's Unesco candidate who has been criticised by Egyptian human rights activists. A statement from Magda Haroun says that Moushira Khattab has shown an impressive and "genuine commitment to our cause to protect Egypt's Jewish heritage". But Khattab has been also criticised for not speaking up against some of the government's repressive policies, such as shutting down public libraries founded by a top rights lawyer. A US educated longtime diplomat, Khattab is believed to be among the front-runners for the Unesco top post.  Voting by Unesco's 58-member executive board starts on Monday and continues through the week until a candidate wins a majority. The choice then goes to the full Unesco general assembly next month for final approval. Haroun says Khattab is a "courageous woman who has the talent of successfully taking on challenging causes." Egypt's Jewish community is made up of six Jews, including Magda. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
