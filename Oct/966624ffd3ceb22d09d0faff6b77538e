	     Freetown -  Sierra Leone's government says it has issued the necessary documents and awaits the arrival of 27 citizens being deported from the United States for drug crimes and other offenses. Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Emmanuel Turay said on Tuesday that the Sierra Leoneans were still in custody in the US. President Donald Trump's administration on September 12 announced visa restrictions on four African and Asian nations that have refused to accept citizens deported from the US. The restrictions affect Sierra Leone's foreign ministry and immigration officials. The US ambassador to Sierra Leone has said US authorities allowed the 27 Sierra Leone citizens to go through a legal process before issuing the emergency travel certificates to leave. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
