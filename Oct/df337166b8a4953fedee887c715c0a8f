– Residents of Johannesburg have been warned to brace themselves for heavy
rainfall and hail that could lead to flooding throughout Monday afternoon and
overnight. City Of Johannesburg’s Emergency
Management spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi
urged motorists to avoid crossing flooded low lying bridges and roads. Mulaudzi said young children
should stay away from drainage systems, river streams and dams to avoid
drowning incidents. “Residents of low-lying areas are
encouraged to continue to monitor water levels and move to high ground when the
levels rise,” said Mulaudzi. Mulaudzi also pleaded with
drivers to reduce their speed, to drive with extra caution and to keep a safe
following distance on slippery roads. He said residents must remain
alert as there might be localised flooding. “We have not yet received word of
any serious incidents relating to wet weather conditions. We encourage our
residents to continue to be cautious so that we can prevent any incidents during
these wet weather conditions.” All 28 fire stations throughout
the city,
as well as rescuers and disaster management officials would remain on
high alert throughout
the day and overnight. Officials will monitor all low
lying areas, especially informal settlements. Residents who want to report life-threatening emergencies can call 10177/
112 or 011 375 5911. Mulaudzi advised residents
to listen to the radio, watch television and read newspapers and to
