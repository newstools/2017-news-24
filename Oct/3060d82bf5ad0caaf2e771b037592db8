	     Johannesburg – Pre-suspension letters have been served to two Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) traffic officers from the Thokoza precinct, east of Johannesburg, whose video and pictures went viral on social media on Friday, Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago has confirmed. The officers have been served for bringing the department into disrepute and displaying unprofessional conduct. The pictures show the two uniformed officers showing off stacks of R100 and R200 bank notes while eating lunch from styrofoam lunch containers in the boot of a VW car. The video shows the officers listening to music, eating lunch and using the notes to pick their teeth and wipe their mouths. "Meat is being eaten, money is being eaten," someone says in Zulu, while a woman taking the video notes that there is a lot of money in the boot. “The two officers were identified, located and summoned to the EMPD headquarters where they were served with pre-suspension letters this afternoon,” read a statement. The duo is due to appear before the chief of police next Tuesday, to give reasons why they should not be suspended. Road Traffic Management Corporation's Simon Zwane told journalists earlier that the behaviour of the traffic cops was unacceptable. "Their behaviour shows how brazen they are, these traffic officers, they don't care. They've been getting away with it for a long time, but their days are numbered," he said. He said they were working with a unit to seize their assets. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
