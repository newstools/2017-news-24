	     Cape Town – An 18-year-old man was arrested in Queenstown, in the Eastern Cape, for the murder of a 30-year-old man in Philippi East, Cape Town, in January, Western Cape police said on Friday.  Police spokesperson Colonel Andrè Traut said police had been trying to locate the suspect the past few months. He is expected to appear in the Queenstown Magistrates' Court on Monday, where he will be transported to the Western Cape to face his murder charges, Traut told News24.   Philippi East has made headlines the past few weeks after 11 people were killed in a tavern shooting on Friday, September 29.  Two days earlier, seven people were killed in what is believed to be vigilante incident.  The suburb is one of the country's most dangerous with over 217 people killed in the area the past year.  Following the murders, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula announced that 40 extra police officers would be deployed to the area and a new station commander appointed.  At the time Mbalula said it is a "scientific fact" that the police were also fighting corrupt colleagues within their ranks. "Criminals are being assisted in most of the difficult crimes by the police," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
