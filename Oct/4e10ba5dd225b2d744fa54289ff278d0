	     Kampala - Two senior Ugandan police officers have been charged over the mysterious kidnapping of a Rwandan refugee who had been a member of his country's presidential guard. Officers Joel Aguma and Nixon Karuhanga appeared before a military court-martial on Friday in Kampala. Aguma leads the police's standards unit and Karuhanga once led a special operations unit. Joel Mutabazi was a member of Rwanda's presidential guard before he fled to Uganda, where he won refugee status. In 2013 he was repatriated to Rwanda, where he is serving a life term after being convicted of plotting against the government. It is not clear why the two police officers are being charged now, although Uganda's president urged a purge of "criminal" officers after the murder in March of a senior policeman. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
