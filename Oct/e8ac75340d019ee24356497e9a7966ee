	     Johannesburg – Two men were arrested after they were allegedly found in possession of a stolen copper cable worth R170 000, the Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) said. The two men, aged 26 and 37, were arrested in Dunswart near Boksburg, east of Johannesburg, on Tuesday afternoon, spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago said in a statement.   He said they were arrested as they entered a "scrap yard apparently with the intention of selling the loot". Kgasago said the suspected stolen copper cable was found at the back of the bakkie. The men allegedly broke into the Ekurhuleni electricity stores in Edenvale on Sunday night, Kgasago said.   "Officials from the electricity stores positively identified the copper as the one stolen on Sunday night from the electricity stores via the concealed barcodes on the wire," he said. The men are expected to appear in the Edenvale Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
