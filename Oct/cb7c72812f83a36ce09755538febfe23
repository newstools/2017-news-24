	     Paris - The Mogadishu truck bomb which on Saturday killed more than 300 people is one of the most deadly attacks using vehicles as a weapon over the past three decades. Here are some other examples:  Iraq in 2016: 323 dead  On July 3 an explosives-packed minibus blew up killing 323 in a packed street in central Baghdad, in an attack claimed by the jihadist Islamic State group. The enormous explosion, which set fire to several buildings and single-storey houses, happened in Karrada, a mainly Shiite shopping area in the capital which is very popular before the celebrations of the end of the fasting month of Ramadan. Iraq in 2007: 400 dead  On August 14 four suicide truck bombs exploded in the villages of Al-Khataniyah and Al-Adnaniyah, which were mainly inhabited by members of the Yazidi community in Iraq's northern province of Nineveh. The simultaneous attacks, blamed on Sunni Islamists, left more than 400 dead.  Indonesia in 2002: 202 dead  On October 12 a suicide bomber in a car packed with 1 100 kilos of TNT and chemicals in front of a nightclub in the tourist neighbourhood of Kuta, Bali's main seaside resort. Almost simultaneously a man activated his explosives-packed vest in a nearby restaurant - 202 people were killed and more than 300 people were injured.  The attack is blamed on Al-Qaeda-linked Jamaah Islamiyah, a South-East Asian Islamist network.   Kenya and Tanzania in 1998: 224 dead  On August 7 two truck bombs exploded near the US embassies in Nairobi and Dar es-Salaam, almost simultaneously, killing 224 and injuring more than 5 000. The explosion in the centre of the Kenyan capital killed 213 and damaged 40 surrounding buildings. In Tanzania's economic capital the attack left 11 dead and injured more than 70, all passers-by. The bomb had been placed in a tanker parked along the wall surrounding the embassy. Both attacks were claimed by Al-Qaeda.  India in 1993: 257 dead  On March 12, 257 people were killed and 1 000 injured in Mumbai in a wave of attacks that hit areas of the economic capital. The stock exchange, the offices of Air India, luxury hotels, a bus and shopping centres were the target of a dozen explosions, several caused by car bombs. The attacks, the most deadly in the history of the country, were planned by the Islamist underworld which wanted to avenge clashes between Hindus and Muslims which had left more than a thousand dead several months earlier.  Lebanon in 1983: 299 dead  On October 23, 241 American Marines are killed in a truck bomb at their base at Beirut airport. The same day a barracks housing French soldiers is also targeted in a similar attack, killing 58 French paratroopers.
