  ZULU King Goodwill Zwelithini honoured the legacy of King Shaka at the annual commemoration of the Zulu nation’s founder, the Umkhosi WeLembe at the Stanger High School Grounds on Heritage Day, September 24. Thousands of amabutho from around KwaZulu-Natal descended on KwaDukuza for this year’s festivities which were under the theme of social cohesion.    Although the day’s proceedings started later than usual, that did not deter the thousands who were waiting for their king. The royal household announced that this year’s event was shrouded by a dark cloud as two members of the royal family died in a car accident on Saturday as they were travelling back to the royal palace after doing some inspections in KwaDukuza before the event.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
