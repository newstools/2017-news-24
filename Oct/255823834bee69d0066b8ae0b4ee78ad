ER24 spokesperson, Russel Meiring, said paramedics had arrived on the scene and found an elderly man lying outside. Local security forces were already on the scene. “Paramedics assessed the man and found that, although no visible injuries were present, he had shown no signs of life.” “Unfortunately, nothing could be done for the man and he was declared dead on the scene,” he said.
