	     Nairobi - European Union election observers say actions by Kenya's rival political camps have damaged the electoral process and put Kenyans and their institutions in "an extremely difficult position." EU observers say in a preliminary statement on Tuesday that democracy and the rule of law have been diminished by the election rerun on October 26. President Uhuru Kenyatta was declared the overwhelming winner after a boycott by opposition leader Raila Odinga. The EU, whose observer mission was smaller than in the August 8 election that was nullified by the Supreme Court, says there has been intimidation of the judiciary, attacks on the election commission, efforts to disrupt the electoral process and some cases of excessive use of force by police. However, it says polling and counting was "generally well administered" and that there were some technical improvements.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
