	     Cairo - The Palestinian Authority is to take full control of Gaza by December 1 under the agreement reached on Thursday to end the split between Fatah and Hamas, Egypt's government said in a statement. The two movements agreed to "enable the national unity government to carry out its work and assume its full responsibility in running the Gaza Strip, as is the case in the West Bank, by December 1, 2017," said the statement released by the state information service in Egypt, which mediated in the talks.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
