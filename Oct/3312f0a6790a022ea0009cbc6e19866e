	     Johannesburg – A woman convicted of killing her husband in order to get his pension money was sentenced to 20 years in jail by the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. Mkhombiseni Gcabashe, 59, was found at home in Naledi, Soweto, lying on his bed on the evening of July 2 last year. He had suffered stab wounds to his upper body. He was declared dead on the scene by paramedics, Naledi police spokesperson Thulani Mbambala said in a statement. Police discovered through witness statements that his wife Thembisile Mdletshe, who was 49 at the time, had planned on killing her husband in order to get his pension money before his retirement. She was arrested and charged for his murder and found guilty on September 28. "No one is above the law in South Africa and we as the police will continue with our mandate to ensure that everyone in the country is and feel[s] safe at all times," Mbambala said, while welcoming the sentence.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
