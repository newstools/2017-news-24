	     Johannesburg – The ANC in the North West on Friday said its provincial executive committee (PEC) and its officials were not part of Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa's planned visit to the province. "We would like to distance ourselves from the programme as we are not taking part in it," ANC provincial secretary Dakota Legoete said in a statement.   "As a self-respecting movement, we don't want to set a wrong precedence for our presidential hopefuls of undermining the ANC's constitutional structures. "As a citizen of South Africa, the deputy president can, of course, visit any area of the country he chooses to. ANC Bokone Bophirima (North West) is just not part of the plans or the programme as a host or in any supportive role," Legoete said. The ANC on Friday released on its website Ramaphosa's programme, including the North West visit which the PEC denied being part of.   Ramaphosa is expected to visit the North West University's Potchefstroom campus on Saturday. He will also visit the Mogwase community hall on Sunday. The North West leadership has previously announced that it would endorse ANC national executive committee member Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as its preferred presidential candidate.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
