	     Monrovia - Former international footballer George Weah and Liberia's Vice President Joseph Boakai will face a run-off for the presidency on November 7, the national election commission announced on Sunday. With tallies in from 95.6% of polling stations, Weah took 39.0% of the votes and Boakai 29.1%, both well short of the 50% barrier required to win outright from the first round of voting held on Tuesday. National Elections Commission chair Jerome Korkoya told journalists that 1 550 923 votes had been counted and turnout was at 74.52%.  Three other candidates took a significant share of votes with veteran opposition leader Charles Brumskine at 9.8%, former Coca-Cola executive Alexander Cummings at 7.1% and former warlord turned preacher Prince Johnson at 7%. These candidates will now decide which run-off contender they will direct their supporters to follow, holding significant sway over the final results.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
