	       Nairobi - Kenyan police say one person has been shot and killed in a Nairobi slum as security forces moved to quell fighting between two groups of rioters. A police official says the shooting occurred in the capital's Kawangware area. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to reporters. Earlier Friday, stone-throwing protesters in Kawangware who support opposition leader Raila Odinga clashed with police who fired tear gas and water cannon. The rioters, many belonging to the Luo ethnic group, looted shops and set fire to at least one kiosk owned by an ethnic Kikuyu. Gangs with machetes then moved into the area, seeking revenge for the attack in what appeared to be an escalation of ethnic tensions. Witnesses saw one seriously injured man with a head wound from a machete blow.      24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
