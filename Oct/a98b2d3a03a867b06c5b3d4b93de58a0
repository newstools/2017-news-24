	     Krugersdorp – A dog that was trapped on a high ledge in the Kings Kloof area near Krugersdorp was rescued at the weekend after being spotted by mountain climbers. Members of the Mountain Club of South Africa had been on a training climb on the West Rand's treacherous rocky cliffs on Saturday when they spotted the Ridgeback cross, according to the National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) on Facebook. Nicknamed "Craggy", the climbers tried to keep the dog calm while NSPCA inspector Nadia Hansa made her way to the rock ledge. She then tranquilised Craggy and he was safely brought down the cliff. "Craggy was taken for immediate veterinary assistance and is recovering well," the NSPCA said. Just over a week ago, a dog in the Stellenbosch area found itself in a similar situation when it got stuck on a mountain ledge. Named "Dassie" by a rescue team, the ownerless Labrador cross was spotted through binoculars by Rita Trafford and eventually brought to safety.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
