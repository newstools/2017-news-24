	     Pretoria – No one was injured when an estimated 70 informal traders were removed from Tshwane House on Wednesday afternoon, city spokesperson Samkelo Mgobozi said.  The protesters stormed the City of Tshwane council buildings demanding answers from Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga following the halting of the Informal Traders' Bursary Fund.  The city's DA-led administration halted the fund when allegations of mismanagement emerged.  "They breached Tshwane House and law enforcement managed to keep them in the lobby," Mgobozi said. He said the protesters were safely removed from the building and they dispersed.  Tshwane central police spokesperson Aton Breedt said no case was lodged with the SAPS.  Plan to integrate fund The City of Tshwane said in July that the fund was stopped when the selection committee realised that there were no selection criteria for applicants.  "The city is looking at ways to restructure the programme to ensure that it is sustainable," Mgobozi said at the time.  The fund was initiated by the previous ANC-run administration to address informal traders' concerns about lack of educational funding for their children, which leads to unending generational poverty. Mgobozi said the fund should be integrated into a broader City of Tshwane bursary scheme, run by its department of corporate and shared services. "This will enable this responsibility to be handled by people with necessary knowledge and expertise in this regard." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
