Mogadishu - Funerals have begun and the death toll is expected to rise as Somalia reels from the deadliest single attack it's experienced to date. The government says 276 were killed in Saturday's truck bombing in Mogadishu and about 300 others are injured. Somalia is blaming the al-Shabaab extremist group, which has not commented. Officials say more than 70 critically injured people are being airlifted to Turkey for treatment as international aid begins to arrive. Nervous relatives stand on the tarmac at the airport, praying for the recovery of their loved ones. Overwhelmed hospitals in Mogadishu are struggling to assist other badly wounded victims, many burned beyond recognition.
