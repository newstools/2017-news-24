	     Cape Town - The boyfriend of murdered university graduate Aviwe Jam Jam has appointed a new attorney from a top Cape Town practice to represent him in his bid for bail in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court. Linda Ntulo, 26, appeared alongside his co-accused Leroy Morris for a bail application on Tuesday. His lawyer, David Mbazwana who previously represented both accused, said his mandate for Ntulo had been terminated. Danielle Sive from William Booth Attorneys confirmed that the firm would now be representing Ntulo. Attorney Asghar Mia would be on record for Ntulo when the application is heard on October 18. Ntulo, the father of Jam Jam's 2-year-old child, was arrested after appearing for a separate case in the Khayelitsha Magistrate’s Court.
