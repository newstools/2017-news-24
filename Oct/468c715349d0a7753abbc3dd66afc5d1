Julie Edwards – from Brean, a small town in Somerset, England – thought her dog, Molly, had grabbed a dead bird with her mouth, but was shocked to find that it was a male body part. “I could see she was about to roll something around,” Julie told Somerset Live. “It’s usually maggots or birds but I stopped her and saw it wasn’t that at all. “It definitely looked human to me. I think it was an intact penis and male testicles.” Devon Live reports that the gruesome discovery was made on Monday, 25 September. Soon after coming across the genitals, Julie contacted a beach warden who then informed the police. “We were called to Warren Road in Brean at 6.40pm on Monday after an item, possibly remains, were found washed up on the beach,” police said in a statement. “The matter has been referred to the coroner and we’re carrying out enquiries on behalf of the coroner to determine the nature of the item.” According to Daily Mail, police are now investigating whether the remains are actually that of a human. In a more recent statement, which was released three days after the first one, police said: “It was first reported to us as a body part, but investigations have revealed that it might not be a human body part.” “It could be another animal, or even a mineral. It will take time to figure out what it is exactly.” But Julie is undeterred. “It was more upsetting later on when you actually think that it could be someone’s relative,” she said.
