A white Mercedes Benz C-Class, a silver grey VW Golf 7 and a white Audi A4 are understood to have been used in the heist. “From the observation, it appears that [a] shooting took place about a kilometre from where the G4S vehicle overturned. About seven empty cartridges and AK47 and R5 ammunition were found on the scene,” he said. “They used explosives to access the safe and an undisclosed amount of money was stolen.” No arrests have been made The van occupants were not shot but injured in the accident, and one was later airlifted to hospital. ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak said when paramedics arrived at the scene, one of the van occupants was found a few metres away from the vehicle. “It is believed that he was ejected from the back of the vehicle when it overturned,” he said. “Paramedics and fire fighters had to use several rescue tools to free the driver that was still trapped in the front of the vehicle. They managed to break open the windscreen and remove the driver. “He was treated for injuries ranging from scrapes and bruises to possible back and neck injuries. He was later transported to hospital.”   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
