	     Cape Town – Western Cape police have arrested the son of a prominent former NP politician on Monday. Captain FC van Wyk told News24 on Monday evening that the son had been arrested in Belville on a Wellington warrant for failure to pay maintenance. He was married but got divorced in 2016. He was found guilty in the Randburg Magistrate's Court in 2015 of not paying maintenance for their two children. It was not yet clear if the latest arrest was connected to the conviction. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
