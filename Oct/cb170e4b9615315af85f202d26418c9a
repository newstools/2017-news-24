Hillcrest SAPS communications officer Captain Linzi Smith said officers received a tip-off from their crime intelligence about an unlicensed firearm in the Molweni Reserve. “Members reacted immediately and proceeded there with caution. Upon searching the premises they found one unlicensed firearm and ammunition.” Smith said the suspect then tried to bribe the arresting officers with cash, which they declined. “The suspect was arrested on three counts, one for possession of an unlicensed firearm, one for possession of unlicensed ammunition and one for bribery. “He was brought to the station and detained. Due to the quick reaction and efficiency an excellent arrest was made. The members are to be commended on an outstanding job well done.” Smith sends a stern warning to the public that the Hillcrest SAPS is taking a stand on corruption and bribery. “It is against the law to offer a bribe to a police officer in any circumstance. People caught offering brides to police will be charged accordingly. “I also advise the public to come forward if they are requested by the police to pay bribes. All information will be treated with confidentiality.” For more information, or to report cases, contact Hillcrest SAPS on 031 765 9116. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
