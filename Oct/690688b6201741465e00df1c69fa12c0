                 Adv Botha reexamines. Cameras clearly visible? Rabie says he can't say. #VanBreda If more than one person, higher chance that you will be seen? Yes, Rabie says. Easier to get in, but likely to be spotted. #VanBreda Rabie says there is a misconception that if you have electric fencing, you are completely safe. This isn't the case. #VanBreda Rabie says he would argue with Wyngaard, who says he drove along fence with light to check it. Not good monitoring to do both. #VanBreda Both security officers said no alarms or reports from Parow received. If office didn't contact them, wouldnt be aware, Rabie says. #VanBreda Any indication its system wasn't working that night like it's supposed to? Rabie says he can't say. #VanBreda Galloway cross-examining. Points out he didn't install it or maintain it. Rabie doesn't know the name of the system. #VanBreda Photos of De Zalze fence being shown. Rabie sees how it would be possible to bypass electric fencing. #VanBreda Can also jump over if there is something for you to use as 'stepping stone', or dig under the fence. Not impossible, Rabie says. #VanBreda Possible to get through electric fence,Rabie says.Use a stick to separate wires to create opening. Live, earth wires mustn't meet. #VanBreda Rabie says causes could be wires connecting, an animal, electronic issues on system, vegetation or fence being in poor condition. #VanBreda Dip in power can't cause activation. That is why the battery is there, immediately powers energiser, Rabie says. #VanBreda Could be poor connection to door, anything could cause it, Rabie says. Beam monitoring kiosk also activated. Can't say by what. #VanBreda Does person in Parow know what caused volage to fall? No, Rabie says. Not at all. #VanBreda Thorburn in Parow would contact De Zalze security to say if there is an issue with the fencing.  #VanBreda Conventional system means electricity to energiser (which powers fence) comes from Eskom or municipality via wiring. #VanBreda The former policeman has been in the electric fencing industry for 20 years. #VanBreda Owner of Energized Fencing, Charl Rabie, is the defence's next witness. #VanBreda pic.twitter.com/HVU4fATEUY She felt so safe at De Zalze she would go swim and leave her children at home in the early hours of the morning, Taljaard says. #VanBreda Fact you didn't hear it, doesn't mean Mrs Op't Hof couldn't, Blows says. Taljaard agrees. #VanBreda Was put to Op't Hof noise she heard was family watching Star Trek. You hear it? I was sleeping, so no. Didn't hear banging sounds. #VanBreda Double-storey house between Taljaard and #VanBreda home, Blows points out. Op't Hof's house closer, across road. No building in between. Taljaard says she didnâ€™t hear anything.Sound carries at De Zalze, she explains.Noise reported to security as homes close together. #VanBreda She's a light sleeper as she's a mom of 3.Stephanie Op't Hof testified that for two hours she heard angry voices coming from #VanBreda house Dropped kids and was in kitchen and didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Heard commotion outside, thought dirt collectors.  #VanBreda
