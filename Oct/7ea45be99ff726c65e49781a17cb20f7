  SA Community Crime Watch (SACCW) Medics received a call about a drowning at a dam in the Upper Highway area on Wednesday.  According to the SACCW founder Steven King, on arrival a 14-year-old had been pulled out of the water, and a nursing sister had started treating the patient. “A successful resuscitation was performed, and the patient was handed over to ER24 and transported to R.K.Khan Hospital for more treatment.” The girl is currently recovering well. King offered safety tips ahead of the upcoming warmer weather. “Swimming conditions can be unpredictable with water depth, temperature, currents and weather rapidly changing and one should always plan ahead.   “If one does not know how to swim well they should wear a life jacket. Children should never swim alone or without adult supervision.   “Children should be educated that swimming in open water is not the same as swimming in a pool.”   King said that people should wear a life jacket if swimming in a lake or river where there are no lifeguards.   “Always enter water feet first, never dive in. Also consider both safe entry and exit points when swimming in a river, dam or lake,” he added.
