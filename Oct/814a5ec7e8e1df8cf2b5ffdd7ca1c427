	     Cairo - Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi on Saturday named a new chief of staff of the armed forces. Sisi issued a decree naming Lieutenant General Mohamed Farid Hegazy as the country's new military chief, replacing Lieutenant General Mahmoud Hegazy. The latter was named as Presidential Adviser for Strategic Planning and Crisis Management. Mahmoud Hegazy had also served as the chairman of a contact group for Libya, among other roles, and the government's point man for managing Egypt's role in arbitrating between factions of that troubled country. No reason was given for the shuffling of roles between the two men, who are not related. The move comes a week after militants killed at least 16 security forces in an ambush during an anti-terrorist raid in the al-Wahat al-Bahriya area in Giza province, about 135km southwest of Cairo. Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media had reported dozens more killed. The conflicting casualty figures could not be reconciled. The Interior Ministry also announced its own shakeup, replacing the head of the National Security Agency, the agency's Giza directorate chief, as well as several other top security officials from areas around where the attack occurred. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
