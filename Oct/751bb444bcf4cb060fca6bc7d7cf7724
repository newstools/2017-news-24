Johannesburg - A video has emerged on Facebook of a person allegedly being robbed of R26Â 000 in a tuk-tuk in Westdene, Johannesburg. The video, which was posted by Sophiatown Neighbourhood Watch, shows two men get out of a haphazardly parked vehicle, believed to be a Toyota Etios, and approach the tuk-tuk. One of the men then sticks his head into the tuk-tuk and pulls out a bag, which presumably contains money. The man then casually walks back to the car and puts the bag in the back seat before driving off with his accomplice. Spokesperson for the Sophiatown police station, Warrant Officer TJ De Bruyn says although he is aware of the video and has seen it being circulated on social media, no case has yet been opened with them. Dauw Steyn, chairperson of Sophiatown Neighbourhood Watch, says the incident took place Monday morning around 11h50. He says the video was sent to them by a local resident who went to assist after the robbery. According to the source, the victim had been carrying the large sum because he had just sold his car. Dauw suspects the thieves were watching the tuk-tuk passenger when the car sale took place and knew he was carrying the cash.
