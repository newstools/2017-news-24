	       Nairobi - A Kenya police official says four people with gunshot wounds have been admitted to hospitals in the opposition stronghold of Kisumu county, where police used live ammunition to disperse protesters demanding reforms to the electoral commission ahead of a fresh election. The official says the four were wounded in a clash between protesters and police near Kondele slum in Kisumu city. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak with reporters. Opposition leader Raila Odinga on Tuesday withdrew his candidacy for the new presidential elections October 26, saying that without reforms the vote would face the same problems. The Supreme Court annulled President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election in August, citing irregularities. Opposition leaders have urged supporters to continue with planned protests against the election commission.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
