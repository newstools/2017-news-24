	     Johannesburg - Nine people were arrested at Fourways Mall, North of Johannesburg, following a brazen shootout on Thursday, Gauteng police confirmed. Police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo told News24 that police officers were patrolling the area around the mall when they saw an unknown number of suspects damaging two rival minibus-taxis with stones. "They jumped into another quantum, but police gave chase. They then ditched the taxi and fired shots at the police who were approaching them before jumping into the [Fourways] mall," said Masondo. He said although there were no firearms seized, nine suspects were arrested.  Masondo said it was unclear how many more suspects were still on the run. No injuries were reported. "We believe that this act was related to the ongoing taxi violence in the area," said Masondo. The area has been riddled with taxi violence with drivers feuding over their taxi routes.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
