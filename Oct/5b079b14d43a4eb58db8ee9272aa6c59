	     Polokwane – A pilot has escaped serious injury after he was forced to perform an emergency landing in Limpopo on Sunday, paramedic services said.  He had to land the light aircraft on the R529 outside Letsitel,  ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said, adding that paramedics were called to the scene by local farmers around midday.  Meiring said they found the aircraft on the side of the road.  "The pilot was found walking around on the scene. Paramedics assessed the man and found that he had sustained a small laceration to his thumb. Fortunately, no serious injuries or fatalities were found on the scene." It is believed that the man had to perform the emergency landing after his aircraft apparently lost power, Meiring said. Meiring added that local authorities were on the scene and would conduct a full investigation.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
