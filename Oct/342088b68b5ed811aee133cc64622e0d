"Truck drivers ran for safety and abandoned their trucks in the middle of the freeway when they saw the strike. We have arrested 29 suspects for public violence," he said. "There is a Nissan Almera that was burnt on Electron Road and we are not sure whether it is arson or [if] it was a mechanical fault. But it appears to be belonging to the metered taxi drivers or Uber." Later, a second Uber vehicle was torched. Uber spokesperson Samantha Allenberg confirmed that Uber drivers did not participate in the strike. - Are you there, or are you affected? Send us your eyewitness accounts and photos.
