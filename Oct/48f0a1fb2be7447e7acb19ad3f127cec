Executive director of Tshwane Strategic Communication Selby Bokaba said the Tshwane Bus Service (TBS) was surprised by the move because they were not informed of the employees' intentions. Two trucks blocked the entrance to the depot. Only three of 105 buses managed to exit before the gate was blocked. "Bus commuters in Centurion, Olievenhoutbosch, Danville, Pretoria East and some in Lotus Gardens have been severely affected by the strike," said Bokaba in a statement. Bokaba added that the disgruntled personnel, which include artisans, senior operators and general workers, embarked on the strike because of overtime-related grievances and the apparent outsourcing of work to external companies. "The City of Tshwane profusely apologises to our loyal bus commuters who have been left stranded and inconvenienced by the strike today. "We advise them to make alternative transport plans while we are resolving the issues that led to the strike," Bokaba said.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
