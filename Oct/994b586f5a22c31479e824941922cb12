Habibur Rehman, a government administrator, said rescue workers were searching for the remaining two workers in the Shrag area of the Harnai coal field. He said the rescue workers were using light machinery to do the delicate work. He said initially it was believed six workers were trapped in the partly collapsed mine, but records indicated nine workers were missing. Iftikhar Ahmed, a coal mine inspector, earlier said a landslide a day before caused a portion of the coal mine to cave in, trapping workers. Harnai district and its surroundings in southwestern Baluchistan province have rich coal and other mineral reserves but a poor infrastructure.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
