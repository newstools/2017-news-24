Pam Magwaza Following a rise in reports of farm murders in
SA, thousands have come together in protest against the violence. Dressed all in black in honour of farmers who
have been killed, protesters gathered early on Monday morning at various points
across the country, including Cape Town, Stellenbosch and Pretoria. A convoy of tractors and other farming vehicles is currently
heading from Stellenbosch to Cape Town and several roads have been blocked off.Here are 21 pictures of the protest action so far:  follow @teamnews24 journalists @pejames and @alexmitchley for live updates from the #farmmurders protests #blackmonday pic.twitter.com/c4z0llbg0y #blackmonday afriforum members and farmers are gathering at the voortrekker monument, to denounce farm attacks. pic.twitter.com/wwevkybshz #blackmonday this lady says she wants a better south africa. pic.twitter.com/stegyrqqvb hundreds of members of the farming community attending the #blackmonday protest gathering in klapmuts in the western cape. pic.twitter.com/cppld0qeku #blackmondaydays like these are interesting as one gets to see the real views. pic.twitter.com/83auh2wrty #blackmonday is on the move! pic.twitter.com/qmyfy1o6cx #blackmonday marchers gathering on a farm ahead of their march from klapmuts near stellenbosch to cape town #enca pic.twitter.com/29mpjoywfr the vaal - r59 route: roadway blocked rt @firstgroup_frt redan bridge r59 is closed @trafficsa #blackmonday pic.twitter.com/ofjg7obc0l #blackmonday prayer is about to start at the #voortrekkermonument in pretoria. pic.twitter.com/odqodmlndu #blackmonday prayer is about to start at the #voortrekkermonument in pretoria. pic.twitter.com/odqodmlndu those gathered say they are here to take a stand against farm attacks and murders #blackmonday #enca pic.twitter.com/4nw8erdsra #blackmonday crowd goes onto their needs to ask for forgiveness of saâ€™s sin.
