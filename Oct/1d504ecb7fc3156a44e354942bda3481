	     Johannesburg - The Johannesburg Metro Police (JMPD) have closed off a section of Beyers Naude drive as residents of Zandspruit informal settlement protest over electricity. Superintendent Edna Mamonyane said City Power officials cut off illegal electricity connections early on Wednesday morning, prompting residents to block off sections of the road. "It is quite volatile out there," she said. Mamonyane said the JMPD had dispatched its crowd management team to stabilise the area. "Residents blocked off the road with rocks and burning tyres. Our members are currently trying to deal with it," she said. Mamonyane advised people to look for alternative roads until the JMPD managed to clear up the road.
