	     The Khayelitsha Community Health Clinic recently organised a local imbizo with residents in order to get down to the facts on how to improve services. The meeting was held at the Site B Community Hall on Friday last week. It also intended to introduce the health committee members for the clinic, which consists of about 13 men and women. Nomzamo Yam, one of the health committee members, said the event was a good platform for residents to raise their concerns regarding the clinic and also to get information about health. “Among other things that we will have to sort out is the issue of folders which go missing.  This is due to carelessness. There are also the challenges of overcrowding at the clinic, with gangsters coming to finish-off their rivals in the ongoing territorial wars. “We need to intensify security, and we want to host more such imbizos in future, because they benefit all of us,” Yam said. Fundile Kupe, a resident, said the imbizo was necessary for the residents to raise their concerns. “They cleared our doubts regarding the folders that go missing. Folders are the backbone of our relationship with the clinic, as they carry our historical records as far as our health is concerned. Some of us need the folders in order to access government grants, as without them, no application is even considered. We have raised our grievances here and they have promised to sort them out. I am very happy for this opportunity.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
