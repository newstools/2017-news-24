	     Midrand – Nineteen children were injured after an alleged stampede at a primary school in Ivory Park, Midrand, on Friday afternoon. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said they had sustained minor to moderate injuries. Gauteng Department of Education spokesperson Steve Mabona said the learners from Ivory Park Primary School were taking part in a science mobile education presentation by the school and City Parks.  "City Parks was demonstrating a specific item, and learners at the back pushed forward to see what was shown. As a result, learners lost footing and tripped each other." Mabona said the presentation had to be stopped.  No serious injuries were reported.  He said learners would be discharged from hospital today.  "We wish all affected learners a speedy recovery and will continue to closely monitor the situation." Authorities were still investigating the incident. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
