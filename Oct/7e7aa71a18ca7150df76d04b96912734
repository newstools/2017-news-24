	     Kenya's journey back to the polls was marred by protest and violence on Thursday.

WATCH Nairobi - Kenya's election commission is asking Kenyans to be calm and patient while it counts and verifies results from Thursday's repeat presidential election. Commission chief Wafula Chebukati says he understands the fatigue that many Kenyans feel over the political uncertainty that has swept East Africa's economic hub. "We acknowledge the fact that you want to move on with your lives," Chebukati says. The main opposition group boycotted the election, which was a rerun of the Aug. 8 vote that was nullified by the Supreme Court for irregularities. In some areas, opposition supporters have fought police in clashes that turned deadly.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
