	     Johannesburg - National police management has reaffirmed its stance that striking 10111 employees would face disciplinary action after failing to return to work following a nationwide directive issued last week. The 10111 call centre workers had been on strike since July this year after demanding salary increases. Police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said police management had instructed call centre commanders to take disciplinary steps against employees who chose not to comply with the directive issued on September 28, instructing employees to return to work the following day.

Naidoo said an agreement was signed by the Safety and Security Sectoral Bargaining Council (SSSBC) and the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru), which is the majority union in the council. He said the South African Police Union (SAPU) which initially called the strike, was not a signatory to the agreement, and therefore the strike was "unprotected". "SAPU has been made aware of the agreement and that they can no longer claim protection of a protected strike. Unfortunately, the strike action continued and all the striking employees were called upon to immediately cease such action and return to duty no later than 29 September 2017 or face disciplinary action," Naidoo said.
