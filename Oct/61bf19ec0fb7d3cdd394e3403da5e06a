	     Cape Town - The case of the man accused of the murder of 11-year-old Stacha Arendse was transferred to the Western Cape High Court on Wednesday. According to Stacha's mother Sandy Markgraaf, who keeps supporters updated on Facebook, the accused, Randy Tango, will next appear on November 3 to face charges related to Stacha's murder. Tango, who is in his early 30s, was on parole when he was arrested after Stacha was found dead on Swartklip Road, Mitchell's Plain, early on Tuesday, March 28. She had been watching television with a friend in Tafelsig, west of Cape Town, on Monday, March 27 when she was reportedly called by somebody from outside, and then disappeared. After a lengthy search her body was found and Tango was arrested.  Her murder shook the community, which has formed a group, Mitchell's Plain Crisis Forum, that helps other families search for children who have gone missing and attends court cases to support families going through the same horror as Stacha's family. In a Facebook post ahead of Tango's latest appearance, Joanie Fredericks of the Mitchell's Plain Crisis Forum said that Stacha's death had brought strangers together to say "no more". She had "bestowed upon us the gift of loving and caring for one another and looking out for those who are not strong enough to defend themselves," wrote Fredericks. "Because it is through the beauty of Stacha Arendse's soul that people who never knew each other work side by side, day in and day out to seek for JUSTICE for victims of rape and murders (sic)." She said the forum would never tire of going to court to support victims' families. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
