	     Johannesburg - A school bus driver has been arrested after he allegedly sexually assaulted a 13-year-old pupil at a Gauteng primary school, provincial police said on Sunday. "Police believe that more victims may come forward," said Captain Lungelo Dlamini in a statement. It is alleged that the driver repeatedly touched the student inappropriately while she was boarding the bus.

Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said he was "saddened" to learn about the arrest of the bus driver. Lesufi said it was alleged that the driver had assaulted the pupil twice, on October 13 and 16.  "The case was subsequently reported to the police by the learner and an educator. The said perpetrator was arrested on Friday." Lesufi said the bus driver was due to appear in Lenasia Magistrate's Court on Monday.  "Unfortunately, he will never be allowed in our schooling environment. These activities will not be allowed to prevail in our space." Gauteng has recently been hit by sexual abuse cases at two other schools.
