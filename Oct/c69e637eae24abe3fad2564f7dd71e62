	     Johannesburg – A paedophile who sodomised young boys, aged between eight and thirteen from 2011 to 2016, has been sentenced to eight life sentences, police said on Thursday. Kevin Leon Thomson was sentenced on Tuesday by the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg after being convicted of raping young boys in Orlando and Eldorado Park, said Colonel Lungelo Dlamini. "The latest victims were raped during March 2016. He lived in the same area with the victims and would lure them to his residential place by promising them a bicycle. All the victims were penetrated," Dlamini said in a statement. Thomson was arrested earlier in 2017 and his case was referred to the High Court, according to Dlamini. "After sentencing, the judge also ordered that his name be entered in the national register of sexual offenders," said Dlamini. He was also declared unfit to possess a firearm. Thomson’s sentence comes after another rapist, Josias Mkansi - known as the balaclava rapist - was sentenced to 14 life terms for several counts of rape.   Gauteng provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Deliwe De Lange applauded the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences detectives for the successful investigation that led to Thomson’s sentencing. "Never again will these rapists have a chance to terrorise our communities and young people. Our communities must never allow any criminals to roam around, and should isolate them," De Lange added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
