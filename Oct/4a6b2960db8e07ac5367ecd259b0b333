	     El-Arish - Suspected Islamic State militants on Sunday attacked six checkpoints in the turbulent north of the Sinai Peninsula, killing seven soldiers and wounding 37, according to security and hospital officials. They said the near-simultaneous attacks took place at and around the town of Sheikh Zweid, with dozens of militants using heavy machine guns and mortars. Apache helicopter gunships were called in to repel the attackers, said the officials. No other details were immediately available. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. An army statement said 24 attackers were killed and two SUVs they
used were destroyed. The area was being combed by troops in pursuit of the
militants, the statement added. Egyptian security forces have for years battled militants in northern Sinai, which borders the Gaza Strip and Israel. But the insurgency there has gained momentum after the Egyptian military ousted an elected Islamist president in 2013. The insurgency is led by a local affiliate of the Islamic State group.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
