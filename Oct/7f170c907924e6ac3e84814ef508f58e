	     Cairo -  A planned gathering of international youth organised by the Egyptian government has been slammed on its own social media hashtag, with dozens of posts criticising leaders for their poor human rights record and campaigns against free speech. Billed as the "World Youth Forum" under the patronage of President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the event is scheduled for November 4-10 in the Red Sea city of Sharm el-Sheikh. It encouraged people to use the hashtag #WeNeedToTalk for English and Arabic posts. But by Tuesday, Twitter was alight with criticism, with users posting images of Egyptian police beating and chasing down youths during al-Sisi's reign, and images of youngsters incarcerated for political stances. One such case mentioned a student jailed for three years for posting a doctored image of al-Sisi wearing Mickey Mouse ears. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
