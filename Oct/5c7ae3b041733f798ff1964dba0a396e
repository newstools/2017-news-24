	     Polokwane - Limpopo premier Stan Mathabatha reshuffled his Cabinet on Wednesday.  He made four changes, moving ANC deputy provincial chairperson Jerry Ndou from public works, roads and infrastructure to cooperative governance, human settlement and traditional affairs.  Makoma Makhurupetje was moved from cooperative governance to transport and community safety. Social Development MEC Joyce Mashamba was moved to agriculture, swapping with Mapula Mokaba-Phukwana.  Education MEC Ishmael Kgetjepe; Economic Development, Environment and Tourism MEC Seaparo Sekoati, Treasury MEC Rob Tooley; and Sports, Arts and Culture MEC Onicca Moloi remained in their portfolios.  The premier's spokesperson, Kenny Mathivha, said Mathabatha has decided to make the changes to his executive after assessing the performance of the provincial government.  "The premier trusts these changes will add the necessary value in the improvement of the lives of our people," said Mathivha.  Mathabatha’s executive is believed to be supporting deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa to take over from Zuma during the upcoming ANC’s elective conference.  However, Makhurupetje and Mokaba-Phukwana are known supporters of presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, as the province remains divided over preferred candidates.  Dlamini-Zuma is earning support from politicians who were sidelined after Mathabatha was brought in the province. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
