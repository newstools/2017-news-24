Lethiwe Makhanya “I THOUGHT I was going to die,” said a terrified customer at supermarket in Balhambra Way, Northdale last Thursday.  Speaking to Maritzburg Fever the customer said he was at Chaldin Supermarket, but refused to give his name for fear of victimisation. He said there were 12 customers inside when the robbers entered.  “We didn’t think they were criminals because they entered as customers.  No one was paying attention to them and no one noticed anything when they entered.  “I didn’t see what happened after they entered. What I saw was one man pointing a firearm at the shop owner while his friend closed the doors and pointed another firearm at us.  “I thought I was going to die. I was so scared.”  The robbers demanded cash from the shop owner and threatened to shoot them if he did not comply with their demands.  He said the shop owner didn’t hesitate and gave them what they wanted.  The robbers allegedly got away with about R6 000, airtime worth R2 000 and a one-kilogram box of cigarettes.  Mountain Rise police spokesperson Captain Gay Ebrahim confirmed that Chaldin Supermarket was robbed and that cash to the amount of R6 000 was taken as well as airtime and cell phones. No suspects have been arrested at this stage. An identity kit is currently being compiled. The shop owner could not be reached for comment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
