	     President Jacob Zuma recently reshuffled his cabinet, which
saw minister of higher education and training Blade Nzimande bring axed. Now it
seems, like many South Africans losing hope in the ruling party, students also
have a no confidence in the ANC. Yesterday EFF leader Julius Malema took on police minister Fikile
Mbalula, a former ANC Youth League president, after the EFF Student Command
(EFFSC) beat the ANC student command to win the student representative council elections
at Wits University. “@MbalulaFikile You said @WitsUniversity Students always
vote correctly, I should think that this time you are correct. Shapa @WitsEFF,”
Malema tweeted.  EFFSC won the elections with 12 out of 15 seats. “Three seats went to the PYA (Progressive Youth
Alliance)," said Buhle Zuma, senior communications officer at Wits.  The PYA is made up of the African National Congress Youth
League (ANCYL), the Young Communists League and the Muslim Students Association.  The student movement was overjoyed after the results were
released.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
