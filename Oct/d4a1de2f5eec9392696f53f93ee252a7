About 34 endangered species were selected to receive heightened conservation efforts at the Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS) conference that just concluded in Manila. Protecting migratory species poses particular difficulties since they cross borders, including possibly moving to countries with less stringent wildlife protection systems, said Bradnee Chambers, CMS executive secretary. Protection measures "If the species is moving around all of these countries, everybody has to pitch in," he said at the end of the week-long conference. Lions, leopards and chimpanzees were singled out as needing more conservation work. The chimpanzee in particular is at risk as their numbers have dropped sharply in recent years due to habitat loss, the organisers said. The giraffe, which is in decline throughout Africa with fewer than 90 000 animals left in the wild, was also listed. All four of these African mammals were approved by a "wide majority" for additional protection measures, a CMS statement noted.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
