She has spent 558 days as a captive and in her book “558 Days” (also available in Afrikaans) she wrote about her family’s ordeal after they were abducted by al-Qaeda rebels. Yolande’s story speaks of a level of love that few couples will ever experience. It speaks of faith that grows stronger through adversity and of forgiveness that is more powerful than human boundaries. The couple had been in Yemen for four years with two teenage children when Pierre and Yolande were seized by al-Qaeda in 2013. Yolande was released eight months later without ransom after negotiations conducted by Gift of the Givers. They continued working for Pierre’s release, but unfortunately, the rescue attempt by US Navy Seals failed. Yolande will be in Uitenhage on Saturday, October 14th, 09:30 at the Evangelies Gereformeerde Kerk. Tickets are R100 per person or R160 per couple. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
