	     Kenya's journey back to the polls was marred by protest and violence on Thursday.

WATCH Nairobi - Kenya's opposition on Friday slammed plans to try to re-stage elections in its strongholds where violence blocked voting, urging supporters to stay away from a "trap of death". "The first thing we are trying to convey to our people is that (during) the forced repeat election tomorrow, we want to make sure they are not injured... we're telling them to stay away because they might walk into a trap," said Musalia Mudavadi, a leader of the National Super Alliance (NASA) coalition.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
