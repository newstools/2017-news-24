	     Cairo - Egyptian security officials say authorities are stepping up a crackdown on people suspected of homosexuality, arresting a total of 27 over a little more than a week. Speaking on Tuesday, the officials said the 27 arrested since September 25 include a man and a woman picked up by police on Monday and face charges of "debauchery." The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorised to brief the media. Homosexuality is highly taboo in Egypt among Muslims and Christians alike, but it is not explicitly prohibited by law. In practice, authorities prosecute individuals under such charges as "immorality" and "debauchery. The latest crackdown was in response to the raising of the LGBT rainbow flag during a recent concert in Cairo. The crackdown has been condemned by international rights groups. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
