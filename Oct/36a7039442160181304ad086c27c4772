	     Stellenbosch - A father was killed and his son stabbed in the face during a home invasion in Stellenbosch in the early hours of Tuesday morning. According to police sources, two robbers broke into the house at about 03:30 in De Wet Street, Brandwacht. The property is currently being renovated. Brandwacht is one of the country's richest neighbourhoods, 2013 census figures show. According to News24's sources, a couple, their 14-year-old son and a 3-year-old toddler had been asleep at the time of the attack. It is understood that the teenager had heard the intruders' footsteps in the house and tried to fight them off by attacking them with a golf club, and was stabbed in the face. He is currently being treated at a Stellenbosch hospital. The 42-year-old father was knifed to death in his bedroom, ostensibly following a struggle. Police were still at the scene by 07:00 on Tuesday morning. It was not yet clear what had been stolen from the house.
