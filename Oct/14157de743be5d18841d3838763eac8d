	     Nairobi - Kenya's highest profile marathon, due on October 29, has been postponed to late November over fears of political unrest around the country's re-run presidential election expected on October 26. The Nairobi Marathon, a road race which has often been a platform for young Kenyan athletes to launch their international careers, will now be held on November 26. "This revised date is to give runners ample time to participate in both the election and the marathon," race organisers said. The marathon - the only regional road race recognised by the International Association of Athletics Federations - is not the only sport to have been affected by the tense political climate in the country after August's presidential election was annulled by the Supreme Court and a re-run ordered. Last month the International Cricket Council said this October's World Cricket League sixth-round fixture between Kenya and the Netherlands would be moved from Nairobi to South Africa with the match set to be played at East London's Buffalo Park cricket stadium on October 6 and 8. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
