	     COMMUNITY members of Mpharane, Tsolobeng and other villages outside Mount Fletcher blocked the R56 with burning tyres and rocks at a service delivery protest on Monday morning.  Police had to use rubber bullets to disperse them. The angry people want RDP houses, electricity and better roads from government.  A Mpharane community member, Bonang Tsoho, blamed Elundini Local Municipality for failing to deliver proper services. He said people have sent petitions to the municipality, but without any response.  “There are more than 300 households without electricity in Mpharane and people have had enought of empty promises,” said Tsoho.  He pointed fingers at the SAPS who used rubber bullets to disband the protestors, saying that said six community members were injured. The injured protesters were treated at the Mount Fletcher Hospital and released.  SAPS spokesman Captain Raphael Motloung said traffic on the road was disrupted and motorists had to use alternative routes. He confirmed that four people were arrested for public violence and will appear in court soon. He added police will monitor the area until the situation is calm. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
