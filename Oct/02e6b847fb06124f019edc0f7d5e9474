	     Port Elizabeth – An isiXhosa nickname, meaning "saved", is what police have given to the three-day-old baby girl, who was rescued from a bush in Kwadwesi near Uitenhage on Tuesday. In a statement on Friday, Eastern Cape police confirmed that the baby, affectionately called Sindiswa, was "recovering well" and "getting stronger" at Dora Nginza Hospital.  Sindiswa is not her real name. Kwadwesi Station Commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Singapphi Sijako, has been overwhelmed by the number of telephone calls from members of the public who have offered donations of clothing and nappies for the baby girl. "We wish to thank our community for opening their hearts to this young little survivor," Sijako said. Meanwhile, the infant’s 24-year-old mother has been arrested and is expected to remain in custody until she appears in court on Monday. She faces charges of attempted murder and child abandonment. Police spokesperson André Beetge said the mother was arrested after a tip-off from a member of the public. Beetge said she was apprehended at the Kwadwesi taxi rank while attempting to flee. She is expected to appear in the New Brighton Magistrate's Court on Monday.  Motherwell Police Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie thanked members of the public for helping to find the mother.  "[We particularly] wish to thank those members of the community who donated clothing items for the baby girl," Rabie said in a statement. Any donations for the baby can be delivered to the Kwadwesi police station. The donations will be handed over to social workers involved in the case.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
