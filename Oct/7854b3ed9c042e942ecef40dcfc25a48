	     Pretoria – Police arrested two men in connection with the murder of a man in Atteridgeville on Monday. It is believed that the 63-year-old man, whose body was found by a friend, had been assaulted before his house was ransacked, police said on Tuesday. “It is alleged the friend of the victim went to visit him at his place of residence only to find him lying on the floor,” police constable Tumisang Moloto said. Moloto said it appeared that the man had bruises to his neck and pelvic area. Paramedics declared him dead on the scene. The cause of death has not yet been established and police have not yet determined whether any weapons were used in the attack.   “Police followed up the information on the whereabouts of the suspects and they were arrested in Brazaville later during the day,” said Moloto.  “The motive behind the killing is still unknown at this stage. However, the police will investigate circumstances surrounding this incident.” A case of murder has been opened.  The suspects are to appear in court soon. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
