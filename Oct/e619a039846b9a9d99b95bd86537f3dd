	     Warri - Royal Dutch Shell's Nigeria subsidiary says it has lifted the force majeure imposed on Bonny Light crude oil exports a month ago. Company spokesperson Joseph Obari says the force majeure was lifted on Thursday. It was imposed on September 16 after a major pipeline, the Nembe Creek Trunk Line, shut down due to leakages. The line can carry more than 150 000 barrels per day. It and the Trans-Niger Pipeline are the two major pipelines used by Shell Nigeria to evacuate crude oil from the eastern Niger Delta to the Bonny export terminal. Nigeria's crude oil production in recent months has been recovering after the cessation of hostilities by Niger Delta oil militants. The West African nation is one of the continent's leading oil producers. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
