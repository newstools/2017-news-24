- A search for a camper is underway at the Vaal Dam after a Vereeniging man was
reported missing on Saturday morning. NSRI Vaal Dam station commander
Dirk Manten said duty crew were called to assist police in the search for two
fishermen on canoes at a campsite where
two groups of men had been camping and fishing overnight. “While NSRI and police were
searching, it was confirmed that one of the men had returned safely and [the
second] man… remained missing,” he said in a statement. “During an ongoing search
operation the canoe and a life-jacket, believed to belong to the missing man,
was located 9km north-west of the campsite
by the NSRI and we recovered these items which we delivered to SAPS at the campsite.” Both authorities continued an
extensive search but no sign of the missing man had been found. The police’s dive unit has since
taken over the search. Duty crew also responded to
assist police on Friday night at the campsite
after a fisherman on a canoe was reported missing. They stood down after the man was
found safe and their assistance was no
longer required. Manten said strong winds gusting
to 50 knots were experienced in the area since Friday night.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
