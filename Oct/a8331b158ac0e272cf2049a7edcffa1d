	     Durban – A 32-year-old KwaZulu-Natal man who allegedly slit his girlfriend’s throat at a busy North Coast mall appeared briefly in the Umhlali Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. Zakhele Mthembu made national news last week after he apparently followed his girlfriend into the women’s toilet of the newly-constructed Ballito Bay Mall and allegedly slit her throat after an argument. Witnesses had apparently seen Mthembu go into the bathroom and heard screaming a short while later.  A member of the public managed to apprehend Mthembu before he could flee the scene.  He will be kept in custody at Westville Prison until his next appearance in a week's time (November 2). 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
