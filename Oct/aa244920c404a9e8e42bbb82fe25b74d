	     Cape Town – The ANC on Friday officially asked branches to nominate delegates to attend the ANC elective conference in December.  Some 4 723 delegates will be attending the conference to choose the next president of the party and its top leadership, ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe said in a letter to provincial secretaries.   "In terms of rule 10.1.1.1 the number of delegates per branch shall be in proportion to their paid-up membership, provided that each branch in good standing shall be entitled to at least one delegate," Mantashe said.  KwaZulu-Natal will have the most delegates with 870, followed by Mpumalanga with 736.  The Eastern Cape has 648 delegates, Limpopo 643, the North West 538, Gauteng 508 and the Free State 409.  The Western Cape and Northern Cape have the lowest amount of delegates, with 182 and 197 delegates respectively.  "[The delegate numbers are] based on a calculation where a branch with a minimum of 100 members is entitled one delegate and for every additional 250 members the branch is allocated one additional delegate," Mantashe said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
