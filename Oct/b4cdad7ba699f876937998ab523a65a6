THE Pietermaritzburg K9 Unit members arrested two suspects for attempted murder and recovered a stolen vehicle on Saturday, September 23, on the N3 near Merrivale.  KZN SAPS spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said the police were conducting an operation in the area when they spotted a vehicle with five occupants.  “When police instructed them to stop, the suspects allegedly tried to veer the police vehicle off the road.  “The suspect’s vehicle crashed into the pavement and they abandoned their vehicle while shooting at the police,” Mbhele said. She said the suspects fled into bushes and police gave chase.  “Two of the five suspects were arrested­ and taken to hospital under police guard.  “They will be charged and will appear at Howick Magistrate’s Court soon,” she said. Mbhele said during the investigation it was revealed that the vehicle had been stolen during a house robbery at Sdikidikeni area, Intsikeni.  “These suspects will be linked to the Intsikeni incident and will also be profiled to determine if they can be linked to other similar incidents,” she said.                     - Supplied. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
