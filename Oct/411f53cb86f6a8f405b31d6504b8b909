Mayco member for Safety, Security and Social Services says the man was spotted throwing something over the wall of a house in Gamtoos Street when approached by police. “A search of the area revealed an illegal firearm. The suspect – said to be a member of the Dixie Boys gang who is currently out on bail for attempted murder – was arrested on a charge of possession of an illegal firearm.” “This brings the total to 73 the number of illegal firearms Metro Police and Law Enforcement have confiscated in the last 18 months.” Smith says this shows that the Metro Police Gang and Drug Task Team are punching well above their weight range. “Metro Police and the SA police both say that Shotspotter has played a large role in this, as have our information-driven specialised units,” he says.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
