	     Limpopo - An alleged cop killer remains behind bars after appearing in the Louis Trichardt Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. Fhumulani Simali, 30, is facing charges of murder, theft from a vehicle, and assault with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. The matter was postponed to November 1 for a bail application and further investigation. Simali was arrested after allegedly stabbing Warrant Officer Andrew Mudau to death as he attempted to apprehend him on the two charges on Saturday. Mudau, 59, of the Makhado Detectives Unit died in hospital later that day. Officers had followed leads on Simali’s whereabouts, which led them to a house in Louis Trichardt. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the man had become violent when the officer tried to arrest him. Mudau was stabbed multiple times in the chest. Simali was later arrested after being cornered and subdued in the house. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
