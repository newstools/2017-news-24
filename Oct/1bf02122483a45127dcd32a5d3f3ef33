	     Bloemfontein – The partially decomposed body of a six-year-old girl was found under a tree at a dumping site near Phase 5 in Mangaung, Free State police said on Wednesday. Sandisiwe Sintwa was reported missing on Saturday, Colonel Thandi Mbambo said in a statement. Mbabo said it was alleged that, while she was playing with a friend at her home in Chris Hani in Mangaung, the little girl was taken by a man holding a puppy. “No visible injuries could be seen on the body and a post-mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death and also to determine if she was sexually assaulted,” Mbambo said. A case of murder has been opened for further investigation. Anyone with information can contact the investigating officer, Constable Tsietsi Thulo of the Family, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit, on 051 406 4401 or 082 466 5884. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
