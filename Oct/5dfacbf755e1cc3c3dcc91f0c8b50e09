	     Cape Town – Police are searching for two men who robbed a policeman of his service pistol after they repeatedly assaulted him with a hammer in Cape Town, police said on Wednesday. The incident took place in broad daylight at the Woltemade train station in Maitland on Monday morning. CCTV footage of the constable in full uniform being bashed with a hammer, before falling down, is currently doing the rounds on social media. In a 1:04 minute video, the policeman walks behind three school boys into what looks like a corridor. A few steps inside the corridor, a man walking behind the policeman hits him with a hammer and he falls to the ground. The man quickly grabs the policeman while he is still twitching on the floor. Another suspect picks up the hammer and continuously strikes the policeman. Once the two men in white caps manage to wrestle the firearm from the policeman, they flee the scene on foot. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut  confirmed that the policeman had been attacked "at about 08:05 on Monday morning". "Two suspects assaulted a police constable and robbed him of his firearm. No one has been arrested as yet," he said, adding that the matter was still under investigation.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
