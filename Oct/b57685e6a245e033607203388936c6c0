	     Harare - Nothing like ploughing your way through a two-page statement from Zimbabwe’s vice president to take your breath away. That was the experience of one of Zimbabwe’s top news anchors who was caught on air breathing a dramatic sigh of relief as she finished. Watch video below Rumbi Takawira is known for her slick presentations – and she’s the reason, so it’s rumoured, that a fair few Zimbabweans endure the nightly hour-long broadcast. On Wednesday night’s bulletin, she was forced to plough her way through a two-page-long statement from Vice President Phelekezela Mphoko, who was directly attacking his co-vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa in what are clearly deepening factional fights within President Robert Mugabe’s ruling party. Her dramatic gasp for air was caught and posted to Twitter by local media watchdog @ZimMediaReview. “Rumbi Takawira gasps for air after reading through VP Mpokho’s entire, rambling statement. Tough job!” said the watchdog. It tweeted a link to a video clip.  In his verbose statement, Mphoko had accused Mnangagwa of undermining Mugabe by insisting he was poisoned at a ruling party rally in August. The rare on-camera slip caused some mirth on social media: “That gasp of air though! I wonder how often this happens at ZBC off-camera,” commented @tinasheontweets “ZBC is hectic,” said @lizweC END Watch: ZBC newscaster Rumbi Takawira gasps for air after reading through VP Mphoko's entire, rambling statement.
