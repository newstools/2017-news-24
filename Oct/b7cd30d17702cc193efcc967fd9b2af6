Nhlanhla Zungu was arrested for the illegal possession of a firearm on Saturday and was released from police custody on Monday. Zungu was in possession of a Norinco pistol that he could not produce a firearm licence for. However, according to SACP deputy secretary in the region Zoliswa Nyide, police had still refused to let Zungu go after his wife allegedly produced the licence. "His wife came with the licence but the police didn't listen. We even brought a lawyer but that did not work. The local police told us it was hard for them to ignore instructions from national police." Police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker denied that Zungu's permit was produced. "A permit was never produced to police and despite many attempts by police, no person could produce the firearm permit. The firearm will remain with police as part of our ongoing investigation into this matter." Naicker added that police would ascertain why the National Prosecuting Authority had failed to proceed with Zungu's matter. "The suspect was taken to court yesterday [Monday] morning, however, the prosecutor refused to enrol the case. We are currently awaiting the docket from court to establish why the prosecutor refused to enrol the matter." Nyide claimed there was a political agenda behind Zungu's arrest. "This is happening as we are moving toward [the ANC] national conference. Also what we are saying as SACP is that there are many blunders within the department of police. It is not the first time they have arrested innocent people, failing to get the real criminals."  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
