	     Pretoria – The suspension of the director-general of the
Department of Home Affairs Mkuseli Apleni has been overturned. He was suspended in September. Last week Tuesday, President Jacob Zuma reshuffled his
Cabinet, which momentarily delayed and confused the court as Apleni now has a
new boss. Judge Hans Fabricius had learnt that Zuma had announced a
Cabinet reshuffle which could have a direct impact on the urgent application he
was dealing with.  Apleni was challenging his suspension, with the crux of his
argument being that it is only the president who can either suspend or dismiss
him; alternatively the president needs to confer those powers to the minister
of home affairs. He wanted his suspension declared invalid and for him to be
reinstated. The reshuffle threw a curveball at the court as the official
responsible for suspending Apleni was former minister of home affairs Hlengiwe
Mkhize, who has now been appointed as the minister of higher education and
training in place of Blade Nzimande. The new home affairs minister is Ayanda Dlodlo, who was
previously the minister of communications. During court proceedings, Fabricius asked the legal teams
representing the Department of Home Affairs, the Presidency and Apleni, if the
reshuffle wouldn't render many of their arguments moot.   Apleni judgment delivered this morning. He will return to office immediately @IOL @pretorianews pic.twitter.com/onJO8tkPu3 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
