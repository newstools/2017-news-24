	     Maseru -  A former military commander in Lesotho has been charged with murdering a police official during a purported 2014 attempt to topple the government of the small African mountain kingdom. Tlali Kamoli on Monday also is charged with attempted murder for the 2014 bombings of three homes, including an attack that authorities had said was an attempt to assassinate Prime Minister Thomas Thabane. Thabane fled to South Africa after the alleged assassination attempt, but he returned and his party won elections this year, restoring him to the top post. Kamoli's replacement, Lieutenant General Khoantle Motsomotso, was killed last month in a gunfight with two rival officers who also died. The two officers involved in Motsomotso's death were said to be supporters of Kamoli. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
