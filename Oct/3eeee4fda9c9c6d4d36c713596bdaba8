	     Johannesburg – Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was released from Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg on Friday morning, the Mandela family has confirmed.  "I’m pleased to say that the minor surgery I was admitted for went very well. I am feeling well and I also found time to rest while I was at the hospital," Madikizela-Mandela said in a statement.  Family spokesperson Victor Dlamini said, "she was admitted last week Tuesday for a minor knee surgery. She could have left the hospital last week, but the doctors decided to keep her in the hospital so that she could avoid moving around after surgery." Dlamini added that Madikizela-Mandela had fully recovered and was given time to rest and recuperate while in hospital.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
