	     Cairo - A lawyer says Egyptian police have arrested seven Nubians who were protesting outside a courthouse against a judge's decision to extend the detention of relatives and friends who were also detained for protesting. Moustafa al-Hassan said on Wednesday the arrests took place the day before in the southern city of Aswan. He says police used tear gas to disperse the protest. The judge on Tuesday extended by 15 days the detention of 25 Nubians arrested in September for staging a peaceful protest to demand that they be allowed to return to their ancestral land around the man-made lake behind the Aswan High Dam. Nubians, an ethnic minority, trace their roots back to an ancient civilisation in southern Egypt. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
