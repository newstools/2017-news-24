	     Johannesburg – Authorities are conducting an ongoing search for a diver who went missing on Sunday in Bantry Bay, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said on Sunday.  NSRI spokesperson Luke van Riet said the diver had gone missing after a dive with his brother.  "It appears that, while the brothers were exiting the water after a dive in rough sea conditions, the missing man’s brother was able to get out of the surf onto rocks, but his brother, a 32-year-old male from Grassy Park, went missing." Van Riet said bystanders had raised the alarm, prompting the sea rescue craft Rotarian Schipper to respond.  Van Riet said rescue swimmers, together with a host of emergency services and a police dive unit, conducted an extensive search, but could find no sign of the missing man.  According to Van Riet, the family of the missing man was being assisted by authorities. He said police had opened an investigation.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
