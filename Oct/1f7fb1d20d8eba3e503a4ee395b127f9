	     Johannesburg – The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has assured social grant beneficiaries that Sassa payment cards, which expire on December 31, will continue to operate beyond their expiry dates. "The matter has been dealt with and resolved with all parties concerned, namely Cash Paymaster Services (CPS), Payments Association of South Africa (Pasa) and MasterCard," the agency said in a statement on Monday. The agency issued the statement after social grant beneficiaries expressed uncertainty over whether their cards would work after reaching their expiry dates. However, Sassa confirmed that the cards would be accepted at all retailers, irrespective of the expiry dates printed on them. "The reason for this is that the technology and the acceptance of the card into the National Payment System (NPS) requires no enhancement, because this has already been addressed," Sassa said. Sassa also reiterated that cards bearing the colours of the South African flag remained official and "cannot be changed for any other card". Sassa CEO Pearl Bhengu said it had been agreed in negotiations that Pasa would issue a notice to all retailers "informing them to accept the Sassa card, as it will still function properly irrespective of the expiry date printed on it". "The agency is aware that the expiry date on the card coincides with the period when most parents will be preparing to take their children back to school. Sassa would never cause any families or children to be impacted negatively by this issue," she said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
