	     The so-called 'dagga couple', Julian Stobbs and Myrtle Clarke, are back in Pretoria High Court in a bid to have marijuana legalised. Watch. WATCH Johannesburg – The Constitutional Court has given so-called "dagga couple", Myrtle Clarke and Julian Stobbs, leave to intervene in a case before it that calls for the legalisation of the use, cultivation and distribution of marijuana.  The pair has been in and out of the North Gauteng High Court in their attempt to secure the legalisation of dagga.  Through their advocate, Don Mahon, they previously argued that the law banning the adult use and sale of dagga was irrational because alcohol‚ which they claim is more harmful‚ has not been banned.  They wanted the court to instruct Parliament to make new laws to reflect this. Now they have been given an opportunity to formally argue their views in the Constitutional Court when they join a case that stems from the Western Cape High Court.  Earlier in 2017, the High Court found that the cultivation and private use of dagga should be legalised.  The case goes to court on November 7.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
