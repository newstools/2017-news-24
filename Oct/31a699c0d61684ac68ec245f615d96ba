	     Bulawayo – A Zimbabwean veterinary worker, who caught his wife in bed with his friend, has been arrested after burning him to death with a "red hot iron", says a report.  According to the state owned Chronicle newspaper, Thomson Tshuma, 43, found his wife Nomthandazo Ncube in bed with his friend Chrispen Musa after arriving home unexpectedly.  Tshuma, who stayed at Mhlotshana Veterinary Quarters in Plumtree, was not asked to plead and was remanded in custody until his trial on November 2. Prosecutor, Zorodzai Pengapenga, said that the incident happened on October 11 after the accused came home earlier than expected from Matobo district where he had gone for business.  Pengapenga said that when Tshuma got home he found his friend naked behind the door. Stabbed multiple times Tshuma then used a "red hot dehorning iron" to torture the deceased.  Musa died two days later from severe burn wounds at the United Bulawayo hospital.  This reportedly was not the first time a man killed a cheating wife's lover.  According to New Zimbabwe.com, in 2015, a 37-year-old man was arrested for stabbing a prophet he suspected of having an affair with his wife and also attempted to kill her for "cheating on him". Obert Manenji stabbed himself on the chest but fled away when he saw a man advancing to rescue his wife.  The suspect then proceeded to the prophet’s house where he reportedly poured acid on the man of the cloth before stabbing him multiple times with a knife.  The prophet died at the Parirenyatwa hospital on admission.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
