	     Benghazi - A spokesperson for Libyan forces in the country's east says suspected Islamic State militants have attacked a security checkpoint, killing two people. Faisal Ahbale, a spokesperson for the self-styled Libyan national army led by Field Marshal Khalifa Hifter, says three additional troops were wounded in the Wednesday attack. He says the militants looted weapons and ammunition and left several vehicles burning. Speaking from the eastern coastal city of Ajdabia, he says the suspected ISIS fighters desecrated the bodies after the attack, which took place 60km to the south. This attack comes after a relatively peaceful summer in Libya, where Hifter's forces have taken control of most of the country's east and some southern areas. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement circulated on social media. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
