	     Cairo - Egypt says archaeologists have discovered the upper part of royal obelisk dating back more than 4 000 years. The Antiquities Ministry said on Wednesday the unearthed part of the obelisk is made of pink granite and is about 2.5m high. The entire obelisk is believed to have been at least twice as high. Archaeologists say the obelisk, which was found in the Saqqara area outside Cairo, belongs to the mother of King Pepi II of the 6th dynasty, who ascended the throne at the age of six. One side of the obelisk bore an ancient Egyptian cartouche with hieroglyphic scripts. Excavation work is underway to unearth other parts of the obelisk. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
