	     Port Elizabeth - A man believed to be behind two brutal hammer attacks which left three people dead in as many days is expected to appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court on Monday. The 21-year-old suspect was arrested on Wednesday at the Paterson Magistrates Court where he appeared in a separate burglary case. The man is believed to be behind the brutal murders of an elderly couple, both victims in their 70s, who was attacked in their Schoenmakerskop home on September 26. He has also been linked to the murder of Tyrone Plaatjies, 49, who was bludgeoned to death in a house robbery on September 23 at the Forrest Hills cemetery caretaker’s quarters. Police spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu said Plaatjies and his friend were asleep inside his caravan when two men entered at about 23:45. “One was armed with a hammer and started assaulting the two men. They searched the caravan and took R50 cash, a cellphone and a vehicle belonging to the deceased. Plaatjies succumbed to his injuries while on his way to hospital,” Naidu confirmed. The suspect faces three murder charges and two of aggravated robbery, and the possibility of the man being linked to other robbery cases in Summerstrand and Humewood is being investigated. More arrests related to the murders are expected, Naidu added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
