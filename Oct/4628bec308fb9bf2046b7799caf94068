	       Nairobi - Polling stations were closing in Kenya after a repeat presidential election that was marred in some areas by clashes between police and opposition protesters who say the vote isn't credible. The official closing time for the voting sites was 17:00 (1400GMT) on Thursday, though election officials have said that polling stations that opened late because of what they called "logistical challenges" can stay open later. Some polling stations in opposition areas didn't open at all because of security problems. Election officials say voting in some areas that were affected by the political tension and unrest will be delayed until Saturday.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
