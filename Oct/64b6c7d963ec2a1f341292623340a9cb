An official in the prime minister's office says Defense Minister Abdirashid Abdullahi Mohamed has resigned, citing lack of consultations on issues related to his ministry. The official says army chief Gen. Mohamed Ahmed Jimale has also submitted his resignation to the president. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to reporters. There have been reports of a rivalry between the two outgoing military leaders. Somalia in recent weeks has seen an increase in attacks by al-Shabaab extremists, who have overrun several army positions. Al-Shabaab is the focus of stepped-up US military efforts, including drone strikes. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
