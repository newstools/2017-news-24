	     Addis Ababa - Witnesses in Ethiopia say at least 10 people are dead after security forces fired on angry protesters in the restive Oromia region. One resident says the killings occurred around midday on Thursday in the town of Ambo. Another resident says gunshots could be heard since morning. The residents spoke on condition of anonymity because of fear of retaliation. The town has seen multiple demonstrations since anti-government protests erupted in Ethiopia in 2015 and caused a months-long state of emergency that was lifted earlier this year. Ethiopia's government spokesperson was not immediately available to comment. A spokesperson for the Oromia region, Addisu Kittesa, says in a Facebook post that "lives were lost and people wounded." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
