	       Nairobi - Kenya's president is accusing opposition leader Raila Odinga of causing the country to waste millions of dollars on a new election that Odinga now says he won't contest. Odinga has withdrawn from the October 26 vote, saying the election commission has not made needed changes to avoid the "illegalities" cited in the nullified August vote. President Uhuru Kenyatta said on Twitter that "what is the justice in the act of withdrawing from an election after causing Kenyans to use Kenya shillings 12 billion?" ($116 million) Kenyatta says the vote will go ahead, while the election commission says it is meeting with its legal team on the way forward.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
