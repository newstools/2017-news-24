	     Cape Town – More than a thousand bullets were discovered buried in a yard in Hanover Park, a gang hot spot about 17km outside of the Cape Town city centre. While police have not officially confirmed the number of bullets found, sources with close knowledge of the matter said more than a thousand were discovered. On Tuesday police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut said police officers searched a home in Lansport Road at about 17:00 on Monday. He said a 17-year-old girl was arrested for "the illegal possession of a large quantity of 9mm and shotgun rounds which were buried in the backyard". An hour before this arrest, a man, 27, was arrested in Hanover Park for allegedly being in possession of tik worth R20 000. Traut said the circumstances around both cases were under investigation. He said the suspects would appear in the Athlone Magistrate's Court once formally charged.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
