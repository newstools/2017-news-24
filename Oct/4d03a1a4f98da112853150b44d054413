	     Cairo - An Egyptian court has referred the case of 13 defendants accused on terrorism charges to the country's top religious authority, the Grand Mufi, for a non-binding opinion on whether they can be potentially executed as the prosecution seeks. The Giza Criminal Court said on Sunday the men were members of the militant group Ajnad Misr, or Soldiers of Egypt, which has claimed responsibility for several attacks since the 2013 military overthrow of an elected Islamist leader. The men are accused of killing six security personnel and the attempted murder of 100 others in a campaign of bombings and attacks on police stations and state institutions. The verdict in the case can be appealed, and the judge may rule independently of the Mufti. The verdict is set for December 7. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
