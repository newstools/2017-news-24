	     Cape Town - Two suspects appeared in the Bellville Regional Court on Monday following the kidnapping and murder of a businessman, who was reported missing in Rondebosch. Robin Kemper, the managing director of Infovest, was reported missing by his wife on Tuesday night. Police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said two suspects were arrested on a charge of kidnapping after being questioned. Kemper’s decapitated body was found under a bridge in Touws River, on the edge of the Great Karoo, on Friday at 11:00. The National Prosecuting Authority’s Western Cape spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila confirmed Gary Peckham, 37, and Hundra Wallendorf, 32, made a brief appearance in the dock on Monday. The matter was postponed to November 24 for a formal bail application.  "They are charged with murder and further charges may be added at a later stage," he said. Justin Wheatley, Chief Executive of StatPro Group, of which Infovest is a South African subsidiary, in a statement said the "senseless tragedy" had left them "numb with shock and disbelief". "Robin, who was a good friend of mine and many people across StatPro, was also very well known throughout the South African investment management community. As a successful entrepreneur, he founded several businesses and was much admired and respected," he said. Wheatley said Kemper was well loved by a large circle of friends. "We mourn his loss deeply – he will be missed very much." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
