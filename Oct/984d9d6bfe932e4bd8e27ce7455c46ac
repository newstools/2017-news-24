	     Johannesburg - A tour guide died of a heart attack while transporting a group of tourists in Plettenberg Bay, the National Sea Rescue Institute said on Sunday. "Sadly after all efforts to resuscitate the man were exhausted, he was declared deceased," said Robbie Gibson, the area’s deputy station commander, in a statement. The NSRI was called to a parking area at the Robberg Nature Reserve on Friday afternoon, where they found the man – aged 50 and who was from Knysna – who had collapsed from a suspected heart attack. Despite efforts to resuscitate the man, he was declared dead on the scene. "Sincere condolences are conveyed to family and friends of the man," said Gibson. The tourists on the bus were also given trauma counselling.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
