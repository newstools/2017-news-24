	     Beni - A Democratic Republic of Congo police spokesperson says at least two people, a police officer and citizen, have been killed in clashes between police and protesters in eastern DRC. Col. Pierrot Mwanamputu said the two died early on Monday amid demonstrations in Goma to protest President Joseph Kabila's continued rule and the delay of elections. The protesters are demanding that Kabila step down at the end of the year if new elections are not held. North Kivu commissioner Gen. Nyembo Placide said investigations are underway to determine who organised the march. DRC has seen widespread anger over Kabila's extended stay in power after his mandate ended in December and elections were delayed. The US has warned that DRC will not have the support of the international community if elections are not held in 2018. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
