	     Johannesburg – No retirement package was approved for former national police commissioner Riah Phiyega, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula said on Saturday. Mbalula was responding to a Parliamentary question asked by DA member Dianne Kohler Barnard.  She had asked if a retirement package was approved for Phiyega, and if not, if one was being negotiated. "No retirement package was approved for former National Police Commissioner, Ms Riah Phiyega. General Phiyega was appointed, as contemplated in section 7(1) of the South African Police Service Act, 1995 for a period of five years.  "The term of office of General Phiyega expired on 11 June 2017, and she was paid the normal service termination benefits associated with the termination of a contract of service in the Public Service," Mbalula said in a reply released on Friday. 'I am not a killer' He also said the package was not being negotiated for future sign off. Phiyega was the only commissioner to complete her five-year term, despite her suspension on full pay in October 2015. She was suspended following the Claassen Board of Inquiry into the Marikana massacre for her role in the lead-up to the deaths of more than 30 striking miners in 2012. On June 14, three days after her term ended, she vowed to clear her name in the shooting fallout from the Lonmin wage dispute that led to the deaths. "[I am] branded as the cause of the killing which I am not – I am not a killer. If there has been a systems failure, let judges say so. It cannot be that I caused this because that is the narrative that is out there," she told News24. She launched a review of the board of inquiry findings in January.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
