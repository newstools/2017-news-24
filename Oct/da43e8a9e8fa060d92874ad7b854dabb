	     Harare – Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF Youth Secetary, Kedzanayi Chipanga, has urged young people to preserve President Robert Mugabe's legacy. This amid reports that the veteran leader has been invited to an international festival of youth and students in Russia next week, says a report.  According to the state owned Herald newspaper, Mugabe was expected to speak at the October 15 festival alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin. Chipanga said Mugabe was being recognised for his anti-imperialist views.  He added that it was now the task of young people to carry on with President Mugabe’s legacy.  He said: "It is now our responsibility as young people to maintain this legacy." The president of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Nikos Papadimitriou, who is from Russia, was among regional youth leaders who visited Mugabe in Harare last week.  President Mugabe is famed for his love of foreign travel and has in the past attended a youth summit where he was the only head of state, say reports. Mugabe was reported to have spent more time outside the country this year than in it. Independent press reports said by late May he’d covered more than 145 000km and spent 250 hours in the air.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
