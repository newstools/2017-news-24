	     Cape Town – A 60-year-old man was arrested in Mitchells Plain on Friday morning for allegedly raping several minors, Western Cape police said. Mitchells Plain Crisis Forum coordinator Joanie Fredericks said the man was involved in the rape of six girls who are his granddaughters.  Fredericks said the man was arrested with help of the forum.  "Our battle to rid our communities from these monsters continues," Fredericks told News24.  Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said the circumstances surrounding the incident are at a "sensitive stage" and could therefore not provide further information.  The man is expected to appear in the Mitchells Plain Magistrate's Court once charged, Rwexana said.     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
