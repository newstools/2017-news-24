	     Berlin - German police have canceled a workshop designed to help Egyptian security officials monitor extremist websites for fear they may use the skills against other groups. Germany has provided significant material and technical assistance to Egypt in recent years to help combat extremist groups and people smugglers, despite concerns about the Egyptian government's human rights record. The measures were meant to include training for Egyptian Interior Ministry officials in Cairo on Internet crimes, including monitoring websites that could be misused by terrorists to spread extremist ideas and prepare terror attacks. A German government's reply on Monday to questions from Left Party lawmakers, obtained by The Associated Press, says the workshop was cancelled because some of the knowledge and skills "could also be used to pursue other groups." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
