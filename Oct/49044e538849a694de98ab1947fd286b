	     Nairobi - The US ambassador to Kenya has called for an end to attacks on electoral officials ahead of a repeat election scheduled for Thursday in this East African nation. Speaking on behalf of a group of foreign ambassadors, Robert F. Godec said on Monday that the electoral commission had addressed many concerns about its operations since the Supreme Court nullified an August 8 vote because of what it called irregularities and illegalities. Godec is appealing to Kenyans to "allow the best possible election," though he says he and his colleagues from other embassies recognise that opposition supporters have the right not to vote. The main opposition group, led by Raila Odinga, has said it will boycott the new vote. Mobs attacked electoral commission centres in parts of western Kenya last week, disrupting training for electoral officials ahead of the vote.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
