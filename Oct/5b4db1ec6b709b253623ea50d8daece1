	     Kokstad - When the Umkomaas River in Kokstad overflowed on Tuesday, the fire and rescue team helped people to cross it and municipal graders diverted water from below the bridge. Thomekile Ngodwana, a Kokstad firefighter supervisor warned people not to cross flooded rivers. He said people who live in low-lying areas must be watchful of heavy rain.  “No one was hurt when the Umkomaas River overflowed as many were helped by fire and rescue vehicles to cross it,” said Ngodwana.  The bridge over the river is used by people going from Kokstad to Bongweni, but due to it overflowing they had to use alternative routes.  Ngodwana said their team worked throughout Tuesday night to put out small fires that were made by homeless people in the town.  A man, who drowned in the Mzintlava River, was reported by the fire and rescue team as they searched for him from Tuesday night, but did not find his body.  SAPS spokesman Captain Dunisani Ncongo said no case has been opened for the drowned man.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
