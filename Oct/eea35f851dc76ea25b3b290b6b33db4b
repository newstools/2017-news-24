	     Mogadishu - Somalia's president is urging the long-fractured nation to "unite as politicians and public" to fight the extremist group al-Shabaab after the country's deadliest attack. Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed spoke to thousands who marched through Mogadishu and rallied at a city stadium. Saturday's massive truck bombing killed more than 300 people and wounded close to 400. Scores are said to remain missing. Mohamed says they were "unfairly massacred."
