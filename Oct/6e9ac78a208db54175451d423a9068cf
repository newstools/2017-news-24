WATCH Carltonville - Rescue operations are currently underway at the AngloGold Ashanti Maponeng mine in Carltonville, in the western part of Gauteng, for a miner who has been trapped since Saturday. AngloGold mine spokesperson Chris Nthite said on Wednesday that a series of seismic events occurred at the mine in the early hours of Saturday, resulting in the death of a miner. Nthite said the man was a winch operator. A second miner was injured and is in a stable condition in hospital. He said operating teams were hard at work to rescue the last trapped miner. "A recovery operation, comprising a number of proto teams including those from AngloGold Ashanti and from its peers’ mines in the region are safely working through challenging ground conditions to reach our colleague, whose condition is unknown at this stage," he said.

Nthite said the third miner was trapped around 3.8km underground, with the mine being just over 4km deep. When asked the ages of the miners, Nthite said: "It’s company policy not to publicly disclose names or any biographical information of employees." Nthite said AngloGold Ashanti is providing the necessary support to the two families through this difficult period. All mining operations had since been suspended. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
