	     Johannesburg – Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has granted concessions for matric pupils who arrived late for their final exams on Monday, as a result of delays caused by Black Monday protests, the department has confirmed.  "All learners who arrived late were allowed into examination rooms at different centres in Tshwane and Sedibeng areas, even those who accessed centres beyond the one hour cut-off time. It is important to note that some learners were also allowed to write at alternative centres," a statement read.  The department added that most of the learners who arrived late were given an opportunity to write their exams.

Administrative prescripts will be invoked for those students, the department said.  "It is in our best interests not to disadvantage our learners for the unfortunate eventuality which is beyond their control. It is regrettable that they had to write this important paper under this tormenting condition," Lesufi said in a statement.
