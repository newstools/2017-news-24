Lenmed’s 11th addition to its group of private hospitals proudly opened its doors to the community of Kimberley and surrounds in July 2017.  “The hospital has managed well since welcoming its first patient, with several theatre cases already completed. My team and I are committed to ensuring that the patient experience at the hospital exceeds expectations,” said the Lenmed Royal Hospital and Heart Centre’s hospital manager, Hector Mackay. Mackay boasts many years of experience in the healthcare industry, with experience as CEO of the hospitals division of a prominent local hospital group together with international industry experience.  Joining him in the management team is Kimberley local Lana Erasmus in the position of nursing services manager. She will continue to support Mackay in forging a success in the running of the hospital to provide exceptional patient care to the public. Erasmus brings with her extensive experience as an intensive care and casualty unit manager. The carefully-planned, state-of-the-art facility will provide general care to the public with its array of medical specialists in the fields of maternity, paediatrics, medical, surgical, intensive care and neonatal intensive care. The facility will also offer procedures through a multitude of theatres and provide 24 hour emergency and outpatient care, as well as deliver supported outsourced services such as radiology, nuclear medicine, pathology and dialysis. The oncology and cardiac units are set to open in November 2017. Lenmed currently manages nine hospitals in South Africa, one in Mozambique and one in Botswana.
