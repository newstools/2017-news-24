The community are in shock as they say it is not common for a woman to commit murder. The boyfriend was living with his young brother and arrived at their house with his new girlfriend, which made his former girlfriend very jealous. “On Saturday morning I heard the man’s old girlfriend in conflict with his new girlfriend and I interfered by calming them down. “The boyfriend was at work when the fight started, but when he got home I told him to try and make peace between the two parties,” said neighbour Lindani Sodlaka. Sodlaka said on the Saturday afternoon he saw the boyfriend walking with his old girlfriend while his new girlfriend was asleep in the house. On Sunday morning, neighbours and Sodlaka saw the boyfriend and his old girlfriend fighting. She allegedly took the glass of a paraffin lamp and stabbed him in the neck, face and arm, and he fell down. She was also injured. Neighbours called an ambulance to take the man and his old girlfriend to a Kokstad hospital, however, he was declared dead hours later. When Fever went to the crime scene the blood outside the house had been covered. SAPS spokesperson Captain Dumisani Ncongo­ confirmed that the man’s girlfriend had been arrested after being released from hospital. The woman has been charged with murder and appeared in Kokstad Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. She was granted R1 000 bail and the case was remanded to October 27 for further investigation.
