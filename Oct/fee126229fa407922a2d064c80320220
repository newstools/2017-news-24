	     Nairobi -  A witness says three people were seriously wounded during opposition protests to push for changes to Kenya's electoral commission before fresh presidential elections. An Associated Press reporter said on Monday that one man was shot and the shooter drove a car that injured two other protesters before driving away. Opposition leader Raila Odinga has called for countrywide protests to urge reforms to the electoral commission ahead of the October 26 election.  The Supreme Court nullified President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election citing illegalities in the August 8 vote and the electoral commission's refusal to allow scrutiny of its computer system.  Justices said by failing to allow the investigation the commission failed to disprove Odinga's claim that hackers infiltrated the servers and altered the vote in favor of President Uhuru Kenyatta. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
