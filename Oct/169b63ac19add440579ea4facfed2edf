	       Nairobi - Kenya's main opposition group says its leaders have told Western diplomats that it won't participate in an election re-run planned for Thursday because "it doesn't serve the country's interest." Musalia Mudavadi, campaign chairman of the opposition National Super Alliance, said in a statement Monday that the Kenyan electoral commission is not ready "to conduct free, fair and credible elections." The opposition camp, led by Raila Odinga, has previously made similar comments despite President Uhuru Kenyatta's insistence on proceeding with the vote, which was scheduled after the Supreme Court nullified an August 8 election because of what it said were illegalities and irregularities. Kenyatta had been declared the winner in the earlier vote. Mudavadi said Monday's meeting was held with top diplomats from the United States, the European Union, Britain, Norway and Denmark at the request of the embassies.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
