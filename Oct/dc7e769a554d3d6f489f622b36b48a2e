	     Springs – A man’s body was retrieved from a grain silo on a farm outside Springs, Johannesburg on Tuesday morning, police confirmed on Wednesday. The body was that of a farmworker, who had been operating a conveyer belt along with a fellow farmworker at Rowan Feed farm just off the R555 at about 08:00. “The other [worker] went outside and when he came [back], he heard screaming and noticed [his] co-worker sinking and went to stop the machine that operates the belt. He called for help, paramedics and firefighters,” police said in a statement. ER24 was alerted just after 09:00 and dispatched paramedics to the scene. “Upon inspection, paramedics found that some of the workers had already begun to empty the silo of grain, where the man lay trapped,” ER24’s Russel Meiring said. Although emergency services managed to retrieve the body after 13:00, the 28-year-old man succumbed to his injuries and was declared dead, ER24 said. Police have opened an inquest docket for further investigation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
