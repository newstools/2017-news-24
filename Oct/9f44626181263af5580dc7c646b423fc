	     Lome - Opposition supporters in Togo are defying government restrictions on protests to demand the president's resignation.

While the government has agreed to bring in the rule, the opposition is skeptical about whether it will be applied retrospectively. They suspect President Faure Gnassingbe will be allowed to run for office twice more. Watch a report from AlJazeera here. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
