Motsumi was removed as councillor with immediate effect, ANC Johannesburg spokesperson Jolidee Matongo said in a statement. Matongo said the committee met on September 26 to discuss the allegations. He said during the meeting Motsumi was given an opportunity to present his case, however, after deliberations it was decided that his actions were "morally and ethically" unacceptable. Tarnishes image "This was after allegations of the illegal sale of two portions of land were brought to the attention of the ANC," Matongo said. The sale of the land involved amounts of R50 000 and R80 000, he said. "The allegations against councillor Motsumi go against his undertaking to observe discipline. The allegations have a huge potential to tarnish the name of the ANC and bring the organisation into disrepute". Matongo called upon councillors to "desist from conduct that tarnishes the image of the ANC". He also said residents should report any wrongdoing on the part of councillors. "We will not shy away from disciplining any councillor of the ANC should they be found guilty of an offence". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
