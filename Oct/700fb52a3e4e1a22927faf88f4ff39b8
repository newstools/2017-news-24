At the tender age of six it happened . . . and it’s still so fresh in my mind, as if it happened yesterday. My molester is on my dad's side of the family. He was staying with us while he finished high school. The day it happened, I remember wearing a floral dress. He molested me and told me not to tell anyone – which wasn’t hard for me as I've always felt alone in this world. I got used to being by myself, and protecting myself. However, the molestation affected me really badly – so much so I didn’t want any male near me, even in my teens when your hormones are supposed to be out of control. When I started dating it was because of peer pressure, but I secretly hated it. When a guy would invite me over his place, I'd break up with him. Being a teenager, my sexual abuse affected me the most at this stage too, I was angry at my parents for not protecting me. My mom never understood why I was always angry. I also had sleepless nights because I was afraid if I fell asleep that helpless little girl I'd dream of would come back to haunt me. My marks were dropping to the point where my maths teacher was so concerned and asked to see my parents. The day my mom and maths teacher met I broke down and confessed because I was tired of keeping this hurtful secret. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
