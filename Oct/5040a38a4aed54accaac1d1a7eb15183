	     Port Elizabeth - Protest action by people wearing Economic Freedom Fighters T-shirts, led to the closure of Shoprite's doors at the Greenacres shopping centre in Port Elizabeth on Saturday. Police spokesperson, Colonel Priscilla Naidu, said roughly 100 EFF members had stormed their way into Shoprite at around 11:30. “Public Order Policing was quick to respond and managed to close the doors. Some protesters who were already inside were ushered out of the centre,” she said.  Naidu said the protesters then re-grouped and marched to Checkers, which is also in the centre.  “Police managed to close the doors and the protestors went out to the car park,” she said. Naidu said the police then had to use stun grenades to disperse the protestors.  According to reports, the protestors were unhappy about students not being able to use their National Student Financial Aid Scheme funds at the group, as well as working conditions and the links of the Shoprite-Checkers group to so-called white monopoly capital. Naidu said one person had been arrested for intimidation.  She said the protestors had promised they would return to the centre on Sunday, and said police would be stationed at the shopping centre. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
