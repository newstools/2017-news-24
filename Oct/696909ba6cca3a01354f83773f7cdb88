	     A Kempton Park family hasn’t lost hope of finding their missing relative after seven years. Guan Odendaal went missing in the suburb of Rhodesfield when he was 18 years old. According to his younger sister, Biance Scheun, he’d told his grandmother that he was going to see someone in town and never returned. She explains that she and her brother didn’t live together after their parents divorced. She stayed with their father and Guan with their mother, both in Kempton Park.  A missing person’s case was opened at the time but when Biance called in 2016 to get the case number, she was told the file had gone missing and she opened a new one. Biance, who now lives in Cape Town with her husband, says the family is still praying for Guan’s safe return. “It’s hectic because there’s not a day you don’t think about him. You’re trying your best to find him, stressing where he is – does he have food, does he have a place to sleep? But we’re just hoping and praying he’ll appear someday, hopefully soon.” She says she doesn’t recall her brother showing any signs of being unhappy or depressed.  She told the Kempton Express that when he went missing, Guan was about 1,6 m tall and of average weight with green eyes and short ash-blonde hair.  The newspaper quoted her as saying, “He has an L-shaped scar between his right eye and nose and his left ear is chipped.” “Even if he’s not ready to talk to us, if he can just let us know he’s fine,” she pleaded. She urged anyone with information to contact her on 079-146-9215.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
