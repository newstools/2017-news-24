	     Durban – DA MP Tarnia Baker died in a car accident near Port Shepstone in KwaZulu-Natal on Friday afternoon, the party's leader Mmusi Maimane said. Baker, 50, was in Ugu District Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal where she was conducting an oversight visit as a member of the portfolio committee on water and sanitation. Maimane said Baker was a committed MP, a wonderful and warm person, and a devoted mother and wife. "I have been in contact with Tarnia's husband and have conveyed the deep condolences of the entire DA family on their sad loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this time," he said in a statement. "We will continue the hard work that Tarnia lived so passionately for, but her presence and contribution will be sorely missed." Maimane said the DA would honour her memory in Parliament in the appropriate way. Cope parliamentary chief whip Deidre Carter said the party's parliamentary caucus was shocked to learn of Baker's tragic passing. Carter described Baker as an "activist" member of Parliament and hardworking member of the water and sanitation portfolio committee. On Twitter, IFP MP Liezl van der Merwe sent her condolences to the DA. "[Baker] was a kind, lovely soul. Passionate about her work. We'll miss her," Van der Merwe said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
