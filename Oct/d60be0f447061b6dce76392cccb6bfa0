	     Cummingston, Scotland - A waterlogged dog has the coast guard to thank for coming to its rescue in the North Sea. A Maritime and Coastguard Agency helicopter on a training mission spotted the struggling cockerpoo that was being swept out to sea on Sunday morning near Cummingston on Scotland's northeast coast. The crew promptly alerted a rescue boat and then filmed as the pooch was scooped from the cold water. Pet and family were soon reunited on shore. The agency said it all took just a "few minutes" and then the Inverness-based helicopter returned to its training session. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
