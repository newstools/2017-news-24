	     Greytown - A man wanted for the killing of a policeman in Johannesburg was killed in a shoot-out with Kranskop police in the Mambulu area. A second member of the alleged gang was also shot and firearms recovered. There have been a series of armed robberies in Kranskop and Mambulu recently, but the gang have managed to evade police.  Not only were they said to be responsible for the raids on businesses in the area, but they also attacked a teacher, beat him up badly and robbed him of R17 000, which had been collected for a school excursion and transport. On Sunday afternoon, acting on information received, the Kranskop SAPS went to the Mambulu area and sighted the suspects on the back of an open bakkie. Two jumped off and started shooting at the police who returned fire killing them. A further 10 suspects were arrested. The Johannesburg police officer’s firearm was found on the one deceased and a R5 and pistol was also recovered. A number of cellphones, stolen in an armed robbery at Pep, were also recovered. The suspects will appear in the Kranskop Magistrate’s Court this week. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
