	     Nairobi - Kenya’s electoral contenders held talks with the electoral body on Tuesday to firm up preparations for the October 26 repeat presidential elections with the main opposition showing signs of softening its tough stance on major reforms before the repeat vote,  Zimbabwe's Herald newspaper reports. The Supreme Court took the unprecedented step of nullifying the results of the August 8 presidential vote, citing illegalities and irregularities. Presidential candidate Raila Odinga and members of his opposition National Super Alliance (NASA) met with the chair of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) Wafula Chebukati and commissioners of the electoral body before holding talks with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s delegation.  Deputy President William Ruto also attended the talks with the IEBC officials. “Most of the issues have been addressed,” Chebukati told reporters after meeting the presidential candidates to discuss the procurement of key election material. “We shall make changes in line with the law. We shall also make public all the contracts with the suppliers,” he added. The electoral body and its suppliers for the material used during the nullified polls have been under intense public pressure. “NASA had a lot of issues called irreducible minimums. Most of them have been resolved by IEBC. In two days time, IEBC will publish agreements reached on election preparation.  "Jubilee has no issues. They want the election on October 26,” Chebukati said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
