IN a hotly contested by-election in Endumeni last Wednesday the IFP retained the seat it had won from the ANC in the August 2016 elections.  New councillor Thabani Penuel Mlotshwa won the ward with 1 582 votes to the ANC’s Mathula Innocent Nkosi who obtained 1 308 votes - the EFF candidate got 111 votes and the National Freedom Party candidate obtained seven votes. The vacancy in Endumeni Ward 3 occurred when the IFP sacked its councillor S. Zitha accusing him of colluding with the ANC to undermine the IFP administration.  The win was with a reduced margin – IFP won 52.59% of votes cast compared to 60.17% in last year’s election.Voter turnout was 66.20%. The by-election was crucial to both parties with the result deciding whether the IFP would continue to run the Endumeni Municipality. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
