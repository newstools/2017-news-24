IN the Greytown Gazette September 20, an appeal was published for financial assistance for Bayanda Ngubane, who has been selected to take part in a U15 rugby tour to Argentine, the cost of which is R40 000 per player, which his family is unable to afford. There has been some much appreciated donations but more is needed. The Greytown Gazette therefore is publishing the following from Bayanda which says it all: “I am a 15-year-old young boy born and raised in a rural area called Entembisweni. I studied Grade 1 until 6 in Greytown Junior School. Then in 2015 I was approached by Pelham Senior Primary School to do Grade 7 with them through [a] sports scholarship. “I am currently doing Grade 9 at Maritzburg College through sports/rugby full scholarship, which means the school pays for my school fees, boarding fees, school uniform, stationery and any sports tours that are held anywhere around the country. “I am very passionate about rugby and wish to become one of the Sharks, Springboks and Blitzbokke players one day. In 2015 I was selected to represent KZN Midlands Rugby under 13 A and again selected to be part of KZN Rugby 7s. “At school I participate in A teams for rugby, basketball and athletics. In 2017 I was selected to represent under 15 KZN Midlands Relay, 200 and 100 metres. “Being part of Maritzburg College has really assisted me a lot in both academics and sport. I get professional coaching in both rugby and athletics, over and above I get a chance to showcase my talent and be seen by professional selectors and coaches around the country. “As a young boy from this disadvantaged background, I am unfortunately unable to afford the money that is required in order for me to participate in the Argentina        tour. “I believe if I get a chance to be part with other young boys who will be participating, I will be exposed on an international level as I will be participating with young boys from Argentina and this will also enhance not only my rugby skill, but also my profile. “It is very sad that because of financial constraints I will not be able to advance my skill and by attending the tour I will be representing my community and Maritzburg College and show other young boys that no matter where you come from you are a STAR. “Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.
