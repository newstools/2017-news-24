	     Sonet Barnard, mother of the missing teenager from the West Rand in Johannesburg, is relieved after Mizandri Nagel (16) was located at a friend’s grandmother’s house in Carletonville on the West Rand. Mizandri has been missing since last Thursday afternoon. “I am terribly grateful that I’ve found her and now don’t have to arrange her funeral. Rather a runaway child than a dead child. I am so happy that she was found,” Sonet told YOU over the telephone on Thursday afternoon.  “Mizandri still asked last week Wednesday if she could visit with me. She was at my house the Thursday morning , she’d come to do her washing.” After that she went to visit with friends and then disappeared without a trace.   “When I still hadn’t heard from her on Monday, I started becoming incredibly concerned. She does usually visit with her friends over weekends, but usually returns home by Mondays,” Sonet told us. Sonet explains that Mizandri’s grandmother had given her permission to visit her friend. “That was when Mizandri decided to pack her bags and run away altogether.” “We arrived at the friend’s grandmother’s house with some members of the local police. The police chatted to her and she apologized.” Mizandri is currently safely at home in the care of her grandmother and grandfather who live in Lindhaven in Roodepoort on the West Rand of Johannesburg.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
