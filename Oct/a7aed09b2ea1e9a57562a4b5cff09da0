Nation Nyoka Johannesburg â€“ The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has declined to prosecute a 44-year-old school bus driver for the alleged sexual assault of a 13-year-old pupil earlier this month, due to a lack of evidence.

The driver was arrested on October 20 after a teacher and a pupil reported that he allegedly inappropriately touched a female pupil while she was boarding a bus on October 13 and 16. However, the NPA says it does not have enough evidence to proceed with a case against him. Gauteng NPA spokesperson Phindi Louw told News24: "The NPA declined to prosecute due to the fact that there is no information that suggests any wrongdoing on the side of the bus driver." The Gauteng Education Department has noted the decision. "The department takes note of a decision taken by NPA and understands that there are about four learners who will submit statements to the police. We are hopeful that law enforcement agencies will finalise this matter accordingly," spokesperson Steve Mabona said.
