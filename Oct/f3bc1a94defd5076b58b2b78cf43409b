	     Cape Town – The Huguenot tunnel on the N1 has been closed to heavy vehicles, Western Cape traffic officials say. Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa said the tunnel has been closed to heavy motor vehicles due to a power failure that occurred earlier on Saturday. “We have closed the tunnel to heavy vehicles for the time being, but light vehicles are still being allowed through until further notice,” he said. The Huguenot tunnel runs through the Du Toitskloof mountains between Paarl and Worcester. Africa urged motorists to make use of alternative routes. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
