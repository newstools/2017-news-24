                 Disagrees that he is the only person alive that can remember what happened.  "I have no idea what the attackers' memory is like." Other people (visitors) at house the night or morning of murders? No, Van Breda says.  He also confirms he is right handed. Galloway: Why were no the first witness?

 

 Van Breda: I was given advice by my lawyer

 Susan Galloway is a seasoned State advocate with 25 years'
experience.

 

 Her high-profile cases have included the conviction of taxi
driver Jacob Humphreys. He was sentenced to 20 years behind bars for killing 10
children when a train struck his minibus at the Buttskop level crossing,
Blackheath, in 2010.

 Henri can't explain why he didn't aid Van Breda family

 

 "I wish I did"

 

 "I was too scared"

 Van Breda says he has never seen the axe 

 

 Doesn't dispute the domestic worker's testimony that there
was a similar axe in the house
