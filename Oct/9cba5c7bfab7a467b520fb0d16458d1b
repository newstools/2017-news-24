	     Johannesburg - A security guard who allegedly sexually assaulted at least 87 school girls at a Soweto primary school will not be applying for bail, the Protea Magistrate's Court heard on Wednesday afternoon. The short, elderly man, walked into a packed court room in Soweto covering his face with a blue jacket. His legal counsel, Dennis Mabasa told the court that his client would not be applying for bail.During his last appearance on October 18, State prosecutor Cheryl Slack asked for the matter to be postponed for further investigations to be conducted, including an identity parade.
