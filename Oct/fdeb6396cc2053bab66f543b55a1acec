Her arrest at Cape Town International Airport on Friday, September 29, followed an intelligence-driven operation by anti-smuggling officers attached to the border police unit, said Captain FC van Wyk. They were informed that two passengers, flying in on TAAG Angola Airlines from Sao Paolo, might be in possession of drugs.

The bullets, her passport, itinerary, cellphone, bag tag and hotel reservation were handed in as exhibits. Her personal belongings were also booked in. Van Wyk said the woman would appear in the Bellville Magistrate's Court once charged.
