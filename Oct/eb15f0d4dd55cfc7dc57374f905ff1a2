	     Lusaka - Zambian President Edgar Lungu will no longer attend traditional ceremonies as they are dividing the country, according to a report in the Lusaka Times. ZANIS reports that President Lungu explained that some tribal groupings get offended when he fails to attend their ceremonies after being invited. He cited the Kalumba traditional ceremony of the Chewa-speaking people as one such ceremony which he had given a miss.  President Lungu revealed that some people were accusing him of siding with the Ngoni-speaking people after he attended this year’s Ncwala traditional ceremony. The president disclosed that his failure to attend the 2017 Kalumba ceremony has caused so much resentment that some people are threatening not vote for his Patriotic Front.  Lungu said the division being caused by traditional ceremonies is worrying, especially as traditional ceremonies are supposed to unite all groupings. The president told traditional leader that he would only attend ceremonies once the ministry of Chiefs and Traditional Affairs had resolved the issue.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
