	     Pretoria - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has urged his country and South Africa to stand together to protect their economies against cyber attacks. During his opening remarks at the annual Bi-National Commission between South Africa and Zimbabwe held in Pretoria, Mugabe said cyber attacks were being used as a means to undermine the economies of the two countries and that this should be guarded against. "I think together we should protect our economies from those trying to destroy them," said Mugabe. Zimbabwean Minister of Defence Sydney Sekeramayi said at the forefront of the cyber attacks were the British. "Regime change is an agenda that is being pursued very vigorously by the British," said Sekeramayi. "They have always been fighting against Zanu-PF." Sekeramayi said cyber attacks were a global problem being suffered by countries including China, the US and Russia. "So you get a situation where every country is taking the necessary precautionary measures so that they are able to identify where cyber attacks are originating from and what measures can be taken to neutralise them." "So as Zimbabwe we are also in the process of now building that machinery that is able to identify and neutralise those attacks." He added that while the biggest threat to the Zimbabwean economy, recently, has been sanctions and companies and investors leaving because of the countries land reform programme, the economy was now under threat because of cyber attacks.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
