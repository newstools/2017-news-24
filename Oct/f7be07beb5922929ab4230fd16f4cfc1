	       Nairobi - Kenya's election commission chief says he is confident that the country has conducted a "free, fair and credible election." Speaking ahead of the announcement of results, commission head Wafula Chebukati said on Monday that a "fresh team" of election staff had worked on the October 26 presidential election, which was a rerun of a vote in August that was nullified by the Supreme Court. Chebukati had said before last week's vote that he could not guarantee its credibility. The commission chief expressed his sorrow at the loss of life and property that has occurred during the troubled election process. President Uhuru Kenyatta ran without a significant challenger last week after opposition leader Raila Odinga boycotted the vote.      24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
