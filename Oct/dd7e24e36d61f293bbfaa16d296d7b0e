	     Cape Town – FF Plus Western Cape leader Corné Mulder has expressed concern at the ‘sudden wave’ of farm attacks in the Western Cape. In a statement on Tuesday, Mulder said three recent farm attacks in the province have set off alarm bells. Allthough farm attacks have not been dominating headlines in the Western Cape as much as they have been in other provinces, Mulder said that the Cape had been holding its breath in anticipation of farm attacks spreading.  Roadside stall His statement was made in response to three farm attacks over the past few weeks in the Western Cape, which resulted in two deaths. Joubert Conradie, a 47-year-old Klapmuts farmer and 46-year-old Mark Fagan from Klein Dassenberg near Philadelphia, were shot dead just over a week apart. A third farmer, from Ceres, was allegedly attacked and stabbed with a knife several times in his roadside stall. He survived the attack. “The FF Plus wants to caution local farmers to approach safety on their farms in a new way; to increase security measures and to always be vigilant as farm attacks can occur anywhere in the country,” read the statement.  The party has called on police to find offenders and gather intelligence on any further attacks, adding that Agri Western Cape should ensure farmers’ safety. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
