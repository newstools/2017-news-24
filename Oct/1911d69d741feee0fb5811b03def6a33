	     Mthatha – An awaiting-trial prisoner was shot dead by a police officer while trying to escape from the Eastern Cape High Court in Mthatha on Monday afternoon. Another officer on the scene was stabbed multiple times. Police spokesperson, Lieutenant-Colonel Mzukisi Fatyela, said the 32-year-old prisoner had been part of a group of seven men who were appearing in court on charges relating to a murder in 2010.

"While the detainees were being escorted, one of the prisoners attacked a police officer and started to stab him several times on his upper body," said Fatyela. Fatyela said the prisoner then advanced on a second police officer, while wielding the same knife. "This member fired warning shots in vain and eventually a shot was fired at the attacker, which killed him," he said. Fatyela said the first officer had been rushed to hospital with stab wounds and was said to be in a stable condition. IPID was informed and attended the scene.
