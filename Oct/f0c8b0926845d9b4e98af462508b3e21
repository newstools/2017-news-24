	     Durban – The South African National Civic Organisation (SANCO) on Tuesday called on authorities to continue to increase efforts to "unmask and uproot corrupt elements" within the South African Police Service. "Treacherous police officers, whose loyalty is to their greed and not our communities, represent a serious security threat that must be neutralised as a matter of top priority," Sanco spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu said.

Mahlangu called for the immediate suspension of the police officer and a deeper probe into whether or not he was linked to other crimes. 'Rid the service of bloodsuckers' "It is these scoundrels that are compromising the safety of our communities and the lives of their own colleagues," he said. He said the war against crime "must first be won within the police service" before it could be won in communities.
