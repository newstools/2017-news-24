	     Johannesburg – Vicki Momberg, the real estate agent whose racist rant at a black police officer was caught on camera was found guilty of four counts of crimen injuria by the Randburg Magistrate's Court on Friday.  Momberg's racist tirade happened after she became the victim of a smash-and-grab robbery in Northriding, Johannesburg, in February 2016. Magistrate Pravina Rugoonandan said on Friday that the words used by Momberg was racial and intentional. She also said Momberg knew her actions were unlawful.  Rugoonandan explained the four charges of crimen injuria against Momberg. ALSO READ: Vicki Momberg previously charged for racist rant 11 years ago One was for calling the 10111 hotline and calling the person who answered the phone a "f*****g k****r", and another for calling another call centre agent a "f*****g bitch". The other was for calling the 10111 call centre agent a "useless k****r" and the last was for calling Constable David Mkhondo, who assisted her on the scene of her accident a "useless k****r" and "black bastard". In the video clip that went public, Momberg can be heard complaining about the "calibre of blacks" in Johannesburg. "The calibre of blacks in this town [varies] from the calibre of blacks in Durban. They're opinionated, they're arrogant, and they're just plain and simple useless. I am happy for a white person to assist me, or a coloured person, or an Indian person. I do not want a black person to assist me," she shouted. 'I will drive them over' "Let me tell you something. This is the type of police force we have got. We've got a low calibre of people working. If I see a black person, I will drive them over. If I have a gun, I will shoot everyone," she tells the officer before driving off. Earlier this year during her trial, she said that she would not have been able to identify the alleged smash-and-grab suspect. "All I would have been able to say was that he was black," she testified.

Mkhondo said the VW Polo also stopped and a woman got out and immediately started making racist slurs. News24 previously reported that Momberg didn't deny Mkhondo's testimony, but instead said she was "intimidated" because she had been robbed by a black man. "I hope he (Mkhondo) will one day understand what I felt like."
