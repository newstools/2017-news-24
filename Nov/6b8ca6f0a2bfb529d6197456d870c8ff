Eager to reduce the levels of serious crime by targeting crime generators such as drugs, members of the Despatch and KwaNobuhle police stations acted swiftly last Tuesday (October 24th) when they received valuable information about a vehicle allegedly transporting drugs. “Police members noticed the vehicle at about 12:10 travelling in Butise Nontshinga Street, Khayamnandi, Despatch and pulled the vehicle off the road. The vehicle was searched and members discovered 139 bundles of khat wrapped in plastic bags,” said Captain Gerda Swart, Uitenhage Cluster: police spokesperson. The three males (all in their 30s) were arrested on the spot and detained on a charge of illegal dealing in drugs. Uitenhage deputy Cluster Commander, Brigadier Ronald Koll lauded the members for the good work and said, “The police remain committed in their quest to rid the streets of illegal drugs. “I encourage our community to supply the police with information about anyone who may have illegal drugs and firearms in his/her possession”.
