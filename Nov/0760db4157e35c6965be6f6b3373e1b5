	     The two Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) officers from the Thokoza precinct, east of Johannesburg, seen 'eating money' in a video have been served with pre-suspension letters.WATCH Johannesburg – Two Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) traffic officers have been suspended for three months each after their video and photos went viral on social media, Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago said on Thursday. The officers, from the Thokoza precinct, east of Johannesburg, appeared before the Chief of Police on Tuesday, where they were given a chance to state why they should not be suspended, Kgasago said. The pair were told to hand in their uniforms, and their appointment cards were confiscated on Wednesday. Kgasago said in a statement that an internal investigation was underway. The two have been suspended for bringing the department into disrepute and displaying unprofessional conduct. The photos show the two uniformed officers showing off stacks of R100 and R200 bank notes while eating lunch from disposable lunch containers in the boot of a VW car. The video shows the officers listening to music, eating lunch and using the notes to pick their teeth and wipe their mouths. "Meat is being eaten, money is being eaten," someone says in Zulu, while a woman taking the video notes that there is a lot of money in the boot. Road Traffic Management Corporation's Simon Zwane had described the behaviour of the traffic cops as unacceptable. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
