Omega Moagi UGU District Municipality has been building a new water pipeline from Margate to Gamalakhe since early this year, and while construction seems to be coming to a fold residents are disgruntled due to damages to affected area infrastructures. The roads have been damaged by graders during construction. This includes the newly tared Irene Road, which was handed over by Ray Nkonyeni Municipality on November 3. An electricity box on the street was also knocked down during construction resulting in a house having no power for the past two weeks. Residents demand to know if and when these damages will be repaired. “The whole process already caused enough distress while construction is ongoing with the noise, electricity and water disruptions, now that they have finally moved on from our street, we need to know when they will repair the damages,” said Zona Mahlanza, who lives in Tedder Avenue, extension three. Ugu District municipality spokesperson France Zama said the pipeline was installed to improve the water supply in Margate, Ramsgate, Seaslopes, Uvongo and surrounding areas. “The current infrastructure has been unable to meet the demand especially during peak season­ periods which has led to water interruptions. “The municipality then took a resolution to install new supply lines from the Ugu Sports and Leisure Centre reservoir to better service and meet the supply demand in these communities during peak and off-peak seasons,” said Zama. He said disturbed roads and driveways would be rehabilitated. “Regressing has already started on Wingate Avenue, Alexander Road, Jellicoe and Tedder Avenue,” said Zama. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
