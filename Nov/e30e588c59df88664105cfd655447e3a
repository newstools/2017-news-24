	     Cape Town – The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) could not confirm on Thursday afternoon whether President Jacob Zuma provided reasons for why he should not be prosecuted for corruption. A team of prosecutors has been appointed by NPA head Shaun Abrahams to consider the case against Zuma. Zuma faces prosecution for 783 counts of corruption. NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku told News24 that the "special" team has yet to meet to discuss the president's charges. "I am not privy to their (the team's) engagements with the lawyers representing the president that is why I am saying at this stage I won't be in a position to comment up until I am directed otherwise," Mfaku said. "Let's wait for them to assess the situation and then engage the national director. Then we will be in a position to take the nation into our confidence in terms of the way forward." Mfaku could not clarify when the public would be informed of potential prosecution against Zuma. "Let's look at next week, it won't be today." Zuma's spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga could not be reached for comment. Zuma has been avoiding prosecution for 18 charges amounting to 783 counts of corruption, fraud, racketeering and money laundering levelled against him in 2008. The NPA gave Zuma until Thursday, November 30, to make representations as to why they should not charge him with corruption. READ: NPA to Zuma on corruption charges: We will only accept new representation The request followed a Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) dismissal of an application by Zuma and the NPA to appeal a High Court ruling which declared that the 2009 decision to drop 18 corruption charges against him was irrational.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
