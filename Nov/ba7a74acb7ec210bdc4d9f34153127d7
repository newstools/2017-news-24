                 ICYMI: A colleague of murder-accused Jason Rohde tried to resuscitate his wife Susan at the Spier Wine Farm. He felt he could not let Rohde and everyone else down so he carried on performing CPR for 30 to 45 minutes. Thompson got excited when blood came out of her nose because he thought her heart was pumping again. The defence believes that the injuries sustained on Susan's body may have been caused by the CPR performed.  ICYMI:   Defence asking about neck and jaw injuries present on Susan Rohde. Wonder whether this might have been caused at resuscitation by Jason's colleague Mark Thompson, and Jason.  Apparently resusc injuries are common when done by lay people. ICYMI: Here is a list of injuries that were previously submitted to court by independent forensic pathologist Dr Reggie Perumal: The report allegedly showed that there were several old and new injuries on Susan Rohde’s body. Injuries in the process of healing: -	A bruise of 26cm x 16cm on her right thigh -	 A bruise of 7.5cm x 4.8cm on her left thigh. -	Also "many healing bruises on her lower limbs". New injuries: -	Left shoulder -	Left side of her brow -	Below and behind her right ear -	On a finger and knuckle of her left hand -	Left wrist - Left forearm  -	Toe on her left foot -	 Neck, jaw and chin -	A deep new bruise on her tongue -	Ribs 2 to 5 on her left side, ribs 3 to 6 on her right side, and part of her breast bone also broken. State pathologist now asked to look at private pathologist Dr Reggie Perumal's report.  Going to cut lights for slide show. Jason Rohde moves out of dock to allow for slides to be projected on wall behind dock. Pathologist says that Jason's version could explain some of his findings, but he needs more info because there was definitely signs of blunt force trauma on Susan #Rohde @TeamNews24 When Jason #Rohde woke up later he needed to go and do conference closing address and wanted to brush teeth etc. Door was locked and he thought Susan was trying to spite him @TeamNews24 In morning Susan Rohde woke Jason up and said: "Your whore has sent me a message." Jason told Susan he's "through with this" and wanted out of the marriage. She got up and went to the bathroom.  At one point Susan fell into a flower bed and cut her toe. They later went back to the hotel room. Jason told Susan it was over and tried to get some sleep @TeamNews24 They had a massive verbal and physical fight as Susan would not let Jason #Rohde leave the room. She pulled at him, he tried to get away, he hit her to get away @TeamNews24 Later on way back to their room, Jason was invited to afterparty and Susan #Rohde said no. @TeamNews24
