	     Cairo - Egypt has summoned the ambassadors of Canada, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Britain in protest over a statement they made expressing concern over the fate of a detained human rights lawyer. The move on Sunday came after the countries issued a rare public statement Friday regarding the case of Ibrahim Metwally Hegazy, who focused on the issue of forced disappearances and was himself arrested in secret on September 10 at Cairo Airport on his way to a UN meeting on the topic. In its statement, Egypt's Foreign Ministry called the statement "unacceptable", saying it was an outright intervention in its internal affairs and judiciary. Authorities later acknowledged Hegazy's detention, and he remains in custody on charges of "spreading false news". His son disappeared at an Islamist protest in 2013. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
