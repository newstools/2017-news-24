	     Durban – Police have made another breakthrough in the Marianhill massacre case after arresting a 27-year-old suspect on Monday morning.  The man was nabbed in KwaNdengezi and was in possession of two unlicensed firearms - a 303 rifle and a 9mm pistol, police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said. He is set to appear in the Pinetown Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. The first man to be arrested, Mbongiseni Brian Shozi, 24, is expected in the same court on Wednesday after his bail application was postponed.  Shozi has been charged with the unlawful possession of a firearm, murder and attempted murder.

He was arrested a few days later. Shocking details of blood and bullets emerged in Shozi’s previous court appearance last month. Investigating officer Constable Nhlanhla Mzimela took to the stand and told a packed gallery how a key witness – known only as Mr Gwala – who escaped murder on October 5, described his version of events in gory detail.  Mzimela said that Gwala could identify Shozi as one of the killers and said that he would be a flight risk because he had initially attempted to evade police.  The matter continues this week.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
