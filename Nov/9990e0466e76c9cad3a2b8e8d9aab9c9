Pam Magwaza Johannesburg - A giant snake was found under a man’s car bonnet in Parktown, Johannesburg on Wednesday morning.  Louw Zama posted a picture of the massive reptile being extracted from his bonnet on Facebook.  “This is what came out of my bonnet just after I parked my car in Parktown this morning,” he captioned the picture that shows what appears to be a snake handler in the process of removing the snake from a VW Jetta.  Major League DJz later posted a video of the snake extraction on their Twitter page.  They say the snake was removed from Louw’s car at the BP offices in Parktown.  “They found this snake in my cousin friend’s car this morning at BP offices in Parktown. Can’t believe this. Good Lord,” they tweeted. DRUM has reached out to Louw Zama for comment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
