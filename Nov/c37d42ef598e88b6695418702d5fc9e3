She said the point is to alleviate the stress of exams, and the need of basic necessities for pupils who come from disadvantaged homes. “I matriculated at Amakholwa so I know the challenges that pupils at that school have,” Ngcobo said. With examinations under way since Tuesday, October 24, the beauty pageant queen said she does not want to disturb matriculants, so the first beneficiaries of her collection will be pupils in Grades 8, 9 and 10. She said she hopes that by November 4 she will have collected enough pads and pens to donate to all, because thereafter she will be preparing for the World Miss University competition. “This is why I ask anyone to assist by donating a pack of pads and a pen for Amakholwa pupils. We want to give hope to them by ensuring they write exams comfortably.” To donate, phone Ngcobo on 074 295 5985. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
