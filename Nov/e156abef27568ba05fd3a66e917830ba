	     It has only been two days since former Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe resigned from office but for some citizens he’s already dead and
buried. A video has emerged of Zimbabweans ‘holding a funeral’ for
the 93-year-old former president. In the video, a group of people can be seen singing funeral
songs as they circle a box with pictures of Mugabe plastered on it. Fake
mourners begin to wail as the fake viewing of the body takes place. Some wave at the box while others fall into fits of agony as
they continue with the mock funeral. The video is taken on a busy street in Zimbabwe. Emmerson Mnangagwa was
inaugurated as President of Zimbabwe in the capital city of Harare this
afternoon. This comes after Robert Mugabe ruled for over 37 years as president. Watch the video below:   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
