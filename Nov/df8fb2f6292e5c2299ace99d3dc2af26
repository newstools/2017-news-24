	     Harare – President Robert Mugabe's nephew Patrick Zhuwawo has
reportedly said that his uncle has hardly slept since the military seized power
on Wednesday. According to Reuters, Zhuwawo, however, said that Mugabe's
health was otherwise "good".  Zhuwawo
reportedly said this from a secret location in South Africa.  He said
that Mugabe and his wife Grace had no intention of stepping down, adding that
they were "ready to die for what is correct". This came as a former Zimbabwe cabinet minister Tshinga Dube said
on Saturday said that the ruling Zanu-PF party was set to recall Mugabe "as
early as tomorrow". Dube spoke as thousands of residents of the capital pushed closer
to the official State House in a massive rally calling on Mugabe to go. Mugabe remained under military house arrest and was said to be
resisting efforts to step aside. Dube said:"we
are just going to properly send the old man away as early as tomorrow or
so". Provincial branches of the ruling
party have passed no-confidence votes in Mugabe and called for the Central
Committee to meet this weekend and recall him as party leader. They also wanted
first lady Grace recalled as head of the women's league. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
