	     A video has emerged of police officers storming into a
church in Hillbrow in Johannesburg following the attack on one officer by the
churchgoers on Sunday morning. In the video the congregants can be seen running as the
squad of police officers storm into the church.  As they go through the church – seemingly looking for
someone – they are stopped by what appears to be the ushers of the church. A
scuffle ensues as the officers attempt to walk through the premises with much
resistance by the ushers. This incident took place after churchgoers viciously
attacked a police officer outside the church for attempting to tow an
illegally-parked vehicle which was causing traffic congestion, as reported by News24. The vehicle belonged to one of the churchgoers and so the
congregants attempted to stop the car from being towed by rioting. The officer then fired a warning shot into the air in an
attempt to stop the crowd but they proceeded to attack him – leaving him
unconscious. One person has since been arrested. Watch the video here:   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
