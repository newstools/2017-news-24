	     Harare – Zimbabwe's Transport and Infrastructure Minister Joram Gumbo has reportedly admitted that the country's struggling national airliner, Air Zimbabwe, is running "noisy aircraft' and that it is "ailing". According to New Zimbabwe.com, Gumbo said this while answering a question by an opposition lawmaker - in parliament - who had asked how far the company had gone with plans of a return to "servicing lucrative international routes".   The minister said that the Air Zimbabwe was "ailing and not doing very well". He said: "...This is why I requested cabinet to allow us to go into partnership with any other airline to make sure that we remain in the skies. Having done that, we also discovered our books were not in good order and so we have started to invite our own indigenous people who might be interested in aviation to come and join us or come with whoever they may partner to ply our routes." Gumbo said that the government had started negotiation with 12 international airlines which included Ethiopian, Turkish and Malaysian airlines.  He also said that locals who were interested in assisting the national carrier were welcome to assist.  This came months after reports said that the cash strapped airline and several other airlines were barred from flying to Europe over safety concerns.         24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
