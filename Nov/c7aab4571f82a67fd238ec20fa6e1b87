Scores of people have gathered outside Parliament in Zimbabwe, where moves are afoot to impeach President Robert Mugabe. Harare - Zimbabwe's Parliament members are cheering as they listen to allegations against President Robert Mugabe as they enter the next stage of the impeachment process. Parliament is now forming a committee to investigate the allegations against Mugabe, including that he "allowed his wife to usurp constitutional power" and that he is "of advanced age." Mugabe also is accused of allowing unpopular first lady Grace Mugabe to threaten to kill the recently fired Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa and other officials. In addition, "we have seen the president sleeping in Cabinet and international meetings to the horror, shame and consternation of Zimbabweans." The impeachment motion was introduced by the ruling party and seconded by the opposition MDC. It is not clear how long the process will take.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
