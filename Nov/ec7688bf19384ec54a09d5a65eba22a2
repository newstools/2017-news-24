	     Residents in Cleland, Bellevue and Hayfields have been without water for more than two days after municipal workers allegedly burst a pipe while fixing another one.  The Witness received numerous calls from home and business owners on Monday saying that they have been without water since Saturday. The chairperson of Cleland Ratepayers Association, Vernon Vogt, said sewage and a white substance would regularly flow from the pipe. This waste would then run into Emkhondeni stream.  Vogt claimed that municipal workers originally came to clean up on Comrades Marathon day and accidentally damaged a water pipe. “There has been bubbling fresh water coming from that pipe since May,” said Vogt.  Municipal workers came to fix the pipe on Saturday but in doing so they damaged two other pipes — one that supplied water to the three suburbs and a sewer pipe. Msunduzi Municipality spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha said residents of the suburbs would have water again by late on Tuesday. In a separate incident, another pipe burst caused flooding outside shops at 411 Hoosen Haffejee Street in the central business district on Tuesday morning. According to business owners it was reported early in the morning but was still flooding the area in the afternoon. “We are worried that the water bill might go sky high for water we did not use,” said a shop owner.                                                 A burst pipe in Hoosen Haffejee Street floods outside  shops.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
