	     A video has emerged on social media of a man being ignored at a police station while he asks for help reporting a case. In the video, which was posted on News, Accidents, Robberies & Incidents, an unidentified man takes a video of a police officer ignoring him as he tries to file a trespassing case. The police station in question is said to be the Vaalwater Police Station in Limpopo.  “You gonna help me open a case for trespassing, are you going to help me?” the man is heard asking. The policeman is then seen slowly taking a seat and ignoring the citizen, while whistling. The man explains that it’s the second time he’s come in for help but one policeman told him to go to another officer for help. The cop in the frame continues to ignore the man, as he writes on some papers while whistling. The video has received over 18 000 views so far.
