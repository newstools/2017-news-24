	     Cape Town – Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille says "false" disclosures by the executive director in her office, who has made damaging claims against her, cannot be viewed as the actions of a whistleblower but are instead a criminal offence.She also believes Craig Kesson leaked information and claims against her to certain politicians which "is suggestive of a political campaign".De Lillie issued a 22-page response on Wednesday in response to a 42-page affidavit by Kesson which became public last Tuesday. READ: 'Bullying' De Lille wanted alleged tender irregularity report to 'go away' - executive director "It is unfortunately not correct that Mr Kesson acts in good faith and without animosity towards the people he vilifies in his affidavit," she said."His affidavit itself does not request any outcome. It is either a politically motivated attempt to embarrass me, or an attempt to contrive protection as a supposed whistleblower."Kesson, in his affidavit, said he was making the sworn statement under the protections afforded by the Protected Disclosures Act and the city's whistleblowing policy.However, De Lille brushed this side.'Criminal offence'"I am advised that the disclosure of false information purportedly under the legislation which he involves is a criminal offence," she said."That falls under the jurisdiction of other authorities. I have been notified that other individuals aggrieved by Mr Kesson's false affidavit have independently reported the matter to the statutorily designated authority."De Lille's response to Kesson's affidavit has shed even more light on major divisions fracturing the City of Cape Town's top tier of staffers.Kesson's affidavit made various allegations against De Lille, including that she planned to publicly discredit a senior city staffer who questioned alleged tender irregularities and asked that a report into a possible R43m loss regarding another tender be made to "go away".Last Tuesday, the council held a special confidential meeting and unanimously resolved that the City's audit and performance audit committee be instructed to appoint an independent investigator to probe allegations against Kesson, city manager Achmat Ebrahim and Melissa Whitehead, the commissioner of the transport and urban development authority.     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
