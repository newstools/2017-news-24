	     Harare - Zimbabwe's former finance minister and a leader of the ruling Zanu-PF party's youth league have been denied bail in cases that have raised concerns about the military's actions during its recent takeover. Ignatius Chombo and Kudzanai Chipanga have been linked to a party faction loyal to Robert Mugabe's wife, Grace, whose presidential ambitions triggered the military intervention. Both told a court over the weekend that they had been detained for days before being turned over to police. Chombo is accused of corruption and Chipanga is accused of denigrating the military.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
