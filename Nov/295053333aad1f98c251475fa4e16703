	     Harare – Zimbabwe's former war veterans minister Tshinga Dube, who was dropped from President Robert Mugabe's cabinet in August has lashed out at Zimbabweans for remaining "passive as their rights continue to be trampled upon". According to New Zimbabwe.com, Dube was given a standing ovation by Members of Parliament at a pre-budget seminar in Victoria Falls last week after he took a swipe at "docile" Zimbabweans. Dube expressed his shock at how Zimbabweans continued to sleep in queues at banking halls and not take action over the country's worsening situation. Cash problems continued to grip the southern African country, with bond notes introduced in November 2017 failing to address the situation. "…Just go around the cities and towns and see how many people stand in queues day in, day out and not getting their money. "They go home and do the same thing everyday. and they don't complain. Is that normal," Dube was quoted as saying. Dube's dismissal from Mugabe's cabinet came after he challenged the nonagenarian to name or groom his successor in-order to stop the continued factional fights in the ruling Zanu-PF party.  "There is nothing wrong with talking about the succession. Succession is not a crime to talk about. This happens in every country. All what the war veterans are saying is that he must groom the next leaders so that whatever happens to him, or when he retires there is somebody we know," Dube was quoted as saying at the time. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
