	     Durban - The ANC Youth League in KwaDukuza condemned the alleged dumping of faeces, supposedly by some of its members, at a function attended by former finance minister Pravin Gordhan on Sunday. "I don't know anything about it. We never agreed on such a thing," said Musa Zondi, secretary for the league in KwaDukuza. "We really condemn that with contempt," he said. The Mercury reported that a group of protesters threw faeces at the entrance to the Siva Sungum hall in Stanger earlier on Sunday while Gordhan was there. Mfanafuthi Ngcobo, ANCYL regional chairperson for greater KwaDukuza, told News24 he was called out urgently to assist with a disruption, and when he got there, he found a group of angry people protesting over the construction of a mall in the area. He could not confirm the faeces incident and also said the ANCYL was not involved. He said the situation was volatile when he arrived. He understood from speaking to the protesters that Gordhan was addressing a fundraiser in support of some residents who are unhappy with developers of a mall on a once vacant stand in the community. Some residents felt that they are being left out of the mall project and want to be part of any opportunities that may arise, such as employment, or having shops. He said the situation eventually calmed down. Comment from Gordhan, or the organisers was not immediately available. Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas were fired in a controversial reshuffle by President Jacob Zuma earlier this year. The ANCYL have said on numerous occasions that it is not happy with Gordhan's criticism of the government.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
