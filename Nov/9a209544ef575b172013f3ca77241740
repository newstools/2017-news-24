The killing came after four taxis were torched in Esigodini earlier on Sunday.  These incidents led to taxi drivers under the Edendale, Esigodini Taxi Association taking to the streets in protest on Monday morning to voice concerns about their lives being in danger. The protesting taxi drivers used burning  tyres  to  block  Moses Mabhida­ Road and downed tools with taxis ferrying­ people to and from the area suspended and commuters being stranded and finding travel to and from the area difficult Plessislaer SAPS spokesperson, Captain Musa Ntombela said on Monday­ the police were called to the scene of the protest. By noon, however, they had managed­ to ensure the road was functioning­ normally. Attempts to obtain comment from the uMgungundlovu Regional Santaco and the Edendale Esigodini Taxi Association­ chairperson were un- successful­ at the time of going to print.  On October 6, the Esigodini and Emgodini communities marched to and handed over a memorandum of demands to the Plessislaer SAPS, which outlined their concerns and fears regarding the ongoing taxi route dispute in the area.  One of the demands was that the community wanted a new association in these areas to be granted permission to operate on the route.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
