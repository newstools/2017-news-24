	     Bulawayo – A Zimbabwean man, 38, has appeared in court for allegedly killing his neighbour over a botched donkey deal, says a report.  According to NewsDay, Hlupeko Mabuzane was not asked to plead when he appeared at the Zvishavane Magistrates Court facing allegations of killing his neighbour Malambeni Makondo. Mabuzane was again expected in court on November 14. The court heard that sometime last week, the accused bought a donkey from Makondo and the two agreed that the deceased would deliver the donkey to the accused.  The deceased, however, failed to deliver the animal within the agreed time-frame, resulting in a dispute.  The accused then allegedly picked up a log and attacked the deceased several times on the head and arm. Makondo was rushed to Zvishavane District Hospital where he later succumbed to the injuries. This came months after a 34-year old man killed his drinking friend - axing him five times - for leaving him behind at a bar. Antony Ndlovu was arrested after brutally attacking Tapiwanashe Mutakaya, 43, with an axe, causing his instant death. Witnesses were quoted as saying that Ndlovu had confronted the deceased after he was left behind, leading to a fist fight between the two neighbours. Their brawl was stopped by security guards, but Ndlovu allegedly followed the deceased to his home, where he allegedly threw profanities at the deceased in front of his wife. Mqondisi Maseko, who was Mutakaya's neighbour, said the two again had a go at each other, resulting on Ndlovu axing the deceased.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
