	     Cape Town - The corruption, racketeering and money laundering trial of former top cop Arno Lamoer and four others was postponed to December in the Western Cape High Court on Thursday. The trial paused in October when Lamoer indicated that he would need Legal Aid because he could no longer afford the services of advocate Grant Smith. Lamoer was appointed Western Cape police commissioner in 2010 and retired in 2015. He, businessman Salim Dawjee and three brigadiers Darius van der Ross, Sharon Govender and husband Colin Govender, face 109 charges of corruption, racketeering and money laundering involving R1.6 million.  They have pleaded not guilty. The court has heard that among the things tow truck company owner Dawjee allegedly paid for was fuel and clothing accounts, apparently in return for favours from the accused. During an extended trial-within-a-trial, the accused's lawyers questioned the legality of the State's surveillance during the case. It also emerged that the investigating officer's work diary was stolen in Durban, so he had to reconstruct it. The case will be back in court on December 4. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
