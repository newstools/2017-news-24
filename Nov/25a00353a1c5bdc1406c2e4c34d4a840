	     Pretoria – The Office of the Public Protector said on Thursday that technicians were working to fix problems with the office's website after it went down on Thursday. The office said in a statement that it had recently switched over to a new website with improved capacity to carry voluminous files that include investigation and annual reports, among other heavy documents. Spokesperson Cleopatra Mosana said it had come to the attention of Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane that the new site had been going on and offline since its launch in October. She said this had left members of the public distressed. In the statement, Mkhwebane apologised for the glitches. She requested that the public be patient while her office addressed the issue. "Members of the public are advised to use alternative avenues such as email, walk-ins, telephone, postal services and outreach clinics to lodge complaints." In early October, important documents were damaged when the roof at the office of the Public Protector collapsed during a heavy downpour in Pretoria. On Thursday, part of the ceiling of the Public Protector's office collapsed.  Should citizens wish to submit their complaints to the Public Protector, they could also contact the toll free line on 0800-11-20-40, the customer service line on 012-366-7143 or email customerservice@pprotect.org  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
