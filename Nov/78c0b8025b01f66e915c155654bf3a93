	     Cairo - A South African organisation has announced that an Egyptian rights campaigner won its Nelson Mandela award for individual activism for 2017. Civicus says in a posting on his website late on Monday that Khaled el-Balshy, a former board member of Egypt's Journalists' Union, will receive the Individual Activist award of the Nelson Mandela - Graca Machel Innovation Awards on December 7 in Fiji. It says el-Balshy "has boldly and relentlessly pursued the cause of free speech, despite facing personal judicial and online harassment." El-Balshy was handed a year-long suspended sentence in March, along with the former head of the union and another board member, over charges of "harboring fugitives." Egypt under President Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi is the third-largest jailer of journalists in the world, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
