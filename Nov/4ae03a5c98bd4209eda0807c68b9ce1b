	       Harare - Zimbabwe's opposition party MDC-T, which supported Robert Mugabe's removal from office, says it is "cautiously optimistic" that incoming leader Emmerson Mnangagwa "will not mimic and replicate the evil, corrupt, decadent and incompetent Mugabe regime." Spokesperson Obert Gutu says that "the electoral playing field should have been completely evened up" when the country goes into elections next year. Gutu says in a statement on Thursday that the opposition party will closely watch Mnangagwa's next moves, "particularly regarding the dismantling of all the oppressive pillars of repression and oppression that had been put in place by the outgoing Mugabe regime." Mnangagwa was a longtime Mugabe ally before being fired by him earlier this month. The incoming leader praised the ruling party on Wednesday and vowed death to "enemies."  He will be sworn in Friday.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
