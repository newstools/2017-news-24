	     Port Elizabeth - Determined to see the children at her school succeed, Motherwell’s Elufefeni Primary School principal, Amanda Ntsumpa, has dedicated herself to establishing a culture of reading among the pupils.  This happens through a reading committee which she spearheads at the school to ensure that every learner has dedicated time to read during school hours.  The reading club session at the school has over 100 learners and takes place on a weekly basis.  “This is my small contribution in serving the nation by serving my community through a commitment to promoting literacy. I am dedicated to lead by example and my own passion for reading keeps me going,” she said.  To honour Ntsumpa’s literacy activism, and as part of International School Library Month, Nal’ibali, the national reading for enjoyment campaign, presented the principal with a custom-made hanging library stocked with books in isiXhosa and English as means of applauding her for a job well done.  “Having access to leisure books and stories at an early age is essential for children.  “It provides them with the language foundation they need to do well in the classroom, as well as for success later in life,” Malusi Puwe, a Nal’ibali literacy mentor working in the Motherwell area said. He described that most South African children had limited access to books; living beyond the easy reach of a public library and without a wide selection of books to choose from at home.  “This makes school libraries, classroom reading corners, and the adults who supervise them critically important,” Puwe added. Nal’ibali advocates for reading for enjoyment in home languages and English, noting that children who are exposed to good-quality stories in languages they understand, are motivated to learn to read and write.  The campaign is recognising the efforts of the teachers and school librarians across the country who are going above and beyond to encourage their learners to read. The work that Ntsumpa has done to improve literacy has had a noticeable impact on the learners.  “Being encouraged to read for enjoyment at school helps us to become knowledgeable and be informed. Knowledge is power, reading is fun,” Grade 7 learner, Anezwa Mangcasana said.  “Parents are invited to attend events at the school that promote literacy, which is presented to inspire parents to reinforce reading at home,” Ntsumpa said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
