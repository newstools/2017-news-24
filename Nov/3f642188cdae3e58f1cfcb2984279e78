	     Nairobi - Kenya's newly sworn-in President Uhuru Kenyatta is criticising the Supreme Court's nullification of his August election win, saying that "despite ... being told that the processes matter more than your vote, we complied." Kenyatta has been sworn in after an extraordinary series of events that saw the August vote nullified over irregularities - a first in Africa - and the repeat vote last month boycotted by the opposition, which says electoral reforms are still needed. Kenyatta says the past few months "have been a trying time" and stretched the situation "almost to the breaking point." He adds, however, that the court acted with independence, and he says the events show that "our constitution is no piece of paper." He says that institutions should not be destroyed whenever they don't deliver the desired results. Elsewhere in Nairobi, police are trying to block opposition supporters from holding a memorial for the dozens of people killed during the long turmoil.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
