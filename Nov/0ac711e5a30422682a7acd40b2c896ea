 
 BY SISTER KATE BRISTOW, DIABETES EDUCATOR NOVEMBER is Diabetes Awareness Month and November 14 is International Diabetes Day.  Diabetes is a condition in which the body does not produce enough or properly respond to insulin. Insulin, a hormone, which is produced in the pancreas, allows cells to absorb glucose, which they turn into energy.   If you have diabetes, it is either because your body is not making enough insulin, or it is not using the insulin properly. Sugar goes round and round in your blood, and does not get into the cells to give you energy, leaving you feeling tired and unwell.   There are two more common types of diabetes - Type 1 is an autoimmune condition which most often occurs in younger people and the body makes no insulin at all, making it essential that the individual takes insulin to control the levels of sugar in their blood.  Type 2 occurs in 90% of those who have diabetes. It is a condition associated with our lifestyle today – we do not exercise enough and eat the wrong foods.   So more pressure is put on the body and the pancreas cannot keep up with the amount of insulin it needs to produce or our bodies do not use the insulin we do make correctly.   There is no such thing as a touch of diabetes. You either have diabetes, or you don’t.   Some patients with diabetes are able to control their blood sugars just by changing their diet and their lifestyle. Some people need to take tablets as well, and still others will require insulin to help them keep their blood sugars under control.  Symptoms to look out for in Type 2 diabetes - chronic tiredness, general feeling of being unwell, excessive thirst, excessive passing of urine, wounds that don’t heal easily, regular infections and illness and blurred vision.  Who may be at risk - family history of diabetes, being overweight especially round the tummy area, diabetes in pregnancy or a baby of over four kilograms, risk goes up if up you over 40.   It is important to control diabetes as high blood sugar levels or poorly managed diabetes can affect all organs in the body.  Diabetes is a chronic condition, which cannot be cured.          24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
