Van Breda is accused of axing his parents and brother to death, seriously injuring his sister and defeating the ends of justice.  "You had ample time to consider the State's case against you and to think of explanations for things you consider incriminating," prosecutor Susan Galloway told him during cross-examination.  "Where you can't come up with a reasonable explanation you say you can't remember."  Van Breda denied this.  "I say I can't recall when I can't recall."  Galloway said Van Breda's memory became vague when he could not give an alternative explanation and that his memory loss occurred in relation to incriminating evidence against him.   ICYMI:  Henri Van Breda re-enacts alleged fight with balaclava-clad intruder  Armed with a fake axe and replica knife, Henri van Breda on Thursday re-enacted the alleged fight between himself and a masked intruder, demonstrating how he sustained the minor wounds he claims to have suffered in the attack which saw three of his family members bludgeoned to death almost three years ago.  With Sergeant Clinton Malan – who took Van Breda's first statement to the police – assuming the role of the balaclava-clad attacker, Van Breda slowly took the court through his alleged movements as he came face to face with the man in a corner of his bedroom.  He demonstrated how he disarmed the axe-wielding suspect, who produced a knife and swiped at him, causing the cuts on his forearm, chest and, later, a stab wound to his side.  He also showed how he came to hit the attacker on the left shoulder before the man apparently fled.   ICYMI:  Henri van Breda says he does not recognise axe used to kill his parents, brother Triple murder accused Henri van Breda said he did not recognise the axe used to bludgeon his parents and brother to death, the Western Cape High Court heard on Tuesday.  During his first day in the witness box, the 22-year-old said he had never seen the axe around the family's De Zalze Estate house before.  This despite the family's domestic worker Precious Munyongani earlier testifying that the murder weapon looked like the axe stored on a shelf in the scullery from where she used to fetch the ironing board.  Van Breda, while giving his evidence-in-chief, said prior to seeing the axe, exhibit one, in court, he hadn't seen it before, but would not dispute that Munyongani had seen a similar one in their Stellenbosch house.  He also denied killing his parents and brother with an axe, attacking his sister Marli, and staging the scene to make it look as if he had thrown the weapon at a wall in the house.
