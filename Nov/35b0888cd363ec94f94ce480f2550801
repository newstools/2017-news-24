Animal welfare inspector Angelique Stanbridge and Carmen Hoy, an administrator of the shelter, were on their way to bank R48 000 when hijackers approached their society vehicle. Stanbridge was hospitalised after she was shot in the arm during the hijacking metres from the animal shelter just after 16:00. The stolen vehicle was found later and is currently with police. The money – to be used to fund the shelter – was not recovered. The organisation’s head veterinarian, Dr John McMullen, says: “What is happening in Cape Town? We had the paramedics transporting sick children to hospital, who were attacked and the child died. And now we are in the same situation. Our inspectors, like the paramedics, are vulnerable when going out into community,” he says. “Our vehicle was hijacked and our inspector was shot and hospitalised. Our staff are in shock and receiving counselling. We thank the public for their support during this time.” Staff of the animal shelter say the money lost will now have to be fundraised. Police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk says police are investigating the case. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
