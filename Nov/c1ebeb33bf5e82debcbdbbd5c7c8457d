	     Rapist Mzikayise Mkavu (27) has subsequently been removed from society.   The efforts of a dedicated team of police investigators were rewarded when Mkavu was sentenced effectively to 228 years’ imprisonment.  Mkavu terrorised women in KwaNobuhle between 13 July 2008 and 2016 and raped several victims between the ages of 16 and 31-years.   He was linked to the rape charges through his DNA and arrested during April 2016.  “Violence committed against women and children is in the forefront of our fight against crime and offenders can expect that police  investigators will pursue every avenue to   ensure their conviction,” said Captain Gerda Swart, police spokesperson of the Uitenhage Cluster.   The relentless efforts by members of the Provincial Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS) together  with the criminal justice system, proved   to be effective, when Mkavu was sentenced in the Port Elizabeth High Court on 17 cases of rape, 10 for assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm, 8 charges of robbery with aggravated circumstances and 1 charge of attempted murder.   Provincial Commissioner of the Eastern Cape, Lt General Liziwe Ntshinga said: “SAPS has the responsibility to protect the vulnerable in society and these responsibilities are taken very seriously through     thorough investigations.   “Sentences such as this will send a strong message to potential rapists and we trust that the lengthy sentence will serve as a deterrent to criminals preying on our women and children who are not in a position to defend themselves”.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
