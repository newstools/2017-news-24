Cape Town - South African-born Henry Badenhorst, described as the man who revolutionised gay dating through the website Gaydar, died after plummeting 23 floors, Gaydar's managing director Rob Curtis has confirmed. The 51-year-old apparently died in a similar manner to his partner when he fell to his death from Michelangelo Towers in Sandton. "The motive behind the incident is unknown and the police are investigating," police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele said over the weekend in a News24 report.  Badenhorst is believed to have checked into the exclusive Michelangelo Towers on Friday for one night only. The UK's Mail Online reported on Monday that he died a decade after his partner, Gary Frisch, who fell from the balcony of a London building in 2007. Badenhorst's death has shocked the Gaydar team, Curtis tweeted. Eighteen years ago, Henry and his partner Gary revolutionised the way that gay men meet and in doing so created a safer environment for LGBT people everywhere. We are shocked and saddened to hear of Henry's passing and send our sincerest sympathies to Henry's friends and family. Gaydar, which Badenhorst founded with Frisch, was launched in 1999 and is a leading dating and social site and app for gay and bisexual men. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
