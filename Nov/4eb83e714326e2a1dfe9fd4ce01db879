	     Harare -Zimbabwe's state-run broadcaster says that according to protocol, the country's outgoing leader would attend Friday's swearing-in of incoming President Emmerson Mnangagwa. But while Robert Mugabe remains in the capital, Harare, it is not clear whether he will attend the ceremony at a 60 000-seat stadium. The 93-year-old Mugabe resigned on Tuesday shortly after Parliament began impeachment proceedings.  His firing of longtime ally Mnangagwa as vice president earlier this month led the military to step in and set off a public outpouring of calls for Mugabe to go after 37 years in power.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
