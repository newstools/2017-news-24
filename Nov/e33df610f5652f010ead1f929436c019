Jeanette Chabalala Durban – Two men were killed when a taxi they were driving in rolled down the embankment off the M7 east-bound in Pinetown, KwaZulu-Natal paramedics said on Saturday. When paramedics arrived on scene on Friday night, they found the taxi lying at the bottom of the embankment, said ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring. Meiring said the body of one man was found lying a few metres away from the taxi, while the second man was found lying some distance away on the road.  The men who are believed to be in their 30s sustained several injuries.  "Unfortunately, nothing could be done for them and they were declared dead on the scene. It is believed that the wet roads were a contributing factor to the cause of the collision," Meiring said.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
