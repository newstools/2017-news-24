Led by mayor Themba Njilo and acting city manager Dr Ray Ngcobo, the municipality staff, security and traffic officials went up Langalibalele (Longmarket) Street, into Timber before going into Church Street. They went from table to table to check if the vendors are permitted to operate on these streets, to buildings with illegal extensions and electricity and water connections and to those conducting business in incorrect zones. In a passage in Timber Street they discovered a structure had been built over a water meter where a salon operated. In another part of the same passage cables illegally connected to an electrical power supply were discovered. Occupants and workers at illegally extended buildings, mostly in Timber Street, told the mayor and his team they were occupying these places as tenants, but they were told to remove their belongings because come Monday the demolition of these structures would get under way. Items believed to be counterfeit were also taken from some street vendors. Njilo at the launch of the initiative said the municipality would use the waste management hierarchy derived from goal one of the national waste management strategy, which ensures that minimal waste is disposed of by avoiding, reducing, recycling, treating and disposing of waste.        The establishment of the EPWP [expanded public works programme] steering committee will ensure the implementation and constant monitoring of all waste management administration and that waste management operations run smoothly and simultaneously,” Njilo said. He said refuse removal will be improved and sufficient trucks and drivers will be allocated with staff rotating all around the city at night and during the day. Part of the clean-up will involve the temporary closure of the Imbali Taxi Rank for the cleaning of drainage systems, pesticide spraying and remarking of lanes on Pietermaritz Street where the rank is. Uptown Ward 27 councillor Manqoba Ngubo said taxi leadership had been consulted on the closure of Pietermaritz Street from Retief to Boshoff streets.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
