	     Cairo - The death toll from an attack on a mosque in Egypt's Sinai rose to 305 including 27 children, the state prosecution said Saturday in a statement detailing the gruesome massacre. It said there were between 25 and 30 attackers with long hair and beards, dressed in camouflage and flying a black banner with the Muslim profession of faith on it, which could be a description of the Islamic State group's flag. They surrounded the mosque and opened fire on the worshippers on Friday, it said. The attackers had arrived in five all-terrain vehicles and later set fire to seven cars belonging to the worshippers. The statement said witnesses recounted hearing gunshots and explosions before some of the assailants entered the mosque. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
