	     Johannesburg - Sentencing proceedings for former Deputy
Minister of Higher Education and Training Mduduzi Manana are expected to resume
in the Randburg Magistrate's Court on Wednesday.  He was due to be sentenced on Tuesday but the matter was
postponed. Manana was convicted of three counts of assault with intent
to do grievous bodily harm after pleading guilty to the charges in September.  The charges relate to the assault of three women at Cubana
in Fourways on August 6. A video of the assault surfaced on social media and sparked
widespread condemnation.  Outside the magistrate's court on Tuesday, Manana said he
"wants justice to be delivered, especially to the victims".  He said he wanted to reach out to the victims, but his bail
conditions did not allow it. "I would initiate a process after the case to reach out
to the victims, to reach out to the families," he said. In his plea explanation in September, Manana said one of the
women, Noluthando Mahlaba, who joined their table, had asked him: "Who do
you think you are? You isitabane [gay]." He said that following this remark, he intentionally
assaulted Mahlaba with an open hand on her face and back. Manana also said he pulled her hair, pulled her to the
ground, kicked and punched her. He said a fight then broke out in which he also
intentionally assaulted two other women - Monoisa Duma and Thina Mopipa. The case against his co-accused, Thulani Mdaka and Cyril
Madonsela, has been postponed in the same court to November 16 pending a victim
impact report. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
