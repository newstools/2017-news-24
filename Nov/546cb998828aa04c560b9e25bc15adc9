The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has denounced a false claim that there is a Christmas competition which beneficiaries should enter in order to win a prize.  The agency strongly warns beneficiaries to not fall prey to the fraudulent claim circulated via an SMS that beneficiaries should enter a competition to win a prize. Pearl Bengu, acting chief executive of Sassa, says the fraudulent SMS by people claiming to be Sassa officials is a scam. He strongly discourages beneficiaries from entering the fake competition, adding that they should not provide their personal details as requested in the fake SMS.  As a condition for entering the fake competition, these fraudsters ask beneficiaries to send their ID numbers, PINs and Sassa card numbers.  The fake SMS reads as follows: “Dear SASSA client. You are selected in our Christmas draw. 10 out of 100 clients can win R1 500 that will be in your account the 1st December 2017. Please urgently reply/SMS, to enter in the draw, your ID no, last 4 digits of card no & your PIN. Lucky Christmas draw – Sassa Head Office.” “This is a scam,” says Bengu. “Beneficiaries are urged to ignore and delete these SMSs.  Sassa officials will never ask for pins or Sassa card numbers.  Furthermore, the agency does not run any Christmas competitions. Beneficiaries are reminded to keep their PINs secret and not to disclose their card and ID numbers at all. Beneficiaries of social grants need to be extra vigilant during this time of the year, as there are many fraudsters who will target the innocent and vulnerable, says Bengu. Beneficiaries are advised to call Sassa on 080-060-1011 whenever they are offered something that seems too good to be true.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
