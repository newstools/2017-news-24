	     Harare - Zimbabwe's incoming leader is urging people to "remain patient and peaceful and desist from any form of vengeful retribution" on the eve of his swearing-in. Emmerson Mnangagwa in a new statement calls himself the "president designate." He will be inaugurated on Friday morning, ending a whirlwind of events that began early this month with his firing by Robert Mugabe. While the opposition backed the peaceful removal of Mugabe, there are concerns about what might change under his longtime deputy and the ruling party. It is not clear whether Mugabe will attend the ceremony at a 60 000-seat stadium in the capital, Harare. Mnangagwa's statement says that "we are currently working on transitional arrangements."   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
