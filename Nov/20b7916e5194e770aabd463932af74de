	     A video has surfaced on social media of a taxi driver
refusing to let an emergency vehicle pass in the yellow lane – and it has people
up in arms. The 35-second clip, recorded at an unknown location in
Gauteng, shows an ambulance driving behind a taxi with its siren on, hooting
and signalling to the taxi to get out of the way. However, the taxi simply stays put, picking up the pace.  The ambulance was allegedly on its way to the scene of an accident. According the Pigspotter
Twitter account, the video was recorded from inside the ambulance by a
passenger. Inconsiderate taxi blocking the emergency lane whilst an ambulance is trying to get past to get to the crash scene. Video taken from inside the ambulance, by the passenger.  pic.twitter.com/nOhE7R2xqt  Angry viewers ranted against the taxi driver in the comments
sections, with others adding they were all too familiar with this kind of
behaviour.   “This is what we have to deal with on a daily basis from these
taxi drivers,” one person commented. Another weighed in, “That taxi driver should go straight to
jail. He is putting lives at risk.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
