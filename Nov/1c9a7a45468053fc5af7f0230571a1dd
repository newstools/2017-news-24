	     Johannesburg – A 30-year-old man, who is believed to be a victim of a hit-and-run accident, was found dead in Roodepoort, west of Johannesburg on Sunday.  ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said paramedics found the man lying in the middle of the Kilburn and Paul Kruger Road intersection.  "The man was assessed and found that he showed no signs of life. Paramedics immediately initiated CPR and advanced life support interventions, in an effort to revive the man. Unfortunately, after some time, no vital signs returned and the man was declared dead." The vehicle that had apparently hit the man was not found at the scene, Meiring said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
