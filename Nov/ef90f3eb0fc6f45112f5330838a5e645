	     Harare – The Zimbabwean
army on Friday reportedly said that it was "engaging" with President Robert
Mugabe, adding that progress had been made in targeting "criminals" around
the veteran leader. According to BBC, the military
said in a televised statement that it would advise the nation on the outcome of
talks with Mugabe "as soon as possible".  Mugabe
held talks on Thursday with regional envoys and the army chief, with reports
indicating on Friday he had so far refused to step down.  However,
a NewsDay report said that Mugabe had "agreed in
principle" to relinquish power, adding that he was set to
exile in South Africa.  "He [Mugabe] has agreed in principle to step down. Details of
his exit package are being worked out…. He will exile in South Africa," NewsDay quoted military and security sources as
saying. The report said that details of
Mugabe's exit conditions were still "closely-guarded". Political tensions within Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party exploded after
Mugabe fired his vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa last week. It followed
numerous attack of Mnangagwa by the first lady Grace Mugabe who was said to be
eyeing the presidency ahead of the Zanu-PF congress in December.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
