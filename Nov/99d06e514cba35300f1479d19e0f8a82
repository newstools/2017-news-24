	     Polokwane - A 19-year-old man has been arrested in connection
with the rape of his elderly aunt in Makgophong village in Limpopo over the
weekend. "It is alleged a 64-year-old woman was attacked and
raped by her nephew after she heard a knock at the door – and after opening,
she was surprised to find him…wearing only his underwear," said Lieutenant
Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe on Sunday. "He grabbed and throttled her until she fell
unconscious and he subsequently raped her." The incident happened at around 03:30 on Saturday morning. The teen will appear in court on Monday. "The South African Police Service in this province
condemns in the strongest possible terms violent attacks perpetrated against elderly
people," said Ngoepe. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
