	     Johannesburg – The City of Johannesburg is offering a R100 000 reward for information that would lead to the arrest of suspects who stole cables worth R2 million.    The cables were stolen in a break-in at the City of Johannesburg’s data centre in Braamfontein, Mayor Herman Mashaba said in a statement on Saturday.  The suspects allegedly gained access through an emergency exit door on the ground floor of the building in the early hours of the morning, he said.   “After gaining access, the criminals broke down a door leading to a storeroom where contractors, who were doing maintenance work, keep their tools. “They then took grinding machines and extension cords, which they used to cut the cables.” He said the stolen cables were connected to two power generators which were recently purchased and were in a process of being tested. Mashaba said there were no damages or power outages experienced.   He said they were in the process of building their data centre and disaster recovery centre. “We suspect that this was an inside job, judging from the way that the criminals gained access to the building.  There are no signs of forced entry from the door they used.”  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
