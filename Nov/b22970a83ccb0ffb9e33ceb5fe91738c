                 Dr Butler says focal epilepsy has a warning. Lack of warning - as reported by #VanBreda - indicates generalised epilepsy rather than one that starts in one part of the brain. #VanBreda was oblivious to his myoclonus, the only one he chose from list of symptoms. Coincides with what was found on EEG, Dr Butler says. #VanBreda has myoclonus, the name given for his jerks and twitching. Dr Butler says he concluded that there was compelling evidence that #VanBreda had a “generalised tonic-clonic (epileptic) seizure” on the night of the murders. Adjourn for lunch. #VanBreda #VanBreda said after period of amnesia on night of murders, he was disorientated and in shock. Doesn't remember some questions put to him. Recalls paramedics walking past him, but not the ambulance arriving. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy doesn't impair daily function, Desai asks. Correct, Dr Butler says. #VanBreda Major jerks while asleep is a myoclonic jerk, Dr Butler says. #VanBreda #VanBreda has epilepsy - "unambiguous", Dr Butler says. He is legally not allowed to drive for a year. Minor seizures are associated with major seizures. Minor occur more frequently. #VanBreda hadn't pushed the button. Butler spotted it in the EEG. #VanBreda's left hand on lap. Right hand behind his head. Thumb moves away from palm, Dr Butler says. Often both sides. Movement occurs at time of seizure discharge in brain.

Consistent with someone recovering from seizure. Appearance is similar to patients in postictal state. #VanBreda denied biting his tongue, experiencing aching muscles or having wet himself, but later remembered that police had found urine on the pants he had been wearing. Dr Butler checked with #VanBreda if someone may have hit him on the head. He didn't hear anyone following him, and nobody came towards him down the stairs. Court is now looking at EEG on the screen  #vanbreda pic.twitter.com/GxMnMNLGd4 #VanBreda told Dr Butler he describe the jerk, which he explained was his whole body giving "just one shake". Could happen 5 times a day (max) and often doesn't experience it for 3 days. Sometimes doesn't notice any jerks for a week. While examining the EEG reports and seeing the abnormalities, Dr Butler was confident that Henri #VanBreda had epilepsy. Dr Butler says he didn't discuss diagnosis with #VanBreda or his girlfriend, other than to say he would check for epilepsy or stress-related seizures. Usually discusses likely diagnosis, but due to unusual circumstances and possibility of malingering he didn't. Because of #VanBreda's twitches/jerks, Dr Butler thought he may have had epilepsy, psychogenic non-epileptic seizures or malingering. Henri has just walked in after the tea break - court had resumed without him. Dr Butler will repeat what he had just said. Only symptom #VanBreda confirmed were jerks, Dr Butler says. He also reported experiencing panic attacks while in court. The are two symptoms: 1. Brief absences - which Van Breda has denied the presence of. 2. A funny twitch or jerk. #VanBreda apparently had a few episodes where memory became unclear. Happened while at college but thought it was caused by excessive alcohol consumption. #VanBreda had had at least six glasses of wine that night. People they had told thought it was caused by the alcohol. #VanBreda had a similar event in Feb 2016. He was again talking about the case. Felt emotional and without warning lost his memory. It happened after dark. His gf could see he was shaking, later he appeared "out of it" and very tired. Henri cant remember how he felt. #VanBreda didnt bite tongue or wet his pants, Dr Butler says.His gf phoned her dad who advised what medication to take. #VanBreda's girlfriend said his face was red and jaw was clenched. Didnt turn his head to either side. Didnt salivate and breathing was noisy. When regained consciousness he felt light headed, disorientated. Typical symptoms after a seizure. #VanBreda told Butler that at 16:30 on 8 Nov, he was sitting on his bed with his gf discussing the court case. Without warning he abruptly lost his memory. She says he fell backward and his eyes rolled back. His arms and legs were shaking, she reported.
