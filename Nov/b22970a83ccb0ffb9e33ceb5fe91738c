                 #VanBreda's left hand on lap. Right hand behind his head. Thumb moves away from palm, Dr Butler says. Often both sides. Movement occurs at time of seizure discharge in brain. On screen Henri #vanbreda during his hospital visit pic.twitter.com/d2dKBKuz02 In photo of #VanBreda in ambulance, he has dark rings under eyes, bruise at left eye, looks considerably "dull" to him, Dr Butler says. Consistent with someone recovering from seizure. Appearance is similar to patients in postictal state. While examining the EEG reports and seeing the abnormalities, Dr Butler was confident that Henri #VanBreda had epilepsy. Dr Butler says he didn't discuss diagnosis with #VanBreda or his girlfriend, other than to say he would check for epilepsy or stress-related seizures. Usually discusses likely diagnosis, but due to unusual circumstances and possibility of malingering he didn't. Because of #VanBreda's twitches/jerks, Dr Butler thought he may have had epilepsy, psychogenic non-epileptic seizures or malingering. Henri has just walked in after the tea break - court had resumed without him. Dr Butler will repeat what he had just said. Only symptom #VanBreda confirmed were jerks, Dr Butler says. He also reported experiencing panic attacks while in court. The are two symptoms: 1. Brief absences - which Van Breda has denied the presence of. 2. A funny twitch or jerk. #VanBreda apparently had a few episodes where memory became unclear. Happened while at college but thought it was caused by excessive alcohol consumption. #VanBreda had had at least six glasses of wine that night. People they had told thought it was caused by the alcohol. #VanBreda had a similar event in Feb 2016. He was again talking about the case. Felt emotional and without warning lost his memory. It happened after dark. His gf could see he was shaking, later he appeared "out of it" and very tired. Henri cant remember how he felt. #VanBreda didnt bite tongue or wet his pants, Dr Butler says.His gf phoned her dad who advised what medication to take. #VanBreda's girlfriend said his face was red and jaw was clenched. Didnt turn his head to either side. Didnt salivate and breathing was noisy. When regained consciousness he felt light headed, disorientated. Typical symptoms after a seizure. #VanBreda told Butler that at 16:30 on 8 Nov, he was sitting on his bed with his gf discussing the court case. Without warning he abruptly lost his memory. She says he fell backward and his eyes rolled back. His arms and legs were shaking, she reported.
