	     Pretoria – Police have opened multiple culpable homicide dockets after eight people were killed in an accident on the N1 near Modimolle on Friday. Limpopo police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said three cars and a truck collided on the N1 south near Modimolle. He said five people in a double cab died instantly, while three other passengers in one of the other cars also died. "The crime scene investigation is still on and an update will be released soon," Ngoepe said. "The cause of this accident is still unknown but police investigations will tell," he said. This follows another fatal accident on the N1 north near Polokwane on Thursday night in which 11 people were killed when a taxi collided with a truck after it hit a donkey. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
