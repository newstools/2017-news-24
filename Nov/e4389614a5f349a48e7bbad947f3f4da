LAST Sunday, the Kokstad Stock Theft Unit embarked on a crime drive in Franklin and Swartberg and recovered 14 stolen cattle and two horses. Police suspect the livestock was stolen from Umzimkhulu and was about to be taken to Lesotho. “Two suspects fled the scene when they saw police. The stock is being kept in Kokstad waiting for the owners to identify and claim them,” said SAPS spokesperson Dumisani Ncongo. SAPS told stock owners to brand their stock. KZN SAPS spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said police will act against stock owners who fail to do so “Our stock theft units in the province are willing to assist the community to brand their stock. Donkeys and horses are also being stolen,” said Zwane. He said the community must report stray cattle to the police. Criminals must be reported and people must not buy or accept suspected stolen livestock from anyone. He said police will intensify their operations throughout the festive season to curb stock theft. “Operations like roadblocks, stop-and-search and high patrol visibility will be conducted in the province,” said Zwane. - Supplied.
