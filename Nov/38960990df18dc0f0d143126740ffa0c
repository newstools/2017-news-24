	     Bamako - A bus travelling in northern Mali was blown by a mine on Monday, killing at least four people, police and administrative officials told AFP. "A bus hit a mine near Ansongo," a small town about 100km from Gao," the regional hub, a Malian military officer in the area said by phone. "At least four civilians, including a teenage girl, were killed. There were injured as well." A local official, reached by AFP, added: "It was jihadists who laid the bomb in order to terrorise local people, whom they accuse of providing information to the security forces." The passengers were heading to a weekly fair in a location several dozen kilometres from Ansongo, the Gao region transport association told AFP. "There's no safety," said Oumar Guire, a member of the association. "There are attacks by armed robbers, or jihadists who put down mines in the road." Islamist extremists linked to al-Qaeda took control of the desert north of Mali in early 2012 at the expense of Tuareg rebels, but were chased out of Sahara towns by an ongoing French-led military operation launched in January 2013. In mid-2015, a peace accord was signed with Tuareg leaders aimed at isolating the jihadists. But much of the region remains lawless, despite efforts by Mali's army, French soldiers and a UN force, Minusma. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
