 President Jacob Zuma has denied that he received
any undisclosed money from private individuals or companies during his term as
president.  This was Zuma's answer to an urgent question put on the order paper
by DA leader Mmusi Miamane for Thursday's question session in the National
Assembly, relating to allegations that he had received monthly payments of R1m
from Roy Moodley, without declaring it to the South African Revenue Service.  Next question:  ANC MP Mohlopi Mapulane wants to know if the government is currently able to effectively manage the 
consequences of climate change, especially its impact on the economy. IFP's Mkhuleko Hlengwa is again asking how much litigation matters is costing taxpayers.  "I don't keep records of the state about litigation involving the government," says Zuma. "The president has been defending himself," said the president #ZumaQandA @TeamNews24 #Zuma: If political parties can't debate in Parliament they go to court and then the state must defend.#ZumaQandA #ZumaQandA: ANC MPs shout, "You are racists!" to the DA bench.

He and DA then leaves NA chamber, amid cheers by ANC #ZumaQandQ @TeamNews24 #ZumaQandA: Things getting tense in the House. DA's and deputy speaker Lechesa Tsenoli over Zuma not answering a question. @TeamNews24 A visibly angry DA leader @MmusiMaimane: "The president is going to jail!" #ZumaQandA @TeamNews24 "You are useless! Absolutely useless!" DA chief whip @jsteenhuisen to deputy speaker Lechesa Tsenoli #ZumaQandA @TeamNews24 "We demand answers", says Maimane.  "Be calm, you don't have to beat up tables here," says deputy speaker Lechesa Tsenoli. #Zuma: The answer gives impression that I've been running to court. I've been defending. I've spent money, government has spent money. When asked about his legal costs in defending the spy tape saga, Zuma talks about himself in the 3rd person #ZumaQandA @TeamNews24 The Leader of the Opposition #Maimane on what is the total amount in Rand of all legal costs incurred by his Office and/or the Presidency? #Zuma: The Min. of Finance handles the purse, it's a question of timing. When do we start, government is discussing this all the time. #Zuma: I am is not obsessed with the energy deal, there is a need for it. We are facing many challenges including climate change.#ZumaQandA #ZumaQandA: National Speaker Baleka Mbete has blocked a number of valid supplementary questions from opp MPs today. @TeamNews24 #Zuma: BRICS bank will have a friendly approach towards countries that are struggling. #ZumaQandA #Zuma says he won't "answer books".

The truth will be found. #ZumaQandA #ZumaQandA - Zuma concedes it's not his call to dictate to Parliament whether it wants to have "parallel" state capture inquiry. @TeamNews24
