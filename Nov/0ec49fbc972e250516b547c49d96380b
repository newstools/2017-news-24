	     Brussels - The European Union on Wednesday called for a "peaceful resolution" to the crisis in Zimbabwe, following military intervention which saw President Robert Mugabe, 93, placed under house arrest. Mugabe's decades-long grip on power in Zimbabwe 
appeared to be weakening as military vehicles blocked roads around 
parliament, though generals have denied they are staging a coup. "It is a matter of concern for the EU," European Commission spokesperson Catherine Ray said. "We
 call on all the relevant players to move from confrontation to dialogue
 with the aim to a peaceful resolution," she told a daily briefing. READ: Zimbabwe war vets group wants Mugabe recalled "We
 are following very closely what is happening on the ground, underlining
 that the fundamental rights for the citizens need to be respected and 
the constitutional order and democratic governance to be upheld." Mugabe
 and his wife Grace are on the European Union's sanctions blacklist 
targeting key figures in Zimbabwe's ruling elite with travel bans and 
asset freezes. The EU first imposed sanctions against Zimbabwe in 2002 over its rights record. Mugabe
 has called sanctions by the EU and United States "wrong" and last year 
blamed them for his government's failure to pay its workers on time, 
which led to a crippling strike. South Africa's 
President Jacob Zuma, one of Mugabe's closest allies, said the veteran 
leader had told him by telephone that he was "confined to his home". Tensions
 between Mugabe and the military establishment, which has long helped 
prop up his authoritarian rule, erupted in public over recent weeks.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
