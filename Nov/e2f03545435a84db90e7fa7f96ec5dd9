THERE are some people who obviously have nothing better to do than create panic with “fake” news story.  Last week this irresponsible group issued a warning that the green bar-coded local ID book would reach the end of its lifespan on March 31, 2018. The Department of Home Affairs was quick off the mark stating: “We wish to make it clear that the green bar-coded ID book remains a legal form of identification and will continue to do so.” The fake news was sent out as a tweet purporting to be an official departmental announcement. Department spokesperson, David Hlabane said that a plan had been developed to systematically phase out the green ID book.  He called on all South Africans to continue to apply for the Smart ID card at any of the 180 offices equipped to roll out the “Live Capture” system. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
