	     Durban – A KwaZulu-Natal man will spend 18 years in prison for brutally beating and stabbing his grandmother to death after she cooked a meal for him.  Khayelihle Ntombela, 33, was found guilty in the Ngwelezane Regional Court this week of killing 82-year-old Bonakele Ntombela in the Othini area, in Ntambanana, in August, said Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane.  The grandmother was at her home when her grandson asked for food.  "When the deceased prepared him food, he attacked her with a knife," explained Zwane.  He said she was stabbed in the head and on the body and beat her up with a knobkierrie. "She was fatally wounded and died at the scene." Zwane said police had immediately arrested the grandson.  Acting Provincial Commissioner Major General Bheki Langa commended the detectives on their determination. "This case was finalised within three months after the crime was committed. The accused showed no mercy and brutally attacked an elderly woman who took care of him. He deserves no place in our society. His rightful place is in jail and gender-based violence cannot be tolerated," he said.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
