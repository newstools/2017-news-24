	     Johannesburg - He might be lying low, but he's not
completely living a cloistered lifestyle. Following his dismissal at the SABC, the outspoken Hlaudi
Motsoeneng set about getting involved in community activities where he
occasionally gives talks. "I get invited by many organisations including
churches," he told DRUM. "I'm also involved in the ANC itself and I engage the
youth on different platforms." Hlaudi believes it was a serious setback for the country
when the management at SABC decided to reverse his decision on the 90% local
content quota. "You can't compromise on local content," he said. "The right to local content is enforced by the
constitution of South Africa not by what people want. It's the only solution to
deal with language issues in this country. "It's critical for me to empower our people, artists,
production houses and what have you." Hlaudi says he's been talking to his lawyers on the chance
that they will challenge the SABC in court on account of local content. "I've been engaging my lawyers to take the SABC to
court on the content issue. "They had no call in reversing the local content
quotas." Hlaudi also told DRUM that he's not bitter over his axing at
the SABC. "I can't be upset," he said. "I should soldier on and fight whether I'm in inside or
outside." SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago had little to say when
asked about Hlaudi's intention to sue. "We can't comment on something that is an intention at
this stage." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
