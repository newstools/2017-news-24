	     Johannesburg – President Jacob Zuma has declared a special provincial funeral in the Free State for liberation struggle veteran and former SA Ambassador to Russia, Dr Mochubela ‘Wesi’ Seekoe, who passed away on Monday.  Zuma said Seekoe will be remembered for the significant contribution he made during the liberation struggle and in the development of a democratic South Africa.  "He has served the country with distinction as a South African Ambassador to Russia and a chairperson of the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation board". He passed on his condolences to the Seekoe family, relatives and the ANC.  "May his soul rest in peace," said Zuma.  Seekoe was a former head of the TRC recommendation structure and the first deputy secretary general of the ANC's Veterans League.  He was one of the first struggle activists that joined Umkhonto Wesizwe in exile in 1961 and formed part of the Luthuli Detachment.  Zuma has ordered the national flag to be flown at half-mast at every flag station in the Free State on Saturday, the day of the funeral.  Details of the funeral would be communicated by the Free State provincial government, he said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
