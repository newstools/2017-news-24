                 Masipa failed to give compelling reasons to deviate from longer sentence for Oscar, SCA hears Judge Thokozile Masipa failed to put forward substantial and compelling 
reasons why she deviated from a minimum sentence of 15 years when she 
sentenced Oscar Pistorius for Reeva Steenkamp's murder, the Supreme 
Court of Appeal heard  #OscarPistorius: Johnson says there was a lack of admission for doing wrong. @TeamNews24 Johnson says there is a lack of admission

 
 Justice Bosielo: I don't think those arguments are valid

 #OscarPistorius: Johnson asks whether OP is sorry to the Steenkamp's that his actions resulted in the loss of their daughter. @TeamNews24 How exactly is #OscarPistorius a sacrificial lamb and victim who suffered so much when Reeva Steenkamp is the one who died by his hand? #OscarPistorius: Johnson: "Yes the respondent apologised... I am sorry, sorry for what?" @TeamNews24 Johnson returns to the remorse argument

 

 "We still remain in a quandary"

 

 #OscarPistorius Roux concludes & now the State replies @SaturdayStar @ReporterStar @IOL #OscarPistorius: Roux concludes his submissions.@TeamNews24 #OscarPistorius Roux: Judge Masipa exercised her discretion judicially. #OscarPistorius: Roux says Masipa took into account that Oscar had been through a lot emotionally. @TeamNews24 Roux: Oscar is a broken man

 

 He's tormented for the rest of his life

 #OscarPistorius: Roux says Masipa took a holistic view in making her decision. @TeamNews24 Key line from S v Malgas:

 

 If any court referred to in subsection (1) or (2) is
satisfied that substantial and 
compelling  circumstances  exist 
which  justify  the

imposition of a lesser sentence than the sentence prescribed
in those subsections, it  shall  enter 
those  circumstances  on 
the  record  of  the
proceedings and may thereupon impose such lesser sentence.

 #OscarPistorius: Roux: "She exercised her discretion judicially."@TeamNews24 #OscarPistorius Roux: You can't write everything down...but you live the case and feel the emotion and make the judgment. #OscarPistorius: Roux submits that the leave to appeal should be refused. @TeamNews24 #OscarPistorius Roux says Masipa balanced all the facts - and found compelling circumstances to deviate from 15 years. Johnson needed 1 hour. Barry Roux now hitting his 1 hour mark. About to make final submission. Praises Judge Masipa. #OscarPistorius #OscarPistorius: Roux says Masipa did a careful balancing act when she exercised her discretion. @TeamNews24 #OscarPistorius: Roux: "Judge Masipa went through a very difficult time.. She was steadfast...she balanced the facts..." @TeamNews24 #OscarPistorius Roux says his client is traumatized and has been made a "sacrificial lamb" #OscarPistorius: Roux again says Masipa considered several factors in arriving to her six years jail sentence. @TeamNews24 #OscarPistorius: Roux says it's unfair to say that. The court should consider OP "was suffering  sever post traumatic stress."@TeamNews24 #OscarPistorius: Justice Sereti says Oscar should have gone back to the high court and told the court why he killed Reeva.@TeamNews24 #OscarPistorius: Justice Seriti: "In other words, he did not testify because he was afraid to be cross-examined?"@TeamNews24 #OscarPistorius: Justice Lamont then says the question of remorse then falls away if he was prepared to kill an intruder.@TeamNews24 Barry is seeing flames here.. Am sweating on his behalf?? #OscarPistorius "Someone he did not want to kill.

 

 "Was he prepared to kill the intruder?"

 #OscarPistorius: Roux says in coming to an appropriate sentence, Masipa considered a number of factors, including perception.@TeamNews24 Tanya Koen, speaking on behalf of Reeva's emotional mother June said:
 "The family supports the State and the law must run its course – and 
what is happening this morning is part of that legal process. "What the family is focusing on is to continue Reeva's legacy, which is the Reeva Rebecca Steenkamp Foundation." #OscarPistorius: Roux: "It is important to consider what weighed in the mind of the court. Aggregation...and the person." @TeamNews24 #OscarPistorius: Advocate Barry Roux continues to make his submissions. @TeamNews24 pic.twitter.com/V066TRWJDK #OscarPistorius: Roux says Masipa was heavily criticised for her sentence. @TeamNews24 Justice Seriti: I'm not criticising Judge Masipa.

 

 I'm trying to bring some sanity

 

 #OscarPistorius: Roux defends Masipa's decision to sentence Oscar Pistorius to six years for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp.@TeamNews24 #OscarPistorius: Roux says Masipa considered the four shots, the cubicle, the shooter and the circumstances.@TeamNews24 We are here because Judge Masipa veered from the law TWICE; like before, the SCA must correct this & give us justice #OscarPistorius #15yrs #OscarPistorius: Roux says it would not make sense to impose a 15 years jail sentence in this context, or OP's circumstances.@TeamNews24
