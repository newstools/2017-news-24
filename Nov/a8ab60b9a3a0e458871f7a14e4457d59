                 Masipa failed to give compelling reasons to deviate from longer sentence for Oscar, SCA hears Judge Thokozile Masipa failed to put forward substantial and compelling 
reasons why she deviated from a minimum sentence of 15 years when she 
sentenced Oscar Pistorius for Reeva Steenkamp's murder, the Supreme 
Court of Appeal heard  Johnson says there is a lack of admission

 
 Justice Bosielo: I don't think those arguments are valid

 Johnson returns to the remorse argument

 

 "We still remain in a quandary"

 

 Roux: Oscar is a broken man

 

 He's tormented for the rest of his life

 Key line from S v Malgas:

 

 If any court referred to in subsection (1) or (2) is
satisfied that substantial and 
compelling  circumstances  exist 
which  justify  the

imposition of a lesser sentence than the sentence prescribed
in those subsections, it  shall  enter 
those  circumstances  on 
the  record  of  the
proceedings and may thereupon impose such lesser sentence.

 "Someone he did not want to kill.

 

 "Was he prepared to kill the intruder?"

 Tanya Koen, speaking on behalf of Reeva's emotional mother June said:
 "The family supports the State and the law must run its course – and 
what is happening this morning is part of that legal process. "What the family is focusing on is to continue Reeva's legacy, which is the Reeva Rebecca Steenkamp Foundation." Justice Seriti: I'm not criticising Judge Masipa.

 

 I'm trying to bring some sanity
