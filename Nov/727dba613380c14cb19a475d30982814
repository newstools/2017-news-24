	     Pretoria - Two men were shot dead, while a third was rushed to hospital, after armed men opened fire at a taxi rank near South Street in Centurion on Friday evening. ER24 spokesperson, Werner Vermaak said paramedics had arrived at approximately 17:40, where they found two men with several gunshot wounds. "Both showed no signs of life. There was nothing that paramedics could do for them and they were declared dead on the scene." Police spokesperson, Captain David Miller, confirmed the incident.  "A white Toyota Etios with five occupants entered the taxi rank and four men jumped out and started firing indiscriminately," said Miller. Miller said the men then jumped back into the car and fled. Bystanders explained that they heard several gunshots and only saw the two men fell to the ground. Miller said the motive of the attack was not yet known. He said the case had been handed over to the taxi violence task team for further investigation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
