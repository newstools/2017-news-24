	     Harare – Zimbabwe's former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa has
been fired from the ruling Zanu-PF party, reports said on Thursday. According to NewsDay, Zanu-PF party spokesperson Simon Khaya
Moyo said that the decision was endorsed during a politburo meeting
held on Wednesday. This came two days after Mnangagwa was fired by President Robert
Mugabe, 93, from government for various allegations that included undermining
the nonagenarian. A report by the state-owned Herald newspaper said that Mnangagwa's
expulsion from the revolutionary party followed "recommendations that were made
by all the party's 10 provincial co-ordinating committees". Frustration
has been growing in the once-prosperous southern African nation as the economy
has deteriorated under Mugabe, who has been in power since independence from
white minority rule in 1980, reports indicated. Mnangagwa was the more prominent of
the country's two vice presidents and had been part of Mugabe's cabinet since
independence. He was said to have enjoyed the support of military generals and
war veterans. His critics viewed him as ruthless because he was in charge of
state security when Mugabe unleashed a North Korean-trained brigade to crush
dissent in western Zimbabwe in the 1980s. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
