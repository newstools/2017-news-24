	     Welkom – Five suspects appeared in the Welkom Magistrate's Court on Thursday for stealing pots and pans from a small town mortuary, Free State police said. Police spokesperson Mamello Mokhuoane said the suspects were arrested on Wednesday after three pots, a gas bottle, a potjiekos pot, a gazebo, an industrial gas burner, and another gas burner were stolen from a Thabong mortuary. A tip-off led to the arrest of a 37-year-old man who was found with the stolen property, Mokhuoane said. Three men - aged 44, 47 and 47 - and a 52-year-old woman were arrested later on Wednesday afternoon in connection with the burglary. The five suspects are due back in the Welkom Magistrate's court soon. They remain in custody. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
