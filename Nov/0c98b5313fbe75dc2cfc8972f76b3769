Manenberg police spokesperson Captain Ian Bennett says the operation was initiated by Western Cape Department of Community Safety and included all crime fighters, neighbourhood watches and street committees from the area. The crime prevention operation was conducted under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Wynand Muller. The street patrols were led by provincial minister for safety and security Dan Plato and Kadar Jacobs, Manenberg Community Policing Forum (CPF) chairperson. Neighbourhood watch and street committee members, including participants in the Women for Change project, Ihata women’s centre and Gems youth, and the CPF walked through the streets of Tambo Village and hotspots in Manenberg. “Residents had good camaraderie. They walked freely down roads and in areas where most would not dare to venture. This operation shows that the community has committed themselves to ensure a safer festive season,” says Bennett. He says the police, along with their law enforement partners, are ready for any event. “Muller expresses his sincere gratitude to all community crime fighters who took part in this show of cooperational operation, showing a successful partnership between police, the community and our force multipliers in the City of Cape Town.” V
