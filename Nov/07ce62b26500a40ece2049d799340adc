	     SOUTH African Social Security Agency (Sassa) is advising grant recipients to be careful of the confidential information they give to people who claim they work for the agency. This comes after PMB grant recipients received a call from a woman claiming to work for Sassa who asked for their Pin number.  Last week Sassa offices were filled with grant recipients who wanted to change their Pin number because of this. It is alleged that once the grant recipient gives out their Pin number money is withdrawn from their bank account. Last Thursday assistant Sassa Communications Manager in Pietermaritzburg, Mdumiseni Hadebe told Maritzburg Fever they are aware of the scam and three beneficiaries have come forward after falling victim to the scam.  “No Sassa employee is allowed to ask beneficiaries for their Pin number. Beneficiaries are reminded to keep their pins a secret and not disclose their card details and ID number ever. Sassa will never ask beneficiaries for their pins. “If they get calls from anyone asking for their confidential information they must not disclose anything. We advise beneficiaries to be vigilant especially over this festive season as criminals target the vulnerable, especially social grant recipients.”  Hadebe said since this scam came to their attention they have alerted all their offices and will launch an investigation. He said grant recipients who continue getting the calls must report it immediately to a local Sassa office or contact 033 846 3400 or 0800 60 10 11.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
