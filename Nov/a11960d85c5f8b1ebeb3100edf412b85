	     Johannesburg - The ANC is to celebrate its 106th birthday in East London in the Eastern Cape, ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa confirmed on Wednesday.  Kodwa said the national working committee decided that its annual January 8th celebration be held in the Eastern Cape. The January 8 celebration will be held shortly after the ANC elects its new president. "Whether there is a conference is immaterial. The next president's address will be in ( the Eastern Cape). Whoever becomes the leader must find work rolling," Kodwa said. Deputy secretary general Jesse Duarte on Tuesday established task teams as part of preparations for the event.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
