Van Breda: "I still hear the voices and giggling in my nightmares..."   Galloway and Judge Desai quiz Van Breda on how he could determine the attacker's race if he could only see the eyes through the balaclava the attacker was wearing.   Galloway: "No one would be able to identify the attacker, based on your description, do you agree with that?"  Van Breda: "I agree, it wasn't a lot to go on."   Galloway to Van Breda: "So it's not like you're a sickly, smaller built person..."   Galloway questions why the attacker ignored Henri van Breda and attacked the rest of his family.   Galloway pointing out inconsistencies in Van Breda's statement, and court testimony.   Galloway asks if the attacker laughed while attacking his brother and father. "Yes," Van Breda replies.   Galloway questions why the attacker left Henri behind in the room and went for the female voice to carry on the attack.   Henri van Breda demonstrates certain aspects of the axe attack in court.
