	       Nairobi - The United States is congratulating Kenya on President Uhuru Kenyatta's inauguration but says it's "deeply concerned" about ongoing political tensions. US State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert says the US is urging Kenya's security forces against using "unnecessary force" against citizens who are exercising democratic rights. Nauert says Kenya should hold an immediate "national conversation" to address divisions among communities. She says all Kenyans should "come together" to work toward peace and uphold Kenya's constitution. The State Department says the US is committed to working with Kenya on democracy, prosperity and security.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
