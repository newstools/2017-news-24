	      Stockholm - A Swedish prosecutor says authorities are getting little help from Democratic Republic of Congo in their investigations into the slayings of two UN experts - of which one of them a Swede - by militiamen from DRC's violence-torn Kasai region. Prosecutor Sara Nilsson says their material "does not rule out that people close to the regime in DRC are involved in the murder." Sweden launched its murder investigation two days after the bodies of dual Swedish-Chilean national Zaida Catalan and American Michael Sharp were found in a shallow grave on March 27. Nilsson said Wednesday Sweden had asked DRC for "legal assistance" but what it received "doesn't comply with basic legal requirements and has obvious flaws." She said Swedish authorities would continue their probe, but cannot visit DRC "under the present circumstances." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
