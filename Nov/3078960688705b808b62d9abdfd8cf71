A boy and a young man from Lavender Hill were shot on the corner of Prince George Drive and Joe Marks Boulevard, Steenberg on Monday last week. Steenberg police spokesperson Warrant Officer John Bartlett says it is alleged that the victims were standing on the corner, as they usually do, when they were approached by a group of unknown men. “The unknown men started shooting at them and then fled the scene.  “A 14-year-old sustained gunshot wounds to his buttocks and stomach and a 22-year-old man sustained a single gunshot wound to his left hip.  “Both were transported to hospital for medical treatment.  “In the same incident a passing vehicle was damaged by a bullet on the driver’s side door. The driver escaped unharmed,” he says. Bartlett says the motive for the shooting is gang-related as the victims are allegedly affiliated to a gang and the shooters to a rival gang.  No arrests have been made. Steenberg police have opened a case of attempted murder.
