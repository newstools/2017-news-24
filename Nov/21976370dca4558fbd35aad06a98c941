	     HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — Zimbabweans are worried about their country's fate after the increasingly isolated President Robert Mugabe did not resign in a televised speech as many had expected. "Arrogant Mugabe disregards Zanu-PF," a newspaper headline says, a reference to the ruling party that has demanded he resign by noon Monday or face impeachment. Opposition activists plan more protests to pressure Mugabe. Some ruling party members say an impeachment process likely wouldn't lead to Mugabe's immediate resignation and could take days to complete. Mugabe has been stripped of his party leadership but said in Sunday night's speech he would preside over a party congress next month. Some people in the capital, Harare, are now more cautious about talking to reporters. That contrasts with the jubilation and open condemnation of Mugabe over the weekend. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
