The vehicle left Conway Road on the N3 into the city, just past the Pavilion shopping mall, Rescue Care spokesperson Garrith Jamieson said.  "On arrival paramedics found multiple patients still entrapped in the wreckage as it lay on its roof." More ambulances were dispatched to the scene to assist and once the patients were freed, it was confirmed that five people had died, Jamieson said.  Four others had sustained serious injuries. Advanced life support paramedics stabilised the injured group before transporting them to various hospitals in the city for further care.
