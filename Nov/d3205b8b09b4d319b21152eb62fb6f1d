	     Mogadishu - The US military says it has carried out a drone strike against al-Shabaab in Somalia that killed several extremists. The US Africa Command says this is the 28th such airstrike this year in Somalia against both the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab and the new but growing presence of Islamic State group fighters. Wednesday's US military statement says the airstrike was carried out Tuesday evening about 96km northwest of the capital, Mogadishu, and occurred in coordination with Somalia's government. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
