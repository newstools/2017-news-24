	     Johannesburg – Two leaks, about 50 metres apart, have been discovered on the main water pipeline that runs through Linbro Park in the Sandton landfill site - just days after a major burst. However, the municipality has assured that the pipe was not on the verge of collapsing. "I would like to state clearly that, contrary to reports, the pipe is not caving in. These are separate leaks and are attributed to erosion caused by the landfill," MMC for environmental and infrastructure services Nico de Jager said in a statement.   Last week, the municipality said it was conducting the largest burst pipe repair operation in its history, which affected Sandton, Bryanston, Woodmead, Morningside, Alexandra, Linbro Park and surrounding areas.

He said the aim was to conduct repairs within 24 hours, or for as long as there was water in the reservoirs, to avoid residents being affected. Johannesburg Water was working with Pikitup to excavate and remove the landfill. "We initially aimed to conduct this work in mid-December, when water demand is less. But, if we wait until then, we will lose too much water. I ask for residents' patience as we steadily conduct these repairs. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
