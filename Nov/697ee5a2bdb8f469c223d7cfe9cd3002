	     Bunia - At least 15 people were killed when a lorry tumbled into a river in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, official sources said on Wednesday. Four people were also hurt after the vehicle came off the road at Isiro as it returned from a local market, Haut-Uele province governor Jean-Pierre Lola Kisanga told AFP. Kisanga said the incident near the border with Central African Republic and South Sudan was being investigated. Another source said 16 people were injured while the 7sur7.cd news website said more than 60 people were aboard in total. A local official blamed excess speed as the cause of the crash. Road accidents are a regular occurrence in the DRC given its poor infrastructure.  Sunday saw 33 people killed in the south east of the country after a freight train loaded with fuel crashed and caught fire. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
