	     Harare - Zimbabwe's military said on Friday it had detained some "criminals" in President Robert Mugabe's government after generals took power in a dispute over who would succeed the 93-year-old leader. "Significant progress has been made in our operation," the defence forces said in a statement after vowing to target "criminals" close to Mugabe. "We have accounted for some of the criminals while others are still at large." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
