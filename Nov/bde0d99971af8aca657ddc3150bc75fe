WE are fast approaching the festive season, a time when relaxation, gifts and family are on the minds of many. “However, December is a difficult time for the South African National Blood Service [SANBS] , as we are unable to collect the 3 000 units of blood a day that is needed to treat patients, like those who are terminally ill, let alone any trauma incidents. “If previous year’s blood stock levels, over the same period, is anything to go by, we know we have some tough times ahead,” said Sifiso Khoza, SANBS regional marketing manager. As SANBS: • We are an organisation that saves and promotes life. • We value life. • We value our blood donors. The greatest needs for blood are for patients who are terminally ill and rely on daily, if not weekly, transfusions for their survival as well as women who have complications during childbirth. Accidents, scheduled operations and paediatric cases are the other cases where blood is needed desperately too. We encourage the public to find 30 minutes this holiday period to donate blood because while you are relaxing and enjoying the break, your blood will probably be saving up to three lives. The KZN region has planned various special blood drive promotions over the festive season and into January 2018, with extended hours and additional weekend blood drives. The idea is to remain on people’s minds and be accessible, convenient and visible. We absolutely can’t do without this special type of volunteers.
