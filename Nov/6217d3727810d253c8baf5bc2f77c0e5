Four people were arrested for robbery with a firearm in 6th Avenue, Retreat last week.  Steenberg police officers arrested the men before the victim could lay a charge.  This robbery happened on Tuesday 31 October at about 04:15 when the 24-year-old driver of a Blue Bird taxi picked up a client in front of a house in 6th Avenue.  Steenberg police spokesperson Warrant Officer John Bartlett says while he and a passenger were in the Toyota Avanza waiting for the client, about three unidentified men came to his car and demanded that the passenger get out to be searched.  “The robbers took the car’s key and searched the car while they pointed a firearm at them. They took the driver’s tablet, navigator and other belongings and fled on foot,” he says.  Later the same day Steenberg police officers on patrol found the suspects, searched them and found the stolen property on them.  “While the driver was busy opening a case at the police station, he identified the suspects as the officers brought them in.  “Four men between the ages of 22 and 26 were arrested. “A case of robbery with a firearm was registered and the arrested men will appear in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court once they have been charged.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
