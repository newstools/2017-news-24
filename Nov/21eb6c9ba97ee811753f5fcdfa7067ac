Reporter THE Department of Home Affairs said it has taken note of a message purported to be from the department announcing that the lifespan of the green barcoded ID book comes to an end on March 31, next year. “No such announcement has been made by the department. We wish to make it clear that the green barcoded ID book remains a legal form of identification and will continue to be until such time that the Live Capture System is rolled out to all Home Affairs offices to enable South Africans to apply for Smart ID cards at their nearest offices,” the department said in a statement. “The department has developed a plan to systematically phase out the green ID book and ultimately consolidate the restoration, common citizenship, identity and dignity to South Africans. “To this end, we call on South Africans to apply for Smart ID cards at any of the 180 offices that are equipped with the Live Capture System. In addition, the department has established a partnership with FNB, Standard Bank, Nedbank and Absa to create an online portal where clients can lodge their application without visiting a Home Affairs office.” To apply, visit the Home Affairs website at www.dha.gov.za and click on the eHomeAffairs icon. – REPORTER  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
