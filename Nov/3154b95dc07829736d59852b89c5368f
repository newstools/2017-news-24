	     Berlin - A German court has ruled that Kuwait's national airline didn't have to transport an Israeli citizen because the carrier would face legal repercussions at home if it did. The Frankfurt state court noted in its verdict on Thursday that Kuwait Airways is not allowed to close contracts with Israelis under Kuwaiti law because of the Middle Eastern country's boycott of Israel. The court said it didn't evaluate whether "this law make sense," but that the airline risked repercussions that were "not reasonable" for violating it, such as fines or prison time for employees. An Israeli citizen sued the airline after he booked a flight from Frankfurt to Bangkok with a stop-over in Kuwait City. Kuwait Airways cancelled his booking when he revealed he had an Israeli passport and offered to book him on another airline. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
