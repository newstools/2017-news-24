	     Johannesburg – Two well-known South African actresses could find themselves in hot water after they were allegedly seen in a video, doing the rounds on social media, in which one of them is pretending to eat a wad of R50 notes on a plate in a restaurant. The video has become the subject of a police investigation after it was linked to a second video clip, showing bundles of notes, in various denominations, in a suitcase.  In the centre of the frame is a Fidelity Security bag – a well-known company that provides cash-in-transit services. The man taking the videos turned the camera towards himself, selfie-style on both occasions. Now the police are trying to get to the bottom of the video. The police minister's spokesperson, Vuyo Mhaga, said on Monday evening: "We are aware of the footage, an investigation is under way.” Further details were not immediately available. In the one video, one of the women, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, grinds salt and pepper over the stack of R50 notes, while a waiter asks if he can open a bottle of champagne.

In the second video, that was posted about a year ago, the same man can be heard saying: "Let's have fun… We’ve got money. Let us enjoy."     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
