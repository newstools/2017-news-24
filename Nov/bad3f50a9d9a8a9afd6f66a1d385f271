                 President Jacob Zuma, in an interview on ANN7's Straight Talk
programme, says he is confident that the tripartite alliance will not collapse.


 Although there has been no discussion about working with the
EFF, Zuma says anything is a possibility.  He has also dismissed out of hand claims that he is corrupt,
saying that he has fought corruption.

 Zuma also rejected that the state is captured, challenging
those claiming this that they should name those involved.

 ICYMI: President Jacob Zuma has released the report of the Commission into the Feasibility of Fee-Free Higher Education and Training in South Africa. Meanwhile, as Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa is campaigning in Johannesburg tonight, he says although the ANC has made strides, the rate of unemployment and inequality is "unacceptable". News24's Amanda Khoza is at that event.
