	       Abidjan - The European Union, African Union and United Nations are setting up a special task force to help protect migrants, notably those detained in squalid conditions in conflict-torn Libya. The three organisations said in a statement on Wednesday that the aim is to "save and protect lives of migrants and refugees along the routes and in particular inside Libya." The task force also will speed up the process of returning willing migrants to their home countries and finding new homes for those fleeing violence or conflict and who need international protection. The three say the task force will coordinate closely with Libyan authorities and be part of the organisations' continued efforts to dismantle human trafficking and crime networks.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
