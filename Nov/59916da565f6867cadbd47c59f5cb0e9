So bad was the situation that Rohde didn't even stay for tea at her funeral, the court heard. "My client was treated by your wife, by his father-in-law as if he was a murderer. He was ostracised, he was victimised and he was prejudged before his day in court," advocate Pete Mihalik put to Rohde's brother-in-law, Peter Norton. Norton, who was testifying in Rohdeâ€™s trial, said he thought "there was compassion mixed with suspicion".
