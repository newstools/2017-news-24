AS the festive season approaches, police have warned people about the high crime rate and the increase in house burglaries in Kokstad.  Last Friday night, a 22-year-old Shayamoya woman had her clothes stolen when criminals broke into her house. Also last Friday night, a generator was stolen from Dorning Crushers in Kokstad.  On Saturday morning, a Shayamoya woman discovered that her house had been burgled and the window and bedroom door had been broken and clothes and other items stolen.  SAPS spokesperson Dumisani Ncongo confirmed that many cases of house break-ins have been opened and warned people to be extra alert over the festive season.  “When people go on holiday they must ask their neighbours to keep an eye on their house,” said Ncongo. He warned drivers to be watchful in town after a case of theft out of a motor vehicle was opened by a 41-year-old Shayamoya man on Saturday evening.  The man had parked his car in his yard and left for church at 6pm. When he returned at 9pm, he discovered that his wallet with bank cards and money had been stolen from the vehicle.  Ncongo said a 47-year-old man had his laptop and cellphone stolen out of his vehicle after he parked his car in Hope Street on Sunday afternoon.  “The man was in a shop when criminals allegedly used a remote device to unlock his car,” said Ncongo.  The laptop and cellphone were valued at R11 000. - Supplied.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
