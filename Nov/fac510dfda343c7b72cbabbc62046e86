	     Harare – Zimbabwe’s ruling Zanu-PF party has reportedly slammed First
Lady Grace Mugabe, saying that she lacks "grooming and true motherhood as shown
by her foul language during interface rallies". According to the state-owned Herald newspaper, the youths said
this on Sunday, as they called for Grace's expulsion from Zanu-PF and President
Robert Mugabe to step down as president.   Addressing a
press conference at the Zanu-PF Headquarters in Harare on Sunday, youth league
spokesperson Cde Yeukai Simbanegavi said: "The Zanu-PF Youth League
subscribes to the African values of the ubuntu/hunhu. We have been raised to
respect our elders and revere our liberation fighters. However, of recent times
the Youth League had been hijacked by counter-revolutionaries bent on misleading
and confusing the youth." The Zanu-PF Central
Committee on Sunday recalled Grace as head of the women's league
"forever".  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
