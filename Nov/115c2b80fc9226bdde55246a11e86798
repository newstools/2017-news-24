                 The Jason #Rohde trial resumes today. Pathologist Dr Deidre Abrahams will be cross-examined on autopsy @TeamNews24 pic.twitter.com/bf4lwmfdI8 Pathologists battle it out in Rohde murder trial The pathologist who conducted a second autopsy on Susan Rohde, at the request of her husband’s legal team, omitted or missed vital information that pointed to manual strangulation, the Western Cape High Court heard. Defence in Rohde case draws on death of Steve Biko in 'paid' autopsy argument One of the defence lawyers in property mogul Jason Rohde's murder trial drew on the death of Black Consciousness icon Steve Biko to illustrate his view on the importance of a second autopsy if a cause of death is disputed. "The history of this country – the so-called dark ages before the 1990s – is peppered with miscarriages of justice," Advocate Graham Van der Spuy said in the Western Cape High Court. He was cross-examining Paarl chief state pathologist Dr Deidre Abrahams, who oversaw the autopsy on Rohde's wife Susan. The autopsy was conducted by Abrahams' junior Dr Akmal Coetzee-Khan. Rohde trial postponed to give pathologist time to read through medical research The Western Cape High Court trial of property mogul Jason Rohde, accused of murdering his wife Susan, was postponed to give the State’s pathologist an opportunity to read through medical research. Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe postponed the trial after she was informed that Paarl chief pathologist Dr Deidre Abrahams needed time to read through screeds of academic literature, which includes more than 180 pages of documents.
