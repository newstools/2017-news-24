	     Gauteng – A man who tried to pin the murder of his girlfriend on her ex, has been arrested for her murder and now faces an additional charge of perjury.  Police spokesperson captain Kay Makhubele said the 26-year-old man said he had been out walking from Ivory Park with his girlfriend, 25, when they were offered a lift to Midrand by a man is a black BMW who claimed he was the girl’s ex-boyfriend. Makhubele said according to the man, they had both entered the vehicle, but instead of driving to Midrand, it had made a u-turn and drove to an open veld near Allandale Trading on Modderfontein Road.  Makhubele said the boyfriend claimed he had been held at gunpoint and had been forced to watch as the girl’s ex-boyfriend took her into the veld and fatally stabbed her.  He said the man claimed he was then let go, and went to the police to report the incident and led them to the body, where paramedics declared the woman dead.  “The police members' instinct, led the members to interview the suspect further, where after he implicated himself as a suspect in the murder,” said Makhubele.  He said the man had then been arrested for murder and perjury and was currently being detained at Midrand SAPS. “Members of the public are strongly advised to desist from reporting false cases to the police as perjury and defeating the ends of justice are serious offences that could land a person in serious trouble with the law,” Makhubele said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
