The water infrastructure investment summit which was planned for Thursday, 30 November, at the Sandton Convention Centre has been moved to 5 December.  It was revealed on www.足sanews.gov.za that the Department of Water and Sanitation has said that the postponement of the summit had been influenced by the schedules and availability of high-profile speakers, who have confirmed their partici足pation for the first week of December.  The summit is expected to feature investors, funders, project developers, policy 足makers, regulators and local government partners who will engage in a programme of action that aims to shift the water and sanitation sector investment landscape to a space that is open and enabling for investment and inclusive growth opportunities.
