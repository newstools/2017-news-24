	     Residents in Harare and Chinhoyi share their views on the suspected military coup currently taking place in Zimbabwe against President Robert Mugabe. Watch.  
WATCH Harare - Zimbabwe's state radio resumed some of its normal programming
shortly after noon on Wednesday. The broadcaster’s Pocket’s Hill centre in
northern Harare was taken over in the early hours of Wednesday morning as the
army announced it had intervened in the country’s political crisis. The SFM station was broadcasting it’s “Eat to
the Beat” programme shortly after noon, while the popular Power FM was broadcasting
its happy returns show. A news broadcast at the top of the hour
reported extensively on the army statement, as well as two other local news
items and announced premier league soccer fixtures scheduled for Wednesday. Since early morning, all stations had only been
broadcasting recent statements from defence forces commander Constantino Chiwenga, and from the army spokesman announcing the military intervention. In
between there was only Chimurenga music - songs from or about the country’s
independence war. The state-run Herald, which had blacked out
coverage of Chiwenga’s statement earlier this week, was due to put out a
special edition. The paper’s editor Caesar Zvayi said in a tweet. He tweeted a
picture of the headline story that read: “No military takeover: ZDF (Zimbabwe
Defence Forces).” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
