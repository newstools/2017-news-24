I would like to say a very big “Thank you” to Cape Medical Response (CMR) who responded to my emergency call for my dog who had been in a dog fight. Within two minutes, two ambulances and three paramedics arrived at my home and transported my beloved pet Sunny to the vet. Sadly, Sunny did not pull through her surgery and I am heartbroken. But I will never forget the love I got from the CMR Fish Hoek team. I am blown away by their compassion. I said to one of the paramedics: “I am sorry, I know it’s a dog,” and he said: “We save lives.” I even got a phone call from them to find out how Sunny was. Jackie, thank you, and to the two other gents whose names I didn’t get. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Four months ago CMR came to the rescue when my 79-year-old mother fell and broke her hip. These guys are angels walking among us. To anyone living in Fish Hoek: Join CMR. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
