	     THEIR school is small in comparison to others in the metro, yet their passion towards recycling is enormous. Marina Sea Salt recently introduced the Shine Your Light Reusing/Recycling awareness campaign to nine schools in the metro. The campaign was supported by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality’s War on Waste programme.  “Marina Sea Salt decided to launch a reward programme for collecting empty Lighthouse Flasks. We offered to buy back all the flasks collected from the nine schools and to show our commitment to no wasting - but rather reusing and recycling,” explained Bennie Becker, marketing director of Marina Sea Salt.  “The message that we started to broadcast was, ‘if the environment wins, everybody wins’ and we wanted to reward not only the winning school but also each learner who collects the most flasks with a bike.  “The entire winning class would receive a R50 KFC food voucher each.” After four months, Cotswold Primary – which has only 528 learners – collected the most flasks and walked away with R5 000 for the winning school plus R2 each for the 390 empty Lighthouse flasks they’ve collected, thus R5 780 in total. Executive Mayor and MMC of Public Health Athol Trollip attended the prize-giving ceremony and congratulated the school on their achievement. “The fact that you’re not the biggest school that participated and that you won this award means that you all worked as a team,” Trollip said. “You are all the most amazing group of young children because you participated in this programme and because you are passionate about our environment. You should be proud of the fact that you collected the most number of bottles and that you are part of a campaign to help us in this war against waste,” Trollip said. Cotswold Primary principal Barbara Porter said the reason they did so well in the competition was that they were blessed with very dedicated parents, guardians, teachers and learners. “Recycling has always been very close to our hearts at Cotswold Primary. We have a paper recycling project and that money will be used to help improve our children’s playground. We have been promoting the recycling of water due to the terrible drought we find ourselves in.  “Our children have also been encouraged to bring their bath water in an attempt to keep the grass growing on the school fields. The learners have brought twelve thousand litres of water so far this year. I am very proud of them,” Porter said.  The Grade 1M class walked away with the prize for the class that collected the most bottles. The learner who collected the most flasks was Matthew Hartlief (6) who was ecstatic about the bicycle he received for his achievement. The school’s prize money of R5 780 will go towards paving around the school. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
