meeting would be attended by ministers from Angola, Zambia, Tanzania and South
Africa. "It [the meeting] will be co-chaired by the minister of
international relations and co-operation of South Africa and the Angolan

to the heads of state and government on the political situation in Zimbabwe," read the statement.  President Jacob Zuma,
who is the current chair of the regional body, on Wednesday denounced any
unconstitutional takeover of government in Zimbabwe. Zuma said that SADC stood ready to
assist in the political impasse currently gripping the country. "Presidency has called for
calm and restraint and has expressed hope that developments in Zimbabwe would
