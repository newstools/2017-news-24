	     Durban – Two armed and masked men abducted a family of four in Durban and forced them to drive to a local service station to withdraw cash at an ATM. Captain Nqobile Gwala told News24 that the men, who wore balaclavas, accosted the family at their home in Dunkeld Road, Reservoir Hills at about 4:00 on Wednesday. "They allegedly took jewellery and other valuables," she said. Blue Security spokesperson Andreas Mathios added that the men forced the family into their vehicle and drove to the ATM. They later fled on foot. "They jumped out of the family's car on the M19 and ran towards Quarry Road East informal settlement. The family then drove home." No injuries were reported, Mathios said. Mathios said the robbers, who had firearms, used a ladder and an eight-metre rafter to climb up to the second storey of the house, where they forced one of the windows open. A case of house robbery has been opened at Sydenham police station, Gwala added. No arrests have been made. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
