Scores of people have gathered outside Parliament in Zimbabwe, where moves are afoot to impeach President Robert Mugabe. Harare  - Bells have rung to summon Zimbabwe's Parliament members to gather for the next stage of the impeachment process for President Robert Mugabe. Parliament is now forming a committee to investigate the allegations against Mugabe, including that he "allowed his wife to usurp constitutional power" and that he is "of advanced age" and no longer has the physical capacity to run the government. The impeachment motion was introduced by the ruling party and seconded by the opposition MDC. It is not clear how long the process will take, though lawmakers have said Mugabe could be voted out as early as on Wednesday or Thursday.
