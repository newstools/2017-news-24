Lethiwe Makhanya THE Department of Home Affairs has dismissed rumours that green bar-coded ID books will not be valid after March 31, 2018.  This follows after messages did the rounds on social media last week.  The message on Twitter and Facebook read: “Kindly note that the lifespan of green bar-coded ID books comes to an end on 31 March 2018. Kindly apply for your smart ID. Let’s share the information.” The PMB Department of Home Affairs Spokesperson Thabo Mokgola said the rumours are not true and the department has released a statement in this regard. The statement released by the departments says: “We want to make it clear that the green bar-coded ID book remains a legal form of identification and will continue to be until such time that the Live Capture System is rolled out to all Home Affairs offices to enable South Africans to apply for smart ID cards at their nearest offices.  “The department has developed a plan to systematically phase out the green ID book and ultimately consolidate the restoration, common citizenship, identity and dignity to South Africans.”  The department says they have established a partnership with FNB, Standard Bank, Nedbank and Absa to create an online portal where clients can lodge their application without visiting a Home Affairs office, but only FNB in Gauteng has created an online portal.
