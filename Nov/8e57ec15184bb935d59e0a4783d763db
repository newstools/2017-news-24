	     The City of Cape Town’s Gugulethu Library today, 25 October 2017, hosted a reading competition as part of their reader phonics reading development programme for Grade 6 learners.  This programme encourages learners to read with understanding and 10 local primary schools participated in the competition, namely the Vukukhanye, Sonwabo, Luzuko, Ntshinga, Vuyani, Intshinga, Xolani, Bonga, Lwazi and Sokhanyo Primary Schools. ‘Reading enables children to apply logic in various ways and to use good judgement in everyday situations. It allows for quiet time and a state of peace and calm.  It is important that we encourage our children to read from a young age. Once the seed of reading has been planted, it is essential to keep nurturing it so that their love of reading grows stronger,’ said the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Area Central, Councillor Siyabulela Mamkeli. The competition included a book-based quiz where the learners were given books to read and were then questioned on what they had read. ‘I am proud to announce Vuyani Primary School the overall winners of the reading competition. Listening to and reading stories assists in the development of literacy and language skills.  These are incredibly important in terms of making progress in the future and I would be doing these children a disservice if I did not encourage them to continue reading,’ said Councillor Mamkeli. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
