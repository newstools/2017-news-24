	     Luxor - Egyptian officials say police have arrested 10 Nubians for taking part in a protest over the recent death in detention of a prominent Nubian activist in the southern city of Aswan. The officials say those arrested are accused of protesting illegally and disrupting public order. The officials spoke on Thursday on condition of anonymity because they aren't authorised to talk to reporters. Gamal Sorour, who died in detention on Sunday, was among 25 Nubians arrested in Aswan in September for staging a peaceful protest. They were demanding the return of Nubians to their ancestral lands from which they were evicted in the 1960s to make way for a lake created behind the High Dam on the Nile. They face charges of participating in an unauthorised demonstration and disrupting public order. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
