See pictures of Zimbabwean First Lady Grace Mugabe as she addressed thousands of indigenous church followers during what was termed a “Super Sunday Rally” at a stadium in Harare.  Harare – Zimbabwe's
ruling Zanu-PF party youth league has endorsed First lady Grace Mugabe as the
right candidate to occupy the vice presidency ahead of the extraordinary
congress set for December, a report said on Monday. According to the
state-owned Herald newspaper, the youth league's secretary general Kudzanai
Chipanga said that Grace was the right candidate because her loyalty to
President Robert Mugabe was unquestionable. This came just a day
after the first lady reportedly declared that under fire Vice
President Emmerson Mnangagwa should be gone from both the government and
Zanu-PF before the congress.  "Trouble causers in the party must go before the next
congress. He (Mnangagwa) must be dropped before we meet at congress in order for
us to have unity in the party," Grace was quoted as saying. Chipanga said that the youth league was behind Grace’s call for
the removal of Mnangagwa. "For the avoidance of doubt, the Zanu-PF youth league is fully behind
the Secretary for Women’s Affairs Amai Dr Grace Mugabe in calling for the
urgent removal of Mnangagwa from the position of the vice president noth in the
party and government," said Chipanga in comments carried by the Herald . Mnangagwa, who had been touted as a possible successor to Mugabe,
93, has recently fallen out with the first family. On
Saturday Mugabe threatened to fire
Mnangagwa, accusing him of fanning factionalism to garner
support ahead of the special congress. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
