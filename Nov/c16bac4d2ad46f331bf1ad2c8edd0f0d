	     Cape Town - A mentally disabled boy with a fascination for trains, who was last seen boarding a train en route to Cape Town, has gone missing. Gcobani Mahlokozi, 8, from Lwandle in Strand – about 45km from the city centre – has not been seen since Tuesday. Dressed in a green jersey and blue shorts, the 1.3-metre tall boy was spotted boarding a train in Strand at 16:00 that day, Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut confirmed. He was also seen at Blackheath and Bellville railway stations. According to police sources, it was not the first time that Mahlokozi had wandered away from home. He previously made his way to the railway station in an attempt to take a train trip on his own. However, he was always spotted and taken back home. The boy has a speech impediment. Anyone with information on Mahlokozi’s whereabouts can contact Warrant Officer Leon Van Wyk on 074 803 0629 or 082 334 8362, or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
