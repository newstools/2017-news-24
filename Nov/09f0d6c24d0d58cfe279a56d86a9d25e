	     Johannesburg - SAFA boss Danny Jordaan has broken his
silence after being accused of rape by former ANC MP and singer Jennifer
Ferguson.  In a statement released on Wednesday, Jordaan denied raping
Ferguson in a Port Elizabeth hotel 24 years ago.  Jordaan's attorney, Mamodupi Mohlala-Mulaudzi, released the
following statement:  "Ms Ferguson has alleged that Dr Jordaan raped her 24
years ago. Dr Jordaan denies that he raped Ms Ferguson. "In light of the scourge of gender-based violence in
this country and Dr Jordaan’s sensitivity toward the issue he had to consider
carefully his response, if any, in public to the allegations made by Ms
Ferguson. Dr Jordaan’s perceived silence in the face of such serious
allegations is because of his empathy with the victims of gender-based
violence. Dr Jordaan has, however, after careful consideration decided to
assert his innocence. Whilst Dr Jordaan supports public debate as an essential
tool to highlight the issue of gender-based violence, however, in this case
there are two opposing versions that cannot be resolved in the media, or
elsewhere, in substitution for a court of law. 
Mediation, as suggested by Ms Ferguson, runs the risk that the public
will perceive that there is a cover-up away from the glare of public scrutiny;
and that there is one law for the powerful and another for the masses. "We have accordingly, as his attorneys, advised Dr
Jordaan that he must not participate in a public discourse of the allegation
made against him by Ms Ferguson.  From a legal viewpoint, serious allegations of the kind made
by Ms Ferguson can only be ventilated in a court of law, where the rights of
all parties are protected." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
