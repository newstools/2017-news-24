	     Bangui - A company working in Central African Republic on a UN contract says it has fired a driver who took bribes to transport Muslim civilians to safer parts of the country amid rising sectarian violence. Dubai-based ECOLOG International said on Tuesday that it has terminated the employee implicated in the matter. A UN document obtained by The Associated Press last month said Muslim civilians had been found aboard a convoy in August. Others based in the town of Bangassou confirmed some had paid $100 each for a ride to the capital. Taking money from civilians for transport aboard UN convoys is forbidden by UN policy. ECOLOG, which has a $53m contract with the UN mission in Central African Republic, says it has strengthened its education of employees on UN policies. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
