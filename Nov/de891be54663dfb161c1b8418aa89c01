	     Pretoria – Three men were arrested following a shootout that ensued after they allegedly tried to steal a car from a church in Waterkloof, Pretoria, on Thursday morning.  The suspects allegedly tried to steal a Toyota Corolla in the parking lot of a church when they were caught in the act by Hi-Risk Security personnel. Police spokesperson Captain Colette Weilbach said the suspects opened fire at the security guards who then returned fire. The men fled in a getaway vehicle, also a Toyota Corolla, with police in pursuit, said Weilbach. "The suspects also shot at members from the South African Police Service (SAPS) Brooklyn when they joined the chase. "The suspects lost control of their vehicle in Clark Street, a few blocks away from the church. Three suspects were immediately arrested by the police and the security guards on the scene," Weilbach said. One of the suspects had sustained a gunshot wound and received medical treatment from the Hi-Risk Security medical unit before being taken to a local hospital.   "The fourth suspect managed to escape," she said. The three suspects, who are all in their thirties, will appear in the Hatfield Community Court soon on charges of attempted theft of motor vehicle, possession of car breaking implements and attempted murder. Brooklyn SAPS acting station commander Colonel Terrence Naidoo congratulated the police officers and security guards involved in the incident for their sterling work and partnership in apprehending the suspects.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
