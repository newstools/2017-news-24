Harare – Reports on Monday indicated that students at the University of Zimbabwe had vowed not to write examinations until President Robert Mugabe stepped down. See pic below Zimbabweans were left angered and confused after President Robert Mugabe failed to resign, but instead delivered a cryptic speech on Sunday. Reports on social media said that students had "locked up their lecturers in exam hall/venue refusing to write exams before Mugabe goes". Mugabe faced the threat of impeachment by his own Zanu-PF party if he did not resign by noon on Monday.  The students also demanded that First Lady Grace Mugabe’s PHD be revoked. The university awarded Grace an PHD in orphanages in 2014. The students, according to a NewsDay report, demanded that the university Vice Chancellor Levy Nyagura provides an explanation of how Grace received a doctorate. #UZProtest - University of Zimbabwe students refuse to write exams unti #MugabeMustGo + demand #GraceMugabe PHD to be revoked - 20 Nov 2017 #Zimbabwe #ZimCoup #ZimbabweCoup #Mugabe #MugabeMustFall pic.twitter.com/E5M6twHr6e University of Zimbabwe (UZ) students protest.
