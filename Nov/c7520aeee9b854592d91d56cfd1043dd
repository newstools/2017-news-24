	     Cape Town - The mother of a murdered six-month-old baby on Friday said she was disgusted that some of the people accused of killing her daughter planned to apply for bail ahead of their trial in the Western Cape High Court. Cindy Woodward, the mother of Zahnia Woodward, was outraged after it was revealed during proceedings on Friday that the suspects arrested for her infant’s murder wanted to be released ahead of their trial. Christopher September, Larry Johnson, Taswill Kriel, Morné May, Mirriam Johnson and Simaney Kido are accused of killing Zahnia in Ocean View in December last year. Judge Robert Henney appeared unimpressed when the State informed him of the suspects’ intentions, saying he wanted proper reasons to explain why the application should even be considered. The application should have been made at the Magistrate’s Court. "How can this even be considered?" an incensed Woodward asked outside the court. "Two of them are already out on bail".
