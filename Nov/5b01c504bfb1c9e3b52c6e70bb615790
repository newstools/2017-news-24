	     Port Elizabeth - Three police officers from the New Brighton police station in Port Elizabeth have been arrested for defeating the ends of justice, after allegedly failing to hand over a laptop collected in a murder investigation.  The three officers were part of an investigation into a kidnapping and subsequent murder investigation, after four men were abducted at gun point in KwaZakele on November 16. Their bodies were found last week.  READ: Police hunt for abducted Eastern Cape men's killers Motherwell Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie, said the family who had reported the case at the New Brighton police station, had said they had handed over a laptop over to the police.  The serious violent crime task team detectives investigated the claim and it was discovered that the laptop had not been handed in.  The officers aged 33, 36 and 36, were subsequently arrested and will appear in the New Brighton Magistrates Court on Monday. Rabie said the arrests should serve as a warning that "police members that cross the line will cross the entry into prison". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
