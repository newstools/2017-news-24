 @Nickymccain A dedicated task team has resulted in a safer and cleaner Grand Parade. This was highlighted at the annual meeting of the Cape Town Central City Improvement District (CCID) held recently. The joint partnership, run by the City of Cape Town, includes the CCID and local police, as well as City departments and Law Enforcement. Stuart Diamond, Mayco member for assets and facilities management, explains that the task team was established last year after safety concerns in this public space in the city centre. “Pickpocketing, selling and using drugs, gambling and robbery are some of the activities the task team has to deal with,” he says. “Officials of the City’s property management, Law Enforcement and social development departments represent the City on the task team.” The task team has arrested a number of people who had drugs on them – often on a daily basis, Diamond explains. They also frequently confiscate stolen goods. Daily clean-up operations are being conducted. Diamond explains that the task team aims to “ensure a safe environment where visitors and traders can enjoy one of the oldest and most well-known open spaces in Cape Town”. “Visitors have the right to shop in a safe environment and the City would like to see more people visiting the Grand Parade.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
