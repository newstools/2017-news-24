	     Johannesburg - Private airline Airlink says all 34 passengers and four crew members were unharmed after one of its planes made an emergency landing at OR Tambo International Airport on Wednesday evening. On Thursday, spokesperson Karin Murray said an Avro RJ85 airliner operating flight SA8103 from Harare to Johannesburg made the emergency landing at around 20:40. "While en route one of the four engines suffered an uncontained failure which then caused damage to its adjacent engine," Murray said.    READ: Airlink flight makes emergency landing at OR Tambo Murray said upon assessing the damage and status of the aircraft, the crew decided to continue to Johannesburg where it landed safely under the power of its remaining two engines.
