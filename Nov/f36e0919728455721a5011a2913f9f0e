	     Johannesburg – Sunnyside police have made it their business to keep cells full and streets clean during the holidays as they look for ways to ensure a crime-free festive season. "The local police are pulling out all stops to ensure that persons accused of trio crime related incidents spend the festive season behind bars, which could also contribute towards creating a safer environment during this period," police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela told News 24 on Monday. He was speaking after four men, accused of separate hijacking incidents, discovered that they would have to spend Christmas behind bars because their bid for bail had been refused. Mavimbela said two of the alleged hijackers were denied bail in the Pretoria Magistrate's Court after their arrest last month for possession of a hijacked VW Polo and an unlicensed firearm. The other two alleged hijackers were also denied bail, following their arrest in Mamelodi about two months ago, Mavimbela added. He said the duo had crashed a BMW they allegedly hijacked in Sunnyside. Mavimbela said that some of the men had previous conviction and others had pending cases."This further strengthens the local police argument that repeat offenders are predominantly responsible for serious and violent crimes in the area." Mavimbela warned motorists are warned to be cautious when driving in Sunnyside as the festive season looms.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
