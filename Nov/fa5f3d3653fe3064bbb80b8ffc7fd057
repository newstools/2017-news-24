	     In this week's episode, News24 politics journalist Tshidi Madia speaks to Zimbabwe's only independent member of Parliament and former Zanu-PF member, Temba Mliswa, who pins the current developments in Zimbabwe on Grace Mugabe. He accuses the first lady of trying to usurp her husband's powers and mandate as the elected leader of the country. "The ZDF cannot take orders from the first lady, it takes them from the president. But orders are now coming in from the first lady." LISTEN.  We also go to the streets of Zimbabwe to hear what some of the citizens' make of the current 'military coup', and catch up with News24's team in Harare.  Once you've listened, share the podcast with your circle, and let us know what you think of this week's topic by voting in the poll below.
