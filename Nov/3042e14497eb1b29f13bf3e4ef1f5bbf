	     Nairobi - The head of a Kenyan observers' group says the October 26 repeat presidential election faced challenges that were "not conducive" for a free and fair process. Regina Opondo, chair of the Elections Observation Group, told Kenyan television on Wednesday that "the environment was not secure" in some areas during the vote, which the main opposition group boycotted. Opondo says it is doubtful that Kenya's election commission was able to conduct "significant and comprehensive voter education" ahead of the vote, a rerun of the August election that was nullified by the Supreme Court over irregularities. The Elections Observation Group says ruling party representatives were present in 80% of polling stations that the group observed, while representatives from other parties were at just under 3% of those stations.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
