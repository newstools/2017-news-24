                 Closing and thanksgiving being done at the anti-corruption round table discussion. @TeamNews24 #SAAgainstCorruption https://t.co/egF9ARkFhP Here I am talking about our communication work. We are certainly going to do more of these dialogues and let you know about case successes pic.twitter.com/5Zy3SSt5fR #SAFightingCorruption: The Hawks brigadier says Treasury forms critical part of the #StateCapture investigations. @TeamNews24 #GuptaLeaks: Why NPA won't act Despite mounting calls for action on the #GuptaLeaks,
 prosecutors guiding the investigation into state capture believe the 
emails do not constitute evidence against President Jacob Zuma's 
friends, the Guptas or any ministers and individuals implicated in the 
massive tranche of information.  The NPA IS being judged by what they are doing in court, the fact that they are avoiding dealing with @SAPresident. It's all good and well cutting off branches, but the root cause needs to be weeded out as well #SAFightingCorruption #SAFightingCorruption: A brigadier from the Hawks say they are investigating the issue of #StateCapture. @TeamNews24 #SAFightingCorruption:  Responding to questions, Govender says it was incorrect to say there are no cases opened in terms of the #StateCapture. @TeamNews24 #SAFightingCorruption:  "If SA want to judge the NPA, judge us by what we are doing in court," Adv Govender. @TeamNews24 4.State v Samuel Mzukisi Banzana: Accused requested and were paid gratifications in order for contractors to be awarded construction contracts valued R41 174 000.  He was convicted  and sentenced to an effective 12years imprisonment. A confiscation order of R351 000 was attained. The #Hawks should be dismantled & the #Scorpion should be reinstated. It is clear that the Hawks, NPA, SAPS  & other government entities are sitting on mountain of evidence for years now without prosecuting anyone. We are beyond captured. 3. State v Mduduzi Mkhize:  Employee at Dep of Educ in KZN formed part of a syndicate who made use of key loggers to obtain info from Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Municipality to transfer R19 722 000. @TeamNews24 2.State v AC Scholtz and others: ANC Provincial secretary convicted of corruption and money laundering worth R600million. @TeamNews24 1.State v Petrus Meyer: SARS official who assisted Arthur Webb (member of both Webb's Arms and Ammunitions CC and Scarlet Dawn Trading 59CC) to submit fraudulent VAT 201 returns valued R4 190 310,43. @TeamNews24 #SAFightingCorruption Govender says if SA wants to judge the NPA, "judge us by what we are doing in court." #SAFightingCorruption: The number of finalised serious corruption cases in respect of the public sector was 5. @TeamNews24 #GCISMedia adv Govender of NPA says it’s erroneous to say #Hawks have been captured - their silence is because they’re constrained nPA does not litigate through the media but it does not mean we are not doing our work says Adv Govender Former NWU employee jailed for stealing millions A former North West University senior
financial officer has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for
stealing more than R17m in student loans. #SAFightingCorruption: When asked about the NPA allowing Zuma to make representations in his corruption case, Adv Govender says they will always consider representations from any accused in any case and not president specifically. @TeamNews24 2.State v Bradley Freeman and others: NWU university employee altered banking details of Edu-loan and other service providers to that of his own and had money deposited into his account. Money was then laundered to family members worth R17,769,064. @TeamNews24 #SAFightingCorruption Govender answering my question on NPA allowing President to make representations in his corruption case. 1.State v EUS (Pty)LTD and others: Accused were charged with fraud and money laundering involving an amount of R65 million where Eskom and its subsidiary were defrauded. @TeamNews24 Litigants in high value cases tend to litigate on peripheral issues even before case can be argued on its merits in a trial...can take years to finalise in court. That's in addition to long investigations coz of complexity pic.twitter.com/d5HYvJE2DK #SAFightingCorruption: Referring to the John Block case, Adv Govender says they have a conviction but the person is not in prison yet. @TeamNews24 Accused 9 – John Fikile Block was sentenced to 15years imprisonment in respect of corruption and 12years of money laundering charge. The AFU confiscated orders of R63 million against accused 1-7 and R2.7 million against accused Block. @TeamNews24 The companies being accused 2-7 were convicted of corruption and money laundering – fined R75 000 and R150 000. Accused 8 died during the course of trial. @TeamNews24 Sentenced to 15years imprisonment each in respect of 2 corruption charges 5years imprisonment, 12years imprisonment in respect of each in respect of 2 money laundering charges. @TeamNews24 #SAFightingCorruption: Adv Govender refers to State v AC Scholtz and others: ANC Provincial secretary convicted of corruption and money laundering worth R600million. @TeamNews24 #SAFightingCorruption: Adv Govender says the case against John Block stands out for her. @TeamNews24 #SAFightingCorruption: Davids says they will have an in depth consultative process with stakeholders to find out what the best strategy is. @TeamNews24 Adv Knorx Molelle of AFU and Adv Malini Govender of the SCCU provide a report about the work of these NPA units in fighting corruption. The NPA's mandate doesn't include investigations pic.twitter.com/oDzkxuQt9W #SAFightingCorruption: According to Davids SA has never had a unified approach to fighting corruption. @TeamNews24 #SAFightingCorruption: Roderick Davids from the Sub Committee: National Anti-Corruption Strategy is up next. @TeamNews24 #SAFightingCorruption: Molelle says his department has also recorded its best performance ever. @TeamNews24 #SAFightingCorruption Adv Molelle says the most interesting asset seized was cattle. @TeamNews24 #SAFightingCorruption: Adv Molelle says his job is simply to follow the money. @TeamNews24 #SAFightingCorruption: Adv Knorx Molelle from the Asset Forfeiture Unit is up next. Molelle says they work closely with Saps and the Hawks and other role players.  @TeamNews24 #SAFightingCorruption: Adv Govender says her unit's focus is on higher level cases of complex organised corruption. @TeamNews24 #SAFightingCorruption: Adv Govender says they have met 88% of their targets. The best since 1998.  She says none of this was reported in the media. @TeamNews24 #SAFightingCorruption Adv Malini Govender, from the Specialised Commercial Crimes Unit, starts by saying NPA does not do investigations. #SAFightingCorruption:  Adv Visagie says the SUI then reports back to the president once investigations is completed. @TeamNews24 #SAFightingCorruption Adv Visagie says when the SUI receive allegations of corruption they sent a motivation to the presidency for approval. @TeamNews24 #SAFightingCorruption Adv Visagie says SA has multi-agency approach to fighting corruption. The SIU is one of them. @TeamNews24 Shaun Abrahams takes front stage after emerging from hibernation National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams, who has adopted
 an almost hermit-like existence of late, has finally emerged in 
public.  Adv Gerhard Visagie from the Special Investigating Unit is the next speaker. Visagie says the SUI investigates and then prosecutes.   @TeamNews24
