	     Cape Town - A Delft family has been dealt a double blow
after two its members were killed in separate incidents in the space of a week. Mkhuseli Bixa said they were left heartbroken after Okuhle
Duduzile Bixa, 31, his niece, was shot dead two weeks ago. A week before that, on October 22, Bixa’s grandson, Bunono
Poni, 4, was allegedly stabbed to death at the hands of an uncle. A tearful Bixa said: "We were still preparing to bury
Bunono when this tragedy struck ... Duduzile was busy with arrangements for
Bunono’s funeral (at the time of her death). This has worsened our pain." Bixa said they were told that Duduzile died after an unknown
gunman shot her as she was walking home with her friend. They made off with her cellphone. "That statement does not add up because the blood on
the scene shows that she was not shot there. It is clear that she was shot
somewhere else and they moved her body to the scene thereafter. We are also
worried that she still had R250 cash in her pockets after the 'robbery'. "Her cellphone was still on a day after she was
allegedly shot. We hope that the truth will prevail," Bixa said. After she was found, Duduzile, who ran a salon, was rushed
to the day hospital where she was declared dead on arrival. Her memorial service was held at TRA5 Delft Temporals on
Sunday. Bunono's alleged killer was arrested and is due to appear in
the Bellville Magistrate’s Court on December 5. Bunono will be buried on Saturday in Tsolo, in the Eastern
Cape. The police were not available for comment on Bunono's death. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
