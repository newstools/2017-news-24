	     Johannesburg - The Heher Commission into the Feasibility of
Fee-Free Higher Education and Training has found that there is currently no
capacity for the state to provide free tertiary education to all students in
the country.  "…There is insufficient financial capacity in the state
to provide totally free higher education and training to all who are unable to
finance their own education, let alone to all students, whether in need or

be funded through a cost-sharing model of government guaranteed
"Income-Contingency Loans" sourced from commercial banks.  More to follow. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
