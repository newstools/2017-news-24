 President Jacob Zuma has denied that he received
any undisclosed money from private individuals or companies during his term as
president.  This was Zuma's answer to an urgent question put on the order paper
by DA leader Mmusi Miamane for Thursday's question session in the National
Assembly, relating to allegations that he had received monthly payments of R1m
from Roy Moodley, without declaring it to the South African Revenue Service.  Next question:  ANC MP Mohlopi Mapulane wants to know if the government is currently able to effectively manage the 
consequences of climate change, especially its impact on the economy. IFP's Mkhuleko Hlengwa is again asking how much litigation matters is costing taxpayers.  "I don't keep records of the state about litigation involving the government," says Zuma. "We demand answers", says Maimane.  "Be calm, you don't have to beat up tables here," says deputy speaker Lechesa Tsenoli.
