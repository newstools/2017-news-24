Derrick Spies, Correspondent KwaMashu - Three people, including a pregnant woman and a 3-year-old, toddler died when the wall of their house collapsed due to heavy rains in KwaMashu's L Section in the early hours of Saturday morning.  The names of three are known, but are being withheld as their family members have not yet been informed. Further information on the deaths was not immediately available. KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Nomusa Dube-Ncube sent condolences to the family. "As the provincial government we are really saddened by what has happened here in KwaMashu and we have dispatched disaster management teams to support and provide assistance to the family during this difficult time."   Dube-Ncube urged communities to exercise caution over the weekend as heavy rains, coupled with hail and strong winds, were expected to hit areas in the coastal, central and northern parts of the province, specifically uMgungundlovu, uThukela, Amajuba, UMzinyathi, Zululand, eThekwini and Ilembe.  "We urge residents not to take unnecessary risks like crossing rivers or swollen streams where water is above their ankles.  "Motorists we urge to drive slowly as roads are slippery and if they are trapped with their vehicle in rising water, they should abandon it and immediately seek higher ground." Residents were urged to follow news reports on radio and television for updates on the situation across the province.  Photos supplied    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
