Diabetes now kills more people than HIV/AIDS and cancer together.  “There were approximately 3.5 million cases of diabetes in South Africa in 2016,” says Margot McCumisky, National Manager of Diabetes SA.  “Many people with diabetes do not have symptoms, which is why it is important to go for blood glucose testing.  “Early diagnosis of diabetes is extremely important for complications to be prevented or delayed,” McCumisky continues.  The Lions International President      Dr. Naresh Aggarwal has called upon Lions and Leos across the globe to carry out activities that address the global diabetes epidemic in the communities they serve. Free diabetes tests The Uitenhage Lions, Uitenhage Lioness and Leo Clubs have taken up the request and will be conducting free diabetes tests for the community.  They will be held on Saturday, November 11th from 09:00 to 12:00 at Levyvale Superspar in Uitenhage.  “There will be three professional nursing staff assisting in this awareness campaign. The public is encouraged to participate in  addressing this ‘silent killer’ disease,” said Lion President Hein de Vrey. The free diabetes tests are for all interested. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
