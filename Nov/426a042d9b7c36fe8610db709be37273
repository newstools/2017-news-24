SAWS warned residents to stay indoors and not to attempt to cross rivers. While the storm was not expected to be as severe as the mega-storm that hit parts of the province in October, SAWS said anyone not indoors should still remain on alert. The KwaZulu-Natal provincial legislature officially declared the storm a provincial disaster on October 12, following the devastating impact the heavy rains had on several districts across the province.
