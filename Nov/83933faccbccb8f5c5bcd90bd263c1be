	     Johannesburg – Conflicting witness statements have "complicated" the investigation into the two men accused of assaulting a man in front of Mugg & Bean at the Tambotie Mall in Randfontein, Gauteng police said on Wednesday.  Krugersdorp Police spokesperson Captain Appel Ernst, however, said police cannot divulge the cause of the altercation, which took place on Saturday, at this stage.  "The investigation is at an advanced and sensitive stage," Ernst told News24. She said the two men, aged 20 and 25, arrested for the assault were released on bail on Sunday.  A court date for their appearance has not yet been set.  "We are going to conclude our investigations first," she said.
