	     Durban – Police are investigating a case of robbery after eight suspects ransacked the home of the Consul-General of India in Durban, police said. Dr Shashank Vikram was with his five-year-old son when the men broke down the doors to his house in Innes Road in Berea at about 16:15 on Thursday, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane told News24. "A 36-year-old victim and his son were at their place of residence when unidentified suspects entered. The victims activated a panic button and locked themselves in the bedroom," said Zwane. However, by the time the police and security guards arrived at the property, the robbers had already fled. They took jewellery, he added. Dr Vikram has been living in Durban for more than a year. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
