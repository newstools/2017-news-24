	     Cape Town - Two people were arrested in the Wynberg CBD on Thursday 16 November for operating an illegal laboratory to make dentures. A joint operation by Wynberg police officers, the South African Dental Technicians Council and the Health Professions Council of South Africa led to a raid where the two men were arrested.  Wynberg police spokesperson Captain Ntomboxolo Nqunqela says they had received a tip-off.  The men were charged with operating an illegal laboratory, illegally making dentures and possession of unmounted artificial teeth without a permit.  “We confiscated unmounted artificial teeth, dentures and equipment,” says Nqunqela.  “These unregistered laboratories are putting the lives of the public at risk and this will not be tolerated as such people are encroaching on a professional territory and breaking the law,” she says. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
