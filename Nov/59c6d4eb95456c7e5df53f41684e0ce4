	     The dedicated service by staff members of the Sinethemba Special Care Centre has been acknowledged. The years of service of three employees of the centre, Maria Jam (10 years), Martina Boyes (25 years) and Jennifer Christians (30 years), were recently awarded at the annual meeting of the Fish Hoek Kommetjie Noordhoek Welfare Association (FHKNWA). “These awards go to show the dedication, loyalty and passion of the staff who work for the centre,” says the centre’s Jackie Smit. The centre is a non-profit organisation that focuses on working with people with special needs in Masiphumelele, Ocean View, Simon’s Town, Red Hill, Scarborough, Kommetjie, Sunnydale, Glencairn, Noordhoek and Fish Hoek. The centre is the main project of the FHKNWA and is based in Masiphumelele. The day care centre currently cares for 50 children with various disabilities, including cerebral palsy, foetal alcohol syndrome and Down syndrome.  At the annual meeting, the association also honoured Dawn Hare who helped get the centre started.
