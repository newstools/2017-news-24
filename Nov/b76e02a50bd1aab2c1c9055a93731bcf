	     Mansoura - A prison-themed restaurant in Egypt might seem distasteful. After all, Egypt is a country where thousands of people, mostly Islamists but also secular pro-democracy activists, are languishing in jail on what right groups say are trumped-up charges. Yet, the restaurant in the coastal city of Mansoura called "Food Crime" is doing good business because of its novelty, according to patrons. Props like handcuffs, inmate number plaques, a prisoners' cage and even an electric chair are served up as welcome selfie-fodder. Naeem is irked by anyone who tries to link the restaurant's theme to the large-scale crackdown on dissent since the military ousted an Islamist president in 2013. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
