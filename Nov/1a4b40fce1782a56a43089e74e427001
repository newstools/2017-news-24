	     Nairobi- A witness says one person has been shot dead as Kenyan police try to block opposition supporters from holding a memorial for the dozens of people killed in recent months while protesting President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election. Kenyatta was being sworn in elsewhere in the capital, Nairobi, on Tuesday. Human rights groups and others say nearly 100 people have been killed since the August 8 election that was nullified by the Supreme Court following a challenge by opposition leader Raila Odinga, citing fraud. Some of them were killed in protests seeking electoral reforms ahead of the repeat election on October 26.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
