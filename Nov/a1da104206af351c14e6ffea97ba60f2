The mascot was introduced to the children giving them time to energise their bodies, run around the playing field singing and dancing with Max. Principal Roslyn Caldwell said it was exciting for the little ones, although some were a bit scared of Max at first, but later warmed up to him and had loads of fun. “It was so amazing for Bidvest Bank to call me out of the blue, saying they would like to visit our school. It means a lot to know there are people who care about our children with special needs. It is also amazing that a group of ladies took the initiative,” said Caldwell. Backpacks, sweets, hotdogs, water bottles, speakers and stationery were some of the goodies Bidvest Bank gave to the children. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
