	     Hundreds gathered at the Kasarani Stadium in Nairobi on Tuesday to witness the inauguration of Uhuru Kenyatta, who was sworn in for a second term as Kenya president. Kenyatta's controversial win in the August elections resulted in a second vote. Watch.WATCH   Nairobi - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is among the leaders attending the inauguration of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta as Israel pursues closer diplomatic ties with the African continent. Netanyahu has said his intention also is to forge links with countries with whom Israel does not have diplomatic relations. He has said he hopes that by the end of Tuesday an announcement will be made about a new Israeli embassy in an African country. Israel played a prominent role in assisting newly independent African countries in the 1960s, but those relations crumbled in the 1970s when Arab countries, promising aid, pressured African nations to limit or cut ties. African states also were opposed to Israel's close ties to South Africa's apartheid government. In exchange for expertise in security and other fields, Israel now wants African states to side with it at the United Nations, where the General Assembly overwhelmingly recognised Palestine as a non-member observer state in 2012.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
