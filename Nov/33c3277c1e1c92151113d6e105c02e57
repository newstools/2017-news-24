	     Mutare – Zimbabwe's former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa's allies are reportedly likely going to be purged from both government and the ruling Zanu-PF party after President Robert Mugabe sacked him from his post. According to New Zimbabwe.com, several Zanu-PF top officials from Manicaland who supported Mnangagwa could be booted out after the Provincial Co-ordination Committee recommended their expulsion.  Chaired by provincial chairperson and Energy minister Samuel Undenge, the PCC recommended that Mnangagwa’s allies be dealt with "with immediate effect". The senior Zanu-PF officials who were likely to be booted out were; "ex-Zanu-PF women’s league boss and Water Affairs Minister Oppah Machinguri, former finance minister and now Cyber Security Minister Patrick Chinamasa, Deputy Minister for Postal and telecommunication Win Mlambo as well as former information minister Chris Mushowe." Mugabe on Monday fired his deputy as tensions between Mnangagwa and the veteran leader's wife Grace to succeed him intensified. Grace declared over the weekend that Mnangagwa should be gone from both the government and Zanu-PF before the party's extraordinary congress in December. Mnangagwa was the leading contender to succeed Mugabe, 93, but his abrupt removal appeared to clear the way for Grace to take over.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
