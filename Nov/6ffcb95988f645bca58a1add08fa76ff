With Christmas around the corner, Levana Primary School in Lavender Hill is working on a musical which will help the school raise funds for a library for the school and community. School principal Andre Lamprecht hopes that people can help to make their Rene Roman Library a reality by buying tickets.  The library will be named after one of the school’s learners, Rene Roman (13), who was raped and murdered in March while in Grade 6 at the school.  The case of the man accused of her murder was recently transferred to the Western Cape High Court from Wynberg Magistrate’s Court. The school approached Rodger Hughes, who had previously put on a successful Christmas musical titled Little Baby Boy.  Hughes is a member of the New Apostolic Church and gained the necessary permission to do the musical with New Apostolic Church musicians from various areas around the school.  The musical will glow with the spirit of Christmas as it tells the events leading up to the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem. The production carries on seamlessly from start to finish. A narrator will map out the journey and the angel Gabriel, Mary, Joseph, the innkeeper and Mary’s sister Elizabeth will enthrall the audience with their emotive singing and realistic acting.  Performances will take place at the New Apostolic Church, corner of 8th Avenue and Dieman Road, Grassy Park on Friday 15 December at 20:00, Sunday 17 December at 19:00 and Monday 18 December at 20:00. Tickets cost R50 each. Levana Primary was established in 1977. Since then it has served the communities of Lavender Hill, Hillview, Seawinds and St Montague Village, as well as neighbouring informal settlements.  Lamprecht says the communities they serve are very poor and disadvantaged and violence, substance abuse and lack of parental guidance are issues the school struggles with daily.  “The vision of the school is to develop learners so that they can become confident adults with strong morals, norms and values. The school is a non-fee paying school with an enrolment of 1051 learners from Grade R to Grade 7. Levana continually faces new challenges and obstacles, however, it strives to give the children the best possible education. For some time now the school has been in the process of building a school library and we hope the musical will help us raise the much-needed funds,” he says. The library will not only be for school use but will also be used as a community activity centre or community library.  “The challenges within the community are vast, and undertaking such a project will create promise and interest within the community. For that reason the school believes a large part of the community will be positively affected,” says Lamprecht.
