In this week's episode – News24 politics editor Mahlatse Mahlase
speaks to Sox Chikowero, a former member of the Zimbabwean Defence force, who
was tortured by President Robert Mugabe's regime. Chikowero says he is
cautiously optimistic as Mugabe bows out and Emmerson Mnangagwa steps in.  Mnangagwa was sworn in as
the new president of Zimbabwe on Friday 24 November. This marked the final
chapter of a political drama that toppled his predecessor Robert Mugabe after a
military takeover.  It was also a week of denials by Public Enterprises minister Lynne
Brown and former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe at the Eskom enquiry in
Parliament.  Once you've listened, share the podcast with your circle and let
