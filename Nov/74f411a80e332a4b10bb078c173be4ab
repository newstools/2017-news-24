	     Johannesburg - The South African Security Forces Union (SASFU) has called on President Jacob Zuma to investigate and reverse the military's appointment of Brian Molefe.  In a statement, Sasfu president Charles Jacobs said Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula had to reverse the decision and recover all monies paid to Molefe, as well as launch an investigation into the matter, taking appropriate action. "It is our view that this is a case of corruption," he said.  READ:  Brown, Eskom board to face state capture inquiry - source Jacobs said Sasfu shall not sit back and watch the integrity of the defence force dragged through the mud.
