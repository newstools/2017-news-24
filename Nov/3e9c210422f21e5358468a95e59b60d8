	     Harare – Former Zimbabwean vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa
has reportedly arrived in China following his dismissal from his post by
President Robert Mugabe on Monday.  A report by New Zimbabwe.com quoted a military source as
saying that Mnangagwa's journey was made possible by the country's faction
riddled war veterans head Chris Mutsvangwa.  Mutsvangwa himself was the former ambassador to China. "He (Mnangagwa is now in China. War veterans chairperson
Christopher Mutsvangwa facilitated the journey," the military source was quoted
as saying.  Mutsvangwa could neither deny nor confirm the developments,
referring all questions to Mnangagwa's family, the report said. Verbal attacks  Mutsvangwa addressed a press conference in Johannesburg
earlier this week where he announced that the Zimbabwe’s War Veterans Association
had expelled Mugabe as its leader. "We have completely disowned Mugabe," said Mutsvangwa.   Mugabe on Monday fired Munangagwa, the man who for so long looked like he would succeed the longtime
Zimbabwe president.  This came after Mugabe - and
particularly his wife Grace - had been stepping up their verbal attacks on
Mnangagwa, 75, for weeks. The first couple were outraged
when Grace was booed at a rally in Bulawayo on Saturday. That was blamed
on Mnangagwa bussing in his supporters. Grace led exactly the
same charge against a vice president in 2014, when she got Joice Mujuru fired.  Reports on Friday indicated that four people had since been taken to court for allegedly booing the first lady. They faced a charge of undermining the authority of the president. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
