SINCE the inception of the Community Work Programme (CWP) in Umzimkhulu, many lives have been changed for the better as they received vegetable gardening skills. Umzimkhulu has many rural villages where people depend on farming and agriculture­ to live, and make a living. When the CWP was introduced by government in 2012, unemployed people grabbed the opportunity and were taught about gardening­, home-based care and clinic and hospital cleaning. “Many young people now produce vegetables for sale to shops, and also donate to poor families. Poverty is now a thing of the past in many homes because of the programme,” said Ziyanda Mkhulisi, who manages the CWP in Umzimkhulu. She said young people have been taught how to hold awareness campaigns, which has yielded positive results. In Ward 1, 14 young people’s lives have changed through the programme. Willy Mgcina, the Umzimkhulu Local Municipality communication officer, said 1 029 people from all Umzimkhulu wards are participating in the programme and are receiving support and tools from government. Ibisi women who farm cabbage thanked government for the programme.
