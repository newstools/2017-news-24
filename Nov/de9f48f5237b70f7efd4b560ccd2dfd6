	     Ouagadougou - The French presidency's spokesperson says stones have been thrown at a vehicle transporting members of the French delegation accompanying President Emmanuel Macron's visit to Burkina Faso. Bruno Roger-Petit said on his official Twitter account Macron was meeting with his counterpart, President Roch Marc Christian Kabore, when the incident happened. He said no vehicle was destroyed in the incident and there were not "hundreds of assailants." The incident happened as Macron was expected to make his first big speech in Africa at the University of Ouagadougou, amid threats of demonstrations. Burkina Faso's government has ordered schools closed to ease traffic because of the heavy security measures in place during Macron's visit, though many view the closures as an effort to reduce the threat of student unrest.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
