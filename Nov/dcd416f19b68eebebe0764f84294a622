Adjourned to Wednesday @TeamNews24 Mihalik says he has no more questions for Nader. State has no re-examination. Nader excused. #JasonRohde Panieri-Peter is in the public gallery. Nader said she crossed out Dr LPP's report that said Susan ''was a suicide risk'' and put in ''could be a suicide risk''. But her crossing out does not show on Dr LPP's report @TeamNews24 Dr Larissa Panieri-Peter is a specialist forensic psychiatrist located in Cape Town. She deals with psycho-legal assessments concerning both criminal and civil cases. Mihalik asking Nader about a report specialist Dr Larissa Panieri Peter wrote, and Nader was asked to read.

She eventually got hold of Jason who said he couldn't speak but would explain later On 27th Jason #Rohde told Nader  about Sue, he was crying. She had died on 24th. @TeamNews24 The session of 20/7/2016 was very stormy. Jason #Rohde walked in and said he was angry as didn't want to attend that day. Susan had fetched him from work. @TeamNews24 #JasonRohde Jason spoke of the affair with Jolene Alterskye and said he wished he'd never met her Between 8 April and 24 May sessions, marked improvement in Susan #Rohde. Started working on improving relationship, teaching listening, how to speak to each other @TeamNews24 Jason #Rohde complained that Sue keeps asking the same questions. Checked for suicidal ideation. Told Jason to take her to a clinic if he was worried. Followed up with an SMS, they did not reply. @TeamNews24 Susan #Rohde exhibited low tolerance for mental and emotional pain, showed rage, felt everybody else was happy, wanted to keep up appearances @TeamNews24 #JasonRohde Jason said the affair started in June 2015 & that he'd ended it. He did not want a divorce and feared losing Susan Susan #Rohde appeared to be isolating herself. She was doing a lot of gym, lost 8 to 10kg, paced in room, erratic behaviour, insomnia, jumpy, says Nader @TeamNews24 Nader noted Susan felt traumatised saying they were happy, been married for 22 yrs and had 28 year relationship.

Newcombe diagnosed her with anxiety and previously told the court that at no time did she feel that Susan was at risk of suicide. Last week in the #Rohde trial we heard that Susan became so distressed during marriage counselling that there was a suggestion that she be admitted for treatment @TeamNews24 Back at the Western Cape High Court as prosecution and defence try to determine whether Susan #Rohde killed herself or whether her husband Jason had a hand in her death @TeamNews24 pic.twitter.com/gRWHuK9AcM Rohde case back in court The murder case of property boss Jason Rohde will continue in the Western Cape High Court on Monday. In a previous sitting, the court heard how Susan Rohde threatened that she felt like dying in the weeks leading up to her death. Susan was found hanging from the back of her bathroom door in a Cape Town hotel. The couple attended a Lew Geffen Sotheby's International Realtors conference at the time. Susan had earlier discovered that Jason was having an affair with Cape Town estate agent Jolene Alterskye. Alterskye was also at the conference and Susan met her briefly.
