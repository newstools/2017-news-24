                 Ligature mark on Susan Rohde "dubiously low" and indicates post-mortem placement in a seated position most likely to conceal a manual strangulation. Court adjourns to tomorrow. (Thursday, 23 November) ICYMI: There were signs of a physical altercation before strangulation which lasted more than a few minutes, and could have lasted up to an hour, he said. Blood was found in Susan's stomach and small intestine. Khan thought she might have coughed up blood and then swallowed it. He had been on first call so he went out. She was not on call. It was a medical officer or diploma-ed person on second call.  He called her because there was blood on the bedding, pillow in bedroom, faeces around body on different sites, and he found mark around her neck. Prosecutor Louis van Niekerk says pictures can help with the cause of broken ribs. CK says it could have been blunt force trauma, or when she fell into the garden bed and small retaining wall during the confrontations with Jason during her last hours.Â  Defence says Coetzee-Khan's comments about Perumal were "outrageous" and Perumal "with respect" reserves his rights. CK says it is up to Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe to interpret what he said @TeamNews24
