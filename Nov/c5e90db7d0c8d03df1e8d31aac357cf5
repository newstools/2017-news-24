                 Ligature mark on Susan Rohde "dubiously low" and indicates post-mortem placement in a seated position most likely to conceal a manual strangulation. Court adjourns to tomorrow. (Thursday, 23 November) Susan's blood alcohol level dropped from 0.05 to 0.03% between first and second autopsy. Not unusual for second autopsy results @TeamNews24 They have forgotten to switch the lights back on so we are in the dark, with a nice picture of Spier  projected on the wall, as Dr Abrahams goes through what she thought of Perumal's private autopsy report @TeamNews24 Abrahams said it might be raised in question that a possible suspect gets to say the cause of death. She notes that Perumal not considered impartial because he was paid by the defence @TeamNews24 Ligature mark on Susan's neck is consistent with a post-mortem placement @TeamNews24 #Rohde trial back on after lunch. Chief pathologist Dr Abrahams said she underlined that the ligature mark on Susan's neck was not made before her death (ante-mortem) @TeamNews24 #Rohde trial adjourned for lunch @TeamNews24 ICYMI: There were signs of a physical altercation before strangulation which lasted more than a few minutes, and could have lasted up to an hour, he said. Blood was found in Susan's stomach and small intestine. Khan thought she might have coughed up blood and then swallowed it. Abrahams does not speak of "Susan" or "Mrs Rohde". She says "the person". In this case, "the person" would not have been breathing well, would have been swallowing blood, in pain @TeamNews24 Jason #Rohde back at his spot on a chair near the witness, head tilted, not looking at pics on wall to his right of his late wife's autopsy.  @TeamNews24 She points out four horizontal scrach marks under the chin and neck region of Susan #Rohde. Abrasion of left upper eyelid, and small mark under left eye. @TeamNews24 Pointer crisis here. Defence's one's battery is flat. Pressing on without one to go over the pics of Susan #Rohde's neck. She points out a scratch mark on right neck at jaw angle @TeamNews24 Abrahams says she noted that Susan #Rohde was declared dead at 09:08 on 24 July, 2016. She concurred with CK that cause of death was:  Unnatural and consistent [with] asphyxia following manual strangulation and external airway obstruction @TeamNews24 Abrahams said she received a copy of Susan #Rohde's autopsy report emailed to her by Coetzee-Khan. She would check for errors, not alter if there were errors, would phone him, point out typing, spelling, calculation errors. He would consider these,complete his report @TeamNews24 Coetzee-Khan started by examing external injuries, swabbing injuries without touching them. Abrahams' role was observe, be available for Coetzee-Khan to discuss what he says as he notes it on a diagram. @TeamNews24 They went through the initial processes of checking who was in attendance, whether they wore protective clothing, whether their kits for the alcohol and drug samples were ready @TeamNews24 #Rohde Abrahams is explaining how Susan #Rohde's body was put into position for the autopsy conducted later @TeamNews24 Dr Coetzee-Khan called Abrahams to tell her that some fo the injuries on Susan #Rohde body did not fit into suicide. She would then also assist because of some of the anomalies he said he found, and because it was a high profile case @TeamNews24 He had been on first call so he went out. She was not on call. It was a medical officer or diploma-ed person on second call.  He called her because there was blood on the bedding, pillow in bedroom, faeces around body on different sites, and he found mark around her neck. She has done about 9000 autopsies. They all included specialist cases, requiring special techniques such as those used on Susan #Rohde @TeamNews24 Dr Deidre Abrahams is sworn in as the #Rohde trial resumes after the tea adjournment @TeamNews24 CK says he thought Susan #Rohde's ribs were broken by blunt force trauma. Could have been from someone pressing down ribs, poss knee on chest. There is not always bruises if ribs are broken, he says @TeamNews24 Prosecutor Louis van Niekerk says pictures can help with the cause of broken ribs. CK says it could have been blunt force trauma, or when she fell into the garden bed and small retaining wall during the confrontations with Jason during her last hours.Â  Prosecutor hands in set of pics numbered 1 - 96 taken by Sgt Van Rooyen at inspection in loco. @TeamNews24 #Rohde Defence says Coetzee-Khan's comments about Perumal were "outrageous" and Perumal "with respect" reserves his rights. CK says it is up to Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe to interpret what he said @TeamNews24 CK says Susan #Rohde's blood was supposed to go back into her body in a packet for Perumal's investigation. VDS says Perumal did not find the blood @TeamNews24 CK explains how a death case is classified "high profile". High media exposure and possible media intrusion, security, managing lots of people - all plays a part @TeamNews24 #Rohde
