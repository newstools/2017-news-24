	     University of Zimbabwe students have vowed not to write examinations until President Robert Mugabe steps down.WATCH Cape Town – The Southern African Development Community
(SADC) is expected to discuss Zimbabwe’s political crisis in Luanda, Angola on
Tuesday, the presidency has said in a statement. The statement said that President Jacob Zuma in his
capacity as chair of SADC "will attend the summit of the SADC Organ Troika Plus
Chairperson of SADC which will take place in Luanda, Angola on Tuesday". The summit was expected to discuss the unfolding developments
in Zimbabwe.  The meeting was set to go on after Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe stunned many on Sunday when he made no reference to his
resignation in a speech aired on national television.    "The
(ruling Zanu-PF) party congress is due in a few weeks and I will preside over
its processes," Mugabe said, pitching the country into further
uncertainty. Many Zimbabweans expected Mugabe to
resign after the army seized power last week. But Mugabe delivered his speech
alongside the uniformed generals who were behind the military intervention. In his address, Mugabe made no
reference to the clamour for him to resign. Instead he paid tribute to three
pillars of power in Zimbabwe - the military, the ruling party and the war
veterans movement - and urged national solidarity.     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
