	     This video may surprise you… This is what journalist Daniëlla Van Heerden captioned a
video of what appears to be three police officers scuffling with another man. In the video, which Daniëlla shared on her Facebook page, three officers are seen grabbing at 27-year-old Wouter
van der Merwe as he struggles to throw them off. A friend of his tries to separate him from the police
officers as the men in uniform murmur, “What is this, is it dagga?” Eventually, Wouter manages to reach into his pocket – and
pulls out a little box.  The camera then turns to focus on his girlfriend Francé Grobler (23) as she tries to back away from
the roadside tussle. Suddenly Wouter gets down
on one knee and opens the box, revealing a sparkling diamond ring inside. He then asks Francé to marry him – revealing the whole
altercation with the policemen was all part of his surprise proposal. Francé appears to be
in absolute shock – but still manages to stammer to her jokester beau: “Of
course I’ll marry you!” The video has since been
viewed on Facebook almost 500 000 times, even sparking a trending hashtag
on social media: #notpolicebrutality. YOU has reached out to Wouter
for comment.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
