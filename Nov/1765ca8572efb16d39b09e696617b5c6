	     THE Heritage Academy’s Reader’s Theatre production was presented on October 24 where the Grade 4s performed a fairy tale. Grade 5 pupils put on Romeo and Juliet, Grade 6 pupils acted out a western, cowboy-themed play and the Grade 7s put on Shakespeare’s Hamlet. In Reader’s Theatre pupils perform by reading scripts. Usually they gain reading skills and confidence by practising reading with a purpose and act without having to learn their lines off by heart. Reader’s Theatre is magical in the way it motivates reluctant readers and affords them the opportunity of exploring their talent.  The magic occurs when pupils get on stage, even if that stage is the floor of the classroom or library. Shy children blossom, and pupils develop a strong sense of working together as a team. - Supplied. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
