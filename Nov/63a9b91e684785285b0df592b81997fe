	     Johannesburg – AngloGold Ashanti has confirmed that two miners who remained trapped underground following a rockfall at a mine near Carletonville earlier on Thursday have been rescued.  Earlier in the day, a rockfall trapped eight miners at the Mponeng mine near Carletonville on Johannesburg's West Rand.  Mine rescue services were able to rescue four miners during the course of the day, and during rescue operations, the bodies of two others were recovered.  AngloGold Ashanti spokesperson Chris Nthite confirmed to News24 that the remaining two miners had been rescued and rushed to hospital.  "We have some good news. The two miners were rescued. They were attended to by paramedics and were taken to hospital in a stable condition," Nthite said. Earlier in the day, Nthite said mine rescuers would continue their operations until all the miners were rescued.  The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said it was "disturbed and saddened" after it learned of the trapped workers.  NUM health and safety secretary Erick Gcilitshana told News24 this was the third incident at the mine in about a month, and there had been similar incidents at other mines in the area this year.  Gcilitshana said the number of earth tremors and subsequent rockfalls were concerning for the union. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
