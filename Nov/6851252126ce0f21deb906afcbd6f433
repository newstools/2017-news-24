                 WATCH: We don't have the basics, can't afford schooling...we are so tired - Zim protester  Zimbabwe: Developments since the military takeover  Here is a timeline of the developing political crisis in Zimbabwe, where the military has taken control of the country but President Robert Mugabe is clinging to power.  Army takes control  - November 14: Tanks are seen moving on the outskirts of the capital a day after army chief Constantino Chiwenga denounces Mugabe's sacking of Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa.  Mnangagwa is seen as a rival of Mugabe's wife Grace, 52, to succeed the veteran 93-year-old leader.  Later, heavy gunfire is heard near Mugabe's residence in Harare.  Military officers deny a coup. In an overnight declaration on state television, they say Mugabe is safe and they are "only targeting criminals around him".  Mugabe under house arrest  - November 15: Military vehicles take control of the streets of Harare from the early hours, controlling access to parliament, ruling party headquarters and the Supreme Court.  South Africa says Mugabe has told its president, Jacob Zuma, by telephone that he is under house arrest but is "fine".  South Africa sends two special envoys to Zimbabwe. The European Union urges a peaceful resolution to the crisis.   Zimbabweans marching side by side military ranks #SADCBackOffZim #Zimbabawe ???? pic.twitter.com/ExhYcZjn9R #SolidarityMarch #ourzimbabwedream #Zimbabwe @TudorBismark @SmangaMad @rchakoreka @rumashaya @xtiandela @H0R0M0R1 pic.twitter.com/r6uRdckhCb People going to #MugabeMustFall rally in Highfields #Zimbabwe pic.twitter.com/uqltZDt6Gu #Zimbabwe pic.twitter.com/ogb9uHBd8x Legacy officially gone #zimbabwe pic.twitter.com/ijYs0GgDLh A 5/6: Robert Mugabe road sign in trouble @kwirirayi @Mavhure @lashiasn @RMajongwe @matigary @Wamagaisa @GomoDubi @mayor_justice @TembaMliswa @Mamoxn @ZimMediaReview pic.twitter.com/1067SkVfeS Today's protest in Bulawayo, #Zimbabwe.

(Fin24 correspondent Crecey Kuyedzwa)   #AntiMugabeRally 'an opportunity for a fresh start', says Zim pastor Mawarire  Thousands of Zimbabweans are expected to demand President Robert Mugabe'sresignation on Saturday at a march in the capital, Harare.  The march to State House is backed by the army, which seized power on Wednesday.  Demonstration is also expected to take place at City Hall in Bulawayo, the second city.  Zimbabwe has been in political turmoil since the early hours of Wednesday, when the country's armed forces seized power and placed Mugabe - who leads the Zanu-PF party, under house arrest.  March organiser Chris Mutsvangwa, who leads the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association, said the rare show of public defiance against the president is not a Zanu-PF affair, but "a show of people's force" against Mugabe's 37-year rule.  William Gerald Lumumba Mutumanje - popularly known as Acie Lumumba, an activist who was expelled as the Zanu-PF youth leader, said the demonstration was a "send-off" for Mugabe as he encouraged people to march to State House.   #Zimbabwe pic.twitter.com/sbliRQsqWS People are arriving in buses, on trucks and fully packed cars.

In a colourful gathering that even days ago would have drawn an immediate police crackdown, Zimbabweans giddy with joy raced through intersections, raising their arms in triumph. Young men shouted, laughed and embraced.  Some had posters with an image of the military commander who swept in earlier this week and put Mugabe under house arrest, with the slogan: "Go, go, our general!!!" Marchers handed flags to soldiers, who accepted and waved.  "It's like Christmas," said one marcher, Fred Mubay, who said Zimbabweans have been suffering for a long time.  The 93-year-old Mugabe, the world's oldest head of state, is said to be asking for more time amid negotiations that seek his exit with a veneer of dignity.   #Zimbabwe never looked so colourful!!!

Unnamed sources said MDC-T Mabvuku-Tafara lawmaker James Maridadi had notified the speaker of parliament of his intention to move for a motion to impeach Mugabe.   #SolidarityMarch 10 #mugabe #zimbabwe #harare #twimbos #thisflag #263chat @un @SADC_News @_AfricanUnion @SAPresident pic.twitter.com/PEpWRwHXeK #Zimbabwe pic.twitter.com/ECcnFSk4U2 Protesters making their way through the streets for the anti-Mugabe rally #Zimbabwe ???? pic.twitter.com/ujtG9hGBwp @harumutasa look at the joy on pple faces, history been made #Zimbabwe #NewZimbabwe pic.twitter.com/BEVAEv6Qs9 History happening in Harare this morning! #Zimbabwe? pic.twitter.com/KGm0UkVefT The people of Bulawayo  have spoken too..the army opened the door...#Zimbabwe #Mugabe #AntiMugabeMarches pic.twitter.com/l0642i0IRd #zimbabwe #Zimbabwe #Mugabe #CNN @BBCAfrica  things are starting to excite in Bulawayo pic.twitter.com/j0jflakrte #Zimbabwe bathong ???????? pic.twitter.com/cgPi5PWje6 #AriseZimbabweArise  "@k_mangwende: When my kids ask where were dad, I can say I was there. #Zimbabwe #freshstart pic.twitter.com/6B0QDTNIYR" #zimmarch in pics as all roads lead to Zim Grounds#263chat pic.twitter.com/992IfL4HZC Mugabe 'must go today, not any other day', protesters chant at #Anti-MugabeRally Zimbabweans have on Saturday started gathering at the Highfields sports ground in Harare, calling for President Robert Mugabe to step down.  Some called it a historic day, hoping for change after Mugabe's nearly four decades as president. Some had the national flag draped around their shoulders.  As a group of soldiers arrived at the stadium, they were met with cheers and song.  "He must go today, not tomorrow. He must go today and not any other day," said one man. 'Mugabe no

down as he no longer has any regional support to cling on to power, says a
report.

also "presented an opportunity to put Zimbabwe to a path of peace and
prosperity".
