	     Johannesburg – Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Minister Des van Rooyen "voluntarily" left a voting station in Metsimaholo, Free State, on Wednesday morning after he was blocked by EFF supporters, his spokesperson told News24. Around 10 EFF supporters apparently refused the minister entry to a polling station in a church and asked that he leave the area.  Van Rooyen was visiting the area in his capacity as the chairperson of the inter-ministerial committee on elections. The Metsimaholo municipality is caught in a highly contested by-election after an EFF, DA and local Metsimaholo Community Association (MCA) coalition fell apart.  According to Cogta spokesperson Legadima Leso, the EFF supporters erected a large tent at the entrance of the polling station, blocking the minister's access to the polling station.The ministry, however, said it did not intend laying a complaint with the Electoral Commission of South Africa."When the minister arrived for his oversight visit, the supporters asked that he leave the area and the minister said: 'You know what, in the interest of free and fair elections let me leave'," Leso said.    "They have chased away Gupta Appointee Des Van Rooyen from a voting station," @MoLesetja tweeted.  "U got elections on one side, Van Rooyen being chased on the other. Questionable nominations by PGC (Provincial General Council)… Maigot!"   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
