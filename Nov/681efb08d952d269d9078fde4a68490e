	     Mogadishu - A US military investigation of an August raid in Somalia is contradicting Somali officials' accusations that several civilians, including children, were killed. The US-supported raid by Somali forces on August 25 in Bariire village caused an uproar, with bodies laid out in the capital, Mogadishu, for display. Somalia's army chief said civilians were killed. The US Africa Command statement says a "thorough assessment" of the raid by US Special Operations Command Africa shows "the only casualties were those of armed enemy combatants." There was no immediate response from Somali officials. The Trump administration this year approved expanded military operations against the Somalia-based extremist group al-Shabaab. A separate statement on Wednesday by the US Africa Command says there are currently more than 500 US military personnel in the Horn of Africa nation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
