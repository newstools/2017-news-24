	     Harare - Zimbabwe's new president is vowing that "democratic" elections will be held next year as scheduled, and he declares that the country is renewing itself after 37 years of Robert Mugabe. President Emmerson Mnangagwa is urging Zimbabwe to move beyond the poisoned politics of the recent past. "We dare not squander this moment". He also promises to reimburse the farmers whose land was seized under Mugabe, leading to international condemnation. But he says those actions cannot be reversed. President Emmerson Mnangagwa says he is "deeply humbled" to take power after an extraordinary series of events that began with Mugabe firing him early this month as vice president. Mugabe resigned on Tuesday under immense pressure from the military, the ruling party and the people amid fears his wife was trying to take power.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
