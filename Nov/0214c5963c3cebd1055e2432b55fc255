	       Harare - Zimbabwe's state-run newspaper has published what it calls new photos of President Robert Mugabe meeting with army commander Constantino Chiwenga as talks continue on a resolution to the political turmoil and the likely end to Mugabe's decades-long rule. The photos published by the Zimbabwe Herald show Mugabe and the army commander meeting at the state house. Chiwenga on Monday threatened to "step in" to calm tensions after Mugabe last week fired deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa, who enjoys military support. Mugabe had been under house arrest since the military moved in overnight on Tuesday.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
