	     Gauteng – National Treasury's deputy head of budget, Michael Sachs, has accepted an offer to join the Gauteng provincial government, less than a week after Treasury confirmed that he had resigned.  Sachs will join the Office of the Premier as the deputy director general responsible for performance monitoring and evaluation. Gauteng Premier David Makhura has requested Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba to facilitate the lateral transfer of Sachs to the Gauteng provincial government.  "I would like to use the skills of Michael Sachs to immediately help to stabilise the finances of the Gauteng Department of Health, which poses a major risk at the moment," said Makhura. "He will thereafter focus on monitoring and fast-tracking spending on infrastructure budgets of the Gauteng departments and municipalities."
