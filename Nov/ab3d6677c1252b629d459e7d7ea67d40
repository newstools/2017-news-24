The group of about 16 traditional Zulu dancers who are scheduled to compete in the competition's finale on Sunday, November 12, were robbed of their belongings and documents in Inanda, e.tv publicist Michael Pocock told News24. The belongings included a laptop and cellphone. "No members of the group were hurt," said Pocock. The group from Ntuzuma - a township north of Durban - was travelling to Lanseria airport in Johannesburg to prepare for the finale set to take place at Soweto Theatre at 18:00 on Sunday when they were robbed, Pocock said. A source at the airport said the group missed their morning flight and they had to be rebooked on a 13:00 flight. "Despite this unfortunate event, Amazebra's participation in the SA's Got Talent will go ahead and e.tv and Rapid Blue, the production company of SA's Got Talent, will provide full support for the group of contestants," said Pocock. AmaZebra will compete with Nan Hua Dancers, Art of Dance, acapella groups Just 6 and Anecnote and Opera singer Siphokazi for the prize money of R500 000.
