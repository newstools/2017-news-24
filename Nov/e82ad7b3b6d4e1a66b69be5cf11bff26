	     Phoenix - US police say a 94-year-old Phoenix woman freed herself from the boot of her car hours after she was abducted from her condominium by a man who put her in the vehicle, drove away and parked it at a shopping mall. Police say the woman's ordeal began when the man in his 30s forced his way into the woman's home in the suburb of Scottsdale. The man tied the woman up, put her in the boot of her four-door sedan and drove it a short distance to the Scottsdale Fashion Square mall, said police spokesperson Ben Hoster. The unidentified woman spent about seven hours in the trunk until she managed to get out. A passer-by saw her and called 911. The woman was taken to hospital.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
