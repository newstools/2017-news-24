The National Sea Rescue Instituteâ€™s Strandfontein duty crew were alerted on Sunday at noon to help their neighbouring colleagues of the Strandfontein Lifesaving Club. A lifeguard had launched into the surf to help a 30-year-old man caught in strong rip currents. The lifeguard was securing the man, preventing him from drowning, 200m into the sea off Strandfontein beach but the currents were preventing him from bringing the man back to the beach. NSRI Strandfontein launched the NSRI wave rider Film Industry Rescuer One and reached the lifeguard and the man. All the while he was being kept afloat by the lifeguard. They were both brought safely to the beach on the rescue sled. Once safely on the beach the two people needed no further help. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
