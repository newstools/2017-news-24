	     Johannesburg - A video has emerged of a black man being assaulted by a group of white men outside a Mugg & Bean restaurant at Tambotie Mall in Randfontein.  The incident allegedly took place on Saturday afternoon, according to police reports. In the video a large group of men can be seen kicking a man who’s lying on the ground, but it’s not clear what started the altercation.  The assault goes on for some time while he’s dragged from one spot to another by the group of men as they continue to kick him.  A woman can be heard in the background screaming, “what the hell” and asking what’s going on in Sesotho but bystanders do not come to the aid of the man being beaten.  Mugg & Bean marketing executive, Jacquie Schultz, released a statement saying none of their customers or staff were involved in the altercation.  “The footage appears to show passersby involved in a physical altercation outside the restaurant. Mugg & Bean management did not witness the incident and the restaurant’s staff and customers were not involved."   Communications officer at the Randfontein police station, captain Appel Ernst confirmed to DRUM that a case of assault was reported. “It was alleged that suspects assaulted a victim at Tambotie Mall on Saturday and two suspects aged 20 and 25 were arrested,” said Ernst.  The Station Commander, Brigadier Manamela also added, “Our communities must also be careful not to make racial connotations with regard to crime." "Crime affects everyone. Let us take hands to eradicate crime, without looking at colour."   Social media users were enraged by the video and believe that the violence was racially charged.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
