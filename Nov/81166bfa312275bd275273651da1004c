	        Send us your pictures   ·  Send us your stories Baby Mienke, who suffered brain damage after choking on milk at her daycare centre, is back home and learning to drink on her own again. The nine-month-old choked on milk at her daycare centre in Mbombela (Nelspruit) in August. By the time she arrived at Mediclinic Nelspruit she was blue in the face. It's not clear how long Mienke stopped breathing – but she's clearly a fighter. People from all over South Africa have been praying for the little girl and her family. Doctors warned her family that she would be severely disabled because of her brain damage, but her family still haven’t lost hope. She started receiving treatment at a rehabilitation centre in Benoni, east of Johannesburg, last week. Her mother, Verna Mulder (26), shared a video with YOU on Friday. Verna says that Mienke is still being fed through a feeding tube in her stomach. “Getting her to drink out of a cup is to try and get her used to the feeling of having milk in her mouth again. It’s just a few drops,” she says. Mienke’s father, Ryno, told YOU that his little girl is making progress. “If you look at where she was and where she is now . . . she’s gotten so much better,” he says.
