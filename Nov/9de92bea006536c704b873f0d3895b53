	     Cape Town – Less than a week after being accused of accepting a financial contribution from a self-confessed tobacco smuggler, ANC presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said corruption eroded trust between the government and citizens.  The former chairperson of the African Union on Friday addressed the International Union of Socialist Youth in Centurion, saying that the question of corruption was a massive problem.  "Firstly, it takes away resources from people who need it," she said.  "Secondly, corruption erodes trust between government and citizens and must be dealt with. All types of corruption, even the one rife in the private sector," she added. READ: 'I’m not corrupt and I don’t loot' – Dlamini-Zuma Her address was tweeted on her official Twitter account.

Dlamini-Zuma added that access to finance for young people was a big problem, saying that financial institutions need to understand society.  "Not everyone has collateral," she said.  On the campaign trail for the ANC presidency, Dlamini-Zuma has consistently preached for radical economic transformation.
