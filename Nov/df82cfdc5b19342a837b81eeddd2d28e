	     Harare – Zimbabwe's presidential hopeful Nkosana Moyo has promised to reduce the country’s cabinet ministers to 16 if elected in the forthcoming presidential elections, says a report.  According to New Zimbabwe.com, Moyo said this while speaking to young people in Harare.  The Alliance for People's Agenda (APA) candidate said that the current number of cabinet ministers of at least 70 was a waste of tax payers' money.  Moyo vowed that should he become president, his government would roughly be made up of not more than 20 people.  "I would shrink the size of government. I would shrink it to a point where the cabinet is not bigger than 20 people. In fact, we have done the numbers, I came up with 16. I am saying 20 because I am giving myself a bit of headroom in case I have ignored certain things," he was reported as saying.  Moyo had earlier said that both President Robert Mugabe and his long-time challenger Morgan Tsvangirai were unfit to contest the 2018 presidential elections. He said that Mugabe and Tsvangirai should by now have exited the political scene due to their health problems.   "Realistically, both President Mugabe and president Tsvangirai are unwell. These are things that people are going to consider as well as look into. If this was in the US, just on the basis of health alone, they would not qualify to run," Moyo was quoted as saying.     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
