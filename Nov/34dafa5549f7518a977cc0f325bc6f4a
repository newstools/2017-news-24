Skorpem said he is still in shock about the incident, but is thankful to God he is alive, this after last month’s well-supported #BlackMonday campaign against farm attacks. Skorpem told Fever he heard his dog barking at about 10.50pm and went to investigate. “As I untied the dog, I was approached by a man wielding a bush knife, who then attacked me with it.” Skoperm fought the attacker, who then abandoned the fight and ran away, disappearing into the darkness. Skoperm was injured on his head, arm and hand. He said the love and support he has received from the community, police, security companies and farmers in the area after the incident is amazing. Paddock Farmers’ Association chairman Bruce Pepworth said it is fortunate that Skorpem was not killed. He said farmers in the area had a good relationship with the community and they believe the suspect was just an individual trying his luck. “Even the police work very closely with our security companies,” said Pepworth. According to the SAPS spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane a case of assault with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm was opened and is under investigation. No arrests have been made yet. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
