	     Conviction was finalised in Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court last Wednesday in the murder case involving former police officer Thobelani Khuzwayo. Khuzwayo was found guilty of murdering Kavlin Naidoo­ from Northdale in a road rage incident which occurred three years ago. He is due for sentencing on November 29. Naidoo was shot in front of his brother and fiancée on the corner of Retief and Jabu Ndlovu streets in November 2014.  In a lengthy judgment Magistrate Muntukayise Khumalo said Khuzwayo failed to handle the road rage incident as a police officer and a citizen. “You failed to report the matter to the police or your superior. I do not understand why you discharged a firearm without being certain your life was in danger.” Khumalo said nothing explains Khuzwayo’s conduct other than that he was infuriated by the incident. Recapping on state witness evidence­, Khumalo dismissed Khuzwayo’s claims that Naidoo and his brother were trying to hijack him and that he [Naidoo] died because of hospital negligence.  He described Khuzwayo as a “dishonest” witness who failed to corroborate his version of events at the trial.  “There is no evidence that the deceased died due to hospital negligence, and there is no reason to doubt the state witnesses who said they saw Khuzwayo pointing a gun and shooting Naidoo.” Khuzwayo, who was arrested on November 5, 2014 after being confronted by his superior about his firearm, maintained his innocence throughout the trial­. The court also heard that the cartridge found at the scene came from Khuzwayo’s firearm. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
