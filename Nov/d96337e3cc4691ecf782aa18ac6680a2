Zimbabwe's former president Robert Mugabe, 93, was reportedly offered a $10
million lump sum payment, full monthly salary, medial cover, security as well
as protection of his private properties, as part of a deal that led to his
resignation.  This came
as reports indicated this week that the nonagenarian was also granted immunity
from prosecution after his resignation as the leader of Zimbabwe on Tuesday.  According
to The Independent, negotiators managed to
strike a deal with the country’s army generals to enable Mugabe not to go into
exile but rather enjoy his retirement in Zimbabwe with all his benefits.
 "Government
will give him $5 million lump-sum and then the remainder to be paid out in
instalments," the report quoted a source as saying. "Mugabe
will also enjoy full medical cover as well as his full monthly salary. In the
event of his death, his wife will be given half salary per month." Zimbabweans
witnessed the inauguration of their new president Emmerson Mnanagagwa on
Friday after Mugabe's 37 years in power. The
75-year-old's first speech as leader reached out to the nation at large,
pledging "democratic" elections next year. Mnangagwa also made friendly gestures
toward the international community as he seeks to revive a collapsed economy
after years of sanctions and corruption. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
