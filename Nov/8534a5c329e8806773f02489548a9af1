Nadim Nyker Between the matric final examinations and going to work, the National Taxi Alliance strike has left thousands without transport.  According to News24, the City of Tshwane has informed its customers about the disruption of services on Wednesday, with taxi operators driving to the offices of the minister of transport in Tshwane to voice their concerns. Here's what Twitter had to say about the strike that's left thousands stranded.  Twitter users have pushed for taxi drivers to still let matriculants write their final exams.  There’s a large police presence in Tshwane as taxi drivers are using trucks to block roads in and out of the townships.  Taxis are blocking highways throughout Gauteng.  People who were left stranded were forced to walk back home Wednesday morning.  Even if commuters are able to find alternative means of transport, concerned Twitter users say blocked roads will stop them from getting to work anyway.
