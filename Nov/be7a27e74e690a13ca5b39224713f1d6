	     Ouagadougou - French President Emmanuel Macron says he is confident that French judicial authorities will extradite the brother of Burkina Faso's former leader in an investigation of the killing of a journalist. Francois Compaore, younger brother of former President Blaise Compaore, was arrested in France late last month. During a visit to Burkina Faso, Macron says authorities are examining the country's request for his extradition. He says Francois Compaore is not detained but is banned from traveling. Journalist Norbert Zongo was killed along with three others in 1998. He had been investigating the death of Francois Compaore's chauffeur. Zongo's case was abandoned in 2006 but the transition government reopened it after Blaise Compaore stepped down in October 2014.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
