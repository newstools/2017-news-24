	     THE Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma Local Municipality is to celebrate Transport Month a bit late, but will educate locals about road safety in Bulwer on November 9.  Stakeholders, including the taxi industry, disaster management and traffic officers will do presentations and religious groups will pray at the event.  Mayor Ngeneleni Mngcwabe said many people have been killed in road accidents already and the municipality wants to educate drivers about the rules of the road. “I want stakeholders to work together in fighting road accidents especially on the R617. Municipal traffic officers have done a tremendous job of apprehending drivers who fail to adhere to the rules of the roads,” said Ncwabe. — Supplied. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
