	     Pretoria - Angry community members clashed with police after it emerged that two farmers accused of assaulting, tying up and shooting at a 9-year-old girl had been released on bail on appeal to the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria. Chaos broke out at the Bronkhorstspruit Magistrate's Court on Tuesday after dozens of rubber bullets were fired at protesters who were at the court appearance of Johannes Potgieter, 33, and Hendricks Dumas, 48. Potgieter and Dumas have been accused of tying the 9-year-old girl to a tree on their farm, beating and shooting at her before letting her go. Her mother and brother were also shot. The incident took place on September 9 2017, they were both arrested a day later. At the court appearance, two women who were shot with rubber bullets multiple times have been taken to hospital and journalists have been threatened by the crowd. Police launched stun grenades and fired dozens of rubber bullets dispersing the crowd after they threw bottles at the NPA representative who was about to address them outside court. It is believed the release of the duo on bail who are charged with kidnapping, attempted murder, pointing of a firearm and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, angered the protesters. Several protesters were arrested and other were injured during the chaos. Some sought refuge behind cars and on the ledges of nearby houses and buildings. This is a developing story.
