	     The ANC is fighting to prevent a second dysfunctional provincial executive committee after disgruntled Eastern Cape members took the party to the East London High Court in a bid to declare the conference null and void. Despite the party’s national executive intervention, the aggrieved parties have asked for the court’s intervention, even before exhausting internal organisational processes regarding the violent elective provincial conference that allegedly compromised its integrity.  ANC national spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said the party had already instructed its lawyers to defend the organisation on the matter because it had been cited as the first respondent. Oscar Mabuyane, who is the second respondent in the matter, was elected as provincial chairman during the conference, defeating former chairman Phumulo Masualle, who abandoned the conference when violence broke out. Party members were urged to wait for the internal process to be completed before going to court, but they ignored the plea.  It was expected that the national executive committee (NEC) would resolve the matter this weekend.  After meeting with the province’s structures, including branches and regions, the ANC’s national working committee referred the matter of the legitimacy of the ANC’s eighth provincial conference – where delegates threw chairs at each other, resulting in some injuries – to the NEC for a final decision.  The NEC was scheduled to meet today and rule on the legitimacy of the meeting.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
