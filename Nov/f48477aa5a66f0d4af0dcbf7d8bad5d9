	     London - Robert Mugabe has "lost the
support of the people and of his party", Britain said Monday after the
Zimbabwean president insisted he still holds power despite a military takeover
and demands to quit. "As last night's events showed, we don't yet know how
developments in Zimbabwe are going to play out," Prime Minister Theresa
May's official spokesperson said. "But what does appear clear is that Mugabe has lost the
support of the people and of his party. "We would say that while the situation remains uncertain,
we would appeal for everyone to refrain from violence. We hope to see a
peaceful and swift resolution to the situation." In a televised address late on Sunday, Mugabe defied expectations
he would quit, pitching the country into a second week of political crisis. The speech provoked anger and disbelief among many Zimbabweans,
fuelling concerns that the 93-year-old veteran leader could face a violent
backlash. Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe since independence from British rule
in 1980. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
