	     Harare – Zimbabwe's president Robert Mugabe has agreed to the terms of
his resignation and a letter has been drafted, a CNN report says, citing
sources with direct knowledge of negotiations.  The report said that the army generals had agreed into many of Mugabe's
demands. Under the agreed deal, Mugabe and his wife will be granted full immunity
and he would keep his private properties. For the resignation to formally take place,
however, a letter must first be sent to the speaker of Parliament, the source
reportedly said.  Mugabe stunned many on Sunday after he
stressed that he was still in power during a much-anticipated TV address.  "The
(ruling Zanu-PF) party congress is due in a few weeks and I will preside over
its processes," Mugabe said, pitching the country into further
uncertainty. Many Zimbabweans expected Mugabe to
resign after the army seized power last week. But Mugabe delivered his speech
alongside the uniformed generals who were behind the military intervention. In his address, Mugabe made no
reference to the clamour for him to resign. Instead he paid tribute to three
pillars of power in Zimbabwe - the military, the ruling party and the war
veterans movement - and urged national solidarity. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
