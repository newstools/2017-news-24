	     Durban – A firefighter was assaulted and two firehoses were
vandalised as fire crews battled a blaze at the Foreman Road informal settlement
in Durban in the early hours on Sunday morning. Two children were injured and over a thousand people
displaced, the area's Community Policing Forum (CPF) said on Sunday. "Initially when the fire was being put out, someone hit
one of the firemen with a crowbar and knocked him out," said Satish
Dhupelia, a member of the Sydenham CPF as well as the outreach officer of the
Gandhi Development Trust.  "At 02.45 a fire started… The fire was only contained
by 04.30 because of a few hooligans who assaulted a fireman and cut some
hoses," added Dhupelia. At first, the firemen were able to contain the fire as it
was confined to a small area. However, "while the firemen were attacking the fire,
they were being attacked by drunken, idiotic people". After the one fireman was knocked out, the group had to
retreat and wait for public order policing to arrive. This caused a delay, but as the firefighters tackled the
blaze again with police protection, vandals then cut their hosepipes twice,
Dhupelia said. By the time the fire was extinguished, two children needed to
be hospitalised. The fire destroyed more than 100 shacks and led to the
displacement of approximately 1 000 people. No arrests were made as the culprits were able to escape in
the dark, Dhupelia said.   KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
