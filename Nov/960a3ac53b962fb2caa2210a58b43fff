Motorists can expect a ten-minute delay between Union Avenue (M3) and Canterbury Drive in Newlands as the City of Cape Town’s transport and urban development authority has started with resurfacing work. The construction along a 2.5km stretch of Rhodes Avenue started on Monday last week.  A City statement says there will be a stop-and-go from 09:00 to 15:30 from Monday to Saturday and there will be no work on Sundays.  The construction will be paused during the festive holidays, from 15 December to 8 January. The overall work should be completed in April next year.  Eddie Andrews, Mayco member (South), says: “Given the number of vehicles that use this stretch of road, the roadwork will unfortunately come with a level of inconvenience and frustration but I appeal to residents to be patient as they stand to benefit when the project is completed. We have planned ahead to ensure that work is completed as quickly as possible and we thank residents for their understanding.” According to the statement, counts show that about 12 000 vehicles drive on this road daily in both directions during the week and it is used by local commuters and commuters from other southern suburbs areas, such as Hout Bay. The road is also the main access to Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
