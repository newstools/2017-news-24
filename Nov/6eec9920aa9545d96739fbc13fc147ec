	     A video has emerged online of an alleged hijacking gone wrong – for the hijackers, that is. The short clip was posted by a Facebook page called Intelligence Bureau and has since been viewed over 211 000 times. The incident, believed to be an attempted hijacking, reportedly took place in Florida in Johannesburg. In the video, the driver of a white BMW is trying to execute a three-point turn and get away – but is failing dismally. People can be heard screaming: “Stop him, stop him”, before other community members come into frame and stand in front of the car. Another dashes to the driver’s-side window carrying a brick. The alleged car thieves then get out of the car and flee. Several people chase them, brandishing bricks. "We have heard about the incident,” an officer from the Florida police station, who wished to remain unnamed, told YOU. “However, a case has not yet been opened since it took place which means we cannot take action."
