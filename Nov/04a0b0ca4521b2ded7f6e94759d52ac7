	     An annual exhibition of African nature and wildlife photography began this week at Cape Town’s Iziko SA museum, featuring work by photographers around the world. The exhibition, coordinated by Nature’s Best Photography Africa and Iziko Museums, features 75 award-winning images taken in Africa.  The prizes included photographic safaris to some of Africa’s richest wildlife regions, valued at more than R1m. The exhibition aims to foster local and international support, as well as an appreciation and desire to protect Africa’s natural resources. Visitors to the museum can also download an app to open an augmented reality experience and stand a chance to win hardcover coffee-table books showcasing this year’s winning images.
