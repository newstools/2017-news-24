	     Harare – Zanu-PF’s Generation 40 (G40) faction has reportedly threatened
to stage a demonstration demanding the firing of former vice president Emmerson
Mnangagwa from the ruling Zanu-PF party. According to NewsDay, the demonstration was set to coincide with
Zanu-PF's politburo meeting in Harare on Wednesday. "The
G40 group will stage a demonstration in Harare to push for the expulsion of
Mnangagwa and his colleagues. The purges maybe at the same scale as we saw
during the expulsion of (former vice-president) Joice Mujuru and her Gamatox
faction (in 2014)," a Zanu PF source was quoted as saying. President Robert Mugabe on Monday fired his deputy as
tensions between Mnangagwa and the veteran leader's wife Grace to succeed him
intensified. Grace declared over the weekend
that Mnangagwa should be gone from both the government and
Zanu-PF before the party's extraordinary congress in December. Mnangagwa was the leading contender to succeed Mugabe, 93, but his abrupt removal appeared to clear the way for
Grace to take over.  NewsDay,
however, quoted Harare provincial commissar Shadreck Mashayamombe as saying
that Wednesday's gathering had nothing to do with "Mnangagwa's issues". Mashayamombe
reportedly said that the gathering was instead meant to show "support for the president". "We
want to thank him (Mugabe) and the First Lady for continuously discharging
their duties diligently in both the party and government. It will have nothing
to do with that one (Mnangagwa) who was fired," Mashayamombe was quoted as
saying.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
