	     Johannesburg - Ekurhuleni regional chairperson and mayor Mzwandile Masina has won
the day in his branch. It has nominated  Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to replace
President Jacob Zuma at the December elective conference.  Sources including those who support Deputy
President Cyril Ramaphosa confirmed the nomination "Ward 51 in Ekurhuleni nominated NDZ
uncontested and the regional chairperson [Masina] was entrusted with a
responsibility to be a delegate," the source said.  Masina's branch has been in the headlines aftermembers accused him
of trying to manipulate the nomination process to favour Dlamini-Zuma.  His endorsement of Dlamini-Zuma is in sharp
contrast to the Gauteng provincial executive committee's position to endorse
Ramaphosa.  In an interview with
News24, Masina said he would resign as Ekurhuleni mayor if Ramaphosa was
elected president and majority of branches in his region nominated him.   Read more here: I will not serve under Ramaphosa - Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina   Some of Dlamini-Zuma's supporters have
