	     SAPS Crime Prevention members and Corporate Communications officer Captain Patrick Ngwane visited ATMs in the Tongaat CBD on Monday, October 31 to address users about safety hints that will prevent them from becoming victims this festive season. “We ask our community to report any crime or suspicious activity to the police immediately.” said Ngwane. Ngwane said the campaign was part of the festive season crime awareness campaign. “ATM users must be alert and conscious of their surroundings when using the ATM.  “They must never give a card or pin number to anyone for any reason,” Ngwane said. He also warned the public about writing their pin numbers on their bank cards. “You must not insert your card until asked to do so by the display screen. Never accept help from strangers when using an ATM.  “Criminals work in teams. One distracts you while the other steals your card or money. “If the card is retained [by the machine] it is advisable to phone the bank toll-free stop-card line immediately and block the card.”  Ngwane said people must report any crime to the SAPS or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.  Captain Henry Kisten warned the public to refrain from carrying large sums of money over the festive season.  “We have received many reports of people being robbed of cash after withdrawing large sums of money.  “People can arrange with their bank to deposit their money directly into their accounts.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
