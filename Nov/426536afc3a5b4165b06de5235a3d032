	     Juba - The UN and the South Sudan government say that 1.25 million people in South Sudan are facing starvation, double the number from the same time last year. Humanitarians and the government warn that this war-torn country could once again plunge into famine in 2018. Humanitarians blame the worsening situation on South Sudan's continuing conflict, which is nearing its fifth year and has killed more than 50 000 people. The war prevents reliable distribution of food aid. As of September, 6 million people — 56% of the population — were experiencing severe hunger with 25 000 South Sudanese in humanitarian catastrophe in Ayod and Greater Baggari counties. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
