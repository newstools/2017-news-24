Derrick Spies, Correspondent Port Elizabeth â€“ A bus transporting children to school collided with a car in Kabega Park, Port Elizabeth, on Wednesday morning. Police spokesperson Captain Johan Rheeder said the Algoa Bus Company driver did not see the car in front of the bus as she turned into a traffic circle on Northumberland Avenue. The bus collided with the Suzuki sedan, which flipped onto its side, with the bus on top of it.  Rheeder said none of the children or the bus driver had been injured, but that the woman in the car had been taken to hospital for treatment. The woman had apparently just dropped her children off at school and was on her way to work when the accident happened.  Rheeder said police had opened a reckless and negligent driving case against the bus driver as standard procedure, and that this would be referred to the deputy director of public prosecutions for a decision on whether to take the case further.      24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
