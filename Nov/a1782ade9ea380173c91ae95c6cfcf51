	     Port Elizabeth – Police are hunting for the killers of four men whose bodies were dumped in the bushes near Coega over the weekend, after they were abducted last week.  Police spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge said three of the four men had since been positively identified by their families.  They are Athenkosi Steven, 21, Nyaniso Maso, 30 and Sive Vangqa, 26. The four were abducted from Steven’s home in Maqubela Street, New Brighton, where Maso and Vangqa, along with a fourth as yet unidentified person, had been visiting at the time. An unknown number of men are believed to have forced the four into a white VW Jetta shortly after midnight on Thursday. Beetge said they were still following up leads on the identity and family of the fourth man. Their decomposed bodies were discovered by two passing herdsmen looking for their cattle in the bushes next to the Grassridge gravel road near Coega.  A post mortem revealed that the men had been strangled, stabbed and had endured blunt force trauma to their heads.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
