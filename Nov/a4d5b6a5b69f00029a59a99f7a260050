	     Polokwane – Fifteen suspected trafficking victims, aged between 16 and 30, have been rescued, with three arrests made, the Hawks said on Wednesday. Limpopo Hawks spokesperson Captain Matimba Maluleke said: "We have rescued 15 Ethiopians between the ages of 16 and 30, who were allegedly held captive at a certain house in Polokwane last night [Tuesday]." Three suspects in their early thirties, also believed to be from Ethiopia, were found in the house. They were arrested and are expected to appear in court soon.  Maluleke said the rescued group was taken to a place of safety while their investigation continued. In January this year, the Hawks rescued four people who were allegedly trafficked from Zimbabwe.  A man identified as Raymond Sithole from Chebeng Village, just outside Seshego, was arrested and later released on bail.  He is set to appear in court on November 30, 2017. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
