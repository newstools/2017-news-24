                 #JasonRohde Mihalik: if the police are investigating suicide/murder, should you go for both sides or just incriminating evidence? #Rohde trial on tea adjournment @TeamNews24 #Rohde trial public gallery is almost empty. Rohde watching data extraction testimony from the dock, water in front of him @TeamNews24 Quite technical here in #Rohde trial - talking about phone and SIM card's ''DNA" via sim card no, and IMEA no @TeamNews24 Quite technical here in #Rohde trial - talking about phone and SIM card's ''DNA" via sim card no, and IMEA no @TeamNews24 Defence Mihalik asks data extraction expert whether he could tell if Susan #Rohde had googled suicide on her phone. Didn't check @TeamNews24 #JasonRohde 05:50 Jolene- Susan. 07:02 Jolene-Susan. 07:02 Susan-Jolene. 07:06 Susan-Jolene. This contradicts Khan's time of death (05:50) Adv Peter Mihalik going to cross examine Engelbrecht over comms between Jolene and Jason #Rohde @TeamNews24 No sim card in Jason #Rohde's phone, nor Jolene's when they were handed over to police. Susan's had a sim card @TeamNews24 Whatsapp msgs between Susan #Rohde and Jolene Alterskye also found. The Mmgs found on Susan's phone deleted from Jolene's phone. @TeamNews24 On 8 August 2016, whatsapp chats  between Alterskye and Jason #Rohde were deleted from Jason's phone. @TeamNews24 W/O says so much info, so  was asked to isolate comms between Jason #Rohde, Susan Rohde and Jolene Alterskye. @TeamNews24 W/O used different software, again with defence rep, and got Susan #Rohde's WhatsApp info. @TeamNews24 Extraction was done in presence of a defence rep. He tried Susan #Rohde's phone again next day with defence rep. @TeamNews24 W/O Engelbrecht  was asked to investigate 2 phones. He is explaining the initial processes: checking bag sealed, etc. @TeamNews24 #Rohde W/O Engelbrecht detailing credentials on extracting + analysing data from ''dumb phones'' like old Nokias and smartphones @TeamNews24 #Rohde #JasonRohde Engelbrecht says his training is internationally recognised.

Testimony re cellphone extractions of whatsapp messages between Jason & Susan & Jolene Alterskye ICYMI: Rohde pathologist still off sick, trial postponed The Western Cape High Court trial of property mogul Jason Rohde was postponed on Monday because the Stateâ€™s forensic pathologist, who was supposed to be cross-examined, was too ill to testify. Last Monday, the trial was postponed for a week because the pathologist, Dr Akmal Coetzee-Khan, was ill and could not attend court. However, when the case resumed on Monday, it emerged that Coetzee-Khan was still ill. Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe confirmed that she had received a medical certificate and that Coetzee-Khan would only be fit to resume cross-examination on November 20. ICYMI:  #Rohde case stands down to Wed for further witnesses. Pathologist still unwell. Will organise other witnesses in the meantime @TeamNews24
