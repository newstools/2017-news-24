	     Warri - A Nigerian militant group has announced an end to its cease-fire with the Nigerian government, raising the prospects of renewed attacks on oil installations in the Niger Delta. The announcement on Friday by the Niger Delta Avengers threatens the African nation's fragile economic growth. In a statement posted on their website, the militants accused Nigeria's presidency of being insincere in its peace talks and promises. The group had declared a cease-fire back in August 2016. Attacks on oil installations in 2016 cut Nigeria's oil production from a peak of 2.2 million barrels per day to about 1.2 million, sending the country's economy into recession. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
