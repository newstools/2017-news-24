	     Durban – The battered body of a woman was found in dense bush in Ulundi, northern KwaZulu-Natal, on Thursday morning, police said. Captain Nqobile Gwala said the body of 30-year-old Nokukhanya Mahlaba was recovered after a suspect believed to be her boyfriend pointed its location out. The 42-year-old suspect allegedly assaulted her to death on Tuesday "before dumping the body in the bush". He is expected to appear in the Mahlabathini Magistrate's Court soon.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
