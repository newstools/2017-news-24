	     Harare – Two Zimbabwean men have reportedly been charged with insulting President Robert Mugabe, 93, after they allegedly described the nonagenarian as "a dog". According to New Zimbabwe.com, the two, Allan Chinewaita, 40, and Casper Tambara, 39, of Nyamahumba primary school in Nyanga were this week charged with undermining the authority of the president under Section 33(2)(a) of the Criminal Law Codefication and Reform Act (Code). Chinewaita was alleged to have said: "I will not vote Zanu-PF and President Robert Mugabe is like a dog." Chinewaita said this in Shona. Tambara was also facing the same charge.  A report by NewsDay said that Mugabe's government had increased its clampdown on freedom of expression ahead of general elections in 2018. "As he struggles to hold down his position as the country's leader and entrench his long rule, Mugabe's administration has turned to harassing political opponents, including through crafting a law that criminalises making derogatory comments about him," the report said. Dozens of Zimbabweans have fallen foul of the law, it said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
