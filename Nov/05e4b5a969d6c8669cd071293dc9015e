                 The Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department says it is investigating an allegation that a Lensaia man was stabbed by striking taxi drivers on the N1 Highway while JMPD officers looked on. "JMPD is investigating the allegation internally and a team from JMPD will be visiting the victim at his home", spokesperson Wayne Minnaar told News24. UPDATE: Striking taxi members affiliated to 
the National Taxi Association (NTA) are demanding a subsidy from the 
government and they also want the Aarto bill to be scrapped. The protesters have called for Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi to be fired. Police
 monitored the strike that ended at the Union Buildings after Mandla 
Feni, a director in the Office of the Presidency, accepted a memorandum 
from NTA officials. A list of grievances was also handed over to the transport department earlier in the day. How about concerns/reports about the #TaxiStrike focus at least as much on the legitimate grievances of taximen, as the inconvenience to others? Taximen deserve more respect and support as torchbearers for true #BlackEmpowerment - long before tenderpreneurs! #TaxiStrike never seen this place so empty Bara pic.twitter.com/1TtJs9DAw6 WATCH #TaxiStrike NTA says the president must fire Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi.
