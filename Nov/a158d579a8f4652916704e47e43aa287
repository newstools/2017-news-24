	     Durban – Three men accused of murdering retired Chatsworth principal Gona Pillay will remain in custody while authorities further investigate the circumstances leading to her death. Fredboy Msomi, and cousins Basil and Braveman Underhill, appeared in the Chatsworth Magistrate's Court on Monday. They heard they would remain in custody until their next appearance on December 12, while police continued investigations. Basil Underhill, a 24-year-old Pam Golding Properties intern, was the first to be arrested. He was charged with house robbery, murder and attempted murder. Police arrested his cousin Braveman and Msomi shortly thereafter. Pillay, 63, was stabbed to death last Wednesday evening after four men, posing as potential property buyers, attacked her and her husband Logie, also a former principal. The Pillays had put their house on the market. The pensioner was stabbed several times and died in her Chatsworth home, while her husband, who was also stabbed, is in critical condition in hospital. Chairperson of the Bayview Community Policing Forum Brandon Pillay condemned the attack. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
