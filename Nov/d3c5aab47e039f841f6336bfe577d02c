	     The race to follow President Jacob Zuma as leader of the ruling party is hotting up, as rival factions resort to bitter politicking and – some might say – underhanded tricks. In this environment, ANC presidential hopeful Dr. Zweli Mkhize is pleading for unity; calling for the party to stick together.   Join News24 editor Adriaan Basson and News24 politics editor Mahlatse Mahlase as they speak to the current ANC treasurer-general about his plans for the party… and the country. On Tuesday, 14 November 2017 at 18:00 the event will be live streamed to News24 and News24's YouTube channel.  Mkhize says that he has not been backed by President Jacob Zuma to succeed him as ANC President as claimed by UDM leader Bantu Holomisa. Mkhize says when you stand as a candidate, "you stand as your own with your own history and leadership style. President Zuma has not anointed me."  Watch more in the live stream below:   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
