	     Johannesburg – Two miners have been confirmed dead following a rockfall at a mine near Carletonville on Thursday morning.  AngloGold Ashanti spokesperson Chris Nthite told News24 that a second body had been retrieved from the Mponeng Mine near Carletonville on Johannesburg’s West Rand, following the rockfall which saw eight miners trapped underground.  "We've managed to recover a second employee. Two people are still missing and we're working hard to rescue them," he said.  Nthite said four others had been rescued earlier. He could not comment on their condition but said the teams would not stop until all had been rescued.  He had earlier told News24 that the rescue team was working under "challenging conditions". The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said it was "disturbed and saddened" after they learned of the trapped workers. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
