	     Johannesburg – An inquest docket was opened following the discovery of a partially decomposed body of a male University of the Witwatersrand student in a storeroom on Thursday, police said. Gauteng police spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said no foul play had been suspected at this stage.  "An inquest docket was opened for investigation. Police will wait for the post-mortem results which will determine the cause of death. If it is established that he died due to criminal act, a murder case will be registered," said Dlamini.

The matter is under investigation by the South African Police Services and Campus Protection Services," said Patel.
