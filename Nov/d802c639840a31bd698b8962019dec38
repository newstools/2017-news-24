	     Cape Town – A Port Elizabeth man who raped a 12-year-old girl in a hospital toilet after threatening her with a screwdriver was sentenced to life in prison on Friday, police said. The girl had been playing in Ndukwa Street, Zwide, when Simphiwe Phukane abducted her and took her to the Dora Nginza Hospital on March 11, Captain Andre Beetge said. He raped her in the toilet before being apprehended by about 80 angry Zwide residents, who assaulted him before handing him over to the police. Fears over safety at the hospital were raised at the time. Beetge said Phukane was given a life sentence on Friday for the rape of the girl, a three-year sentence for assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, and one year for the abduction of the child. He was denied leave to appeal. Acting Motherwell cluster commander Brigadier Lindelwa Vellem applauded Warrant Officer Riaan Botha from the Motherwell Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for his work on the case. "The protection of our women and children is one of our key focus areas and criminals that continue to rape and assault our young women should take note that long imprisonment awaits them," she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
