Saphetha told the crowd that the union&rsquo;s leaders were worried that many public sector workers were battling to make ends meet because of low wages. Nehawu wanted better working conditions, a ban on the use of labour brokers, and allowances for workers who operated under difficult conditions.Nehawu&rsquo;s marches in several cities took place as Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan was tabling his Budget, but this did not mean that the union associated itself with calls for his removal.&ldquo;We are not about an individual, but are simply against a system that places profits ahead of humanity,&rdquo; Saphetha said.He decried Treasury&rsquo;s calls for belt-tightening measures and said they were causing more pain for ordinary workers than for elected public representatives and those running parastatals.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
