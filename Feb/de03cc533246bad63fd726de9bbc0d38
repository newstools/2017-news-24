We will be satisfied only when we are sure all schools have indicated each child has received their textbooks and learner material."He said the department had made a request to all schools to call its hotline (0800 265 266) to report any shortfalls.Top-up books replace damaged or missing books.The deadline for school material delivery was February 3.However, Rasila said the department was not sure if it had met its own deadline.The DA said in a statement that on Thursday the department's officials admitted during a Standing Committee on Public Accounts hearing that the department had failed to deliver to all schools in the province.The DA said it was awaiting an urgent resolution of the crisis by the department."It is time that the department accepts responsibility for their reckless lack of planning that is hampering learners' chances to a successful academic year and the DA will continue to expose the department's failure until they prioritise our learners needs," the party's provincial spokesperson on education, Jacques Smalle, said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
