Relations, however, got strained the longer the parolee did not bring in a salary.To counter this, correctional services had approached the SA Social Security Agency to finalise a partnership for social relief for such parolees and ex-offenders.The correctional services delegation included national commissioner Zach Modise and deputy chief commissioner James Smalberger.DA MP James Selfe was shocked at the idea of giving grants to former prisoners.&ldquo;I have a problem in giving somebody a grant because they can&rsquo;t find work because they have been in prison.&rdquo;He suggested employing them in expanded public works programmes to support them and so they could provide a socially useful service.Create balanceANC MP Bongani Bongo was equally disquieted by the idea.&ldquo;It will be the government multiplying its efforts by zero to spend the whole money on trying to rehabilitate an offender, then give them a social grant.&rdquo;Motshekga however said the matter of parolees and ex-convicts struggling to find work needed to be investigated and dealt with if it turned out to be true.He said there were already concerns about young people getting pregnant for social grants.&ldquo;Baby-making becomes a form of employment. The issue of social grants needs to be addressed. We can&rsquo;t continue doing things that way,&rdquo; Motshekga said.Modise conceded it would not be right for ex-offenders to be offered social grants. He was not looking for them to get preferential treatment.&ldquo;We need to create a balance between services we provide to law abiding citizens and those who have offended society.&rdquo;MPs wanted more information on the possibility of expunging criminal records after a certain period, as this would make finding a job easier.&ldquo;There are very few people who are going to employ you when they see you have a criminal record,&rdquo; Selfe said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
