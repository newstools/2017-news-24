She was near Dirkiesdorp, when she came across "several" potholes in the road, her lawyers wrote in a letter to the MEC.&nbsp;She wasn&rsquo;t able to "avoid all the potholes" and her car hit "another/second pothole".Due to the impact, she lost control of the vehicle and it overturned. The car was a write-off.&nbsp;Swart sustained soft tissue injuries to her neck, back and right shoulder. There were also injuries to her forehead, the medico-legal report said.She was taken by ambulance to the Piet Retief Hospital, where the injuries were treated. She was in hospital for a week and had to wear a neck brace when she was discharged.According to the report, Swart hadn&rsquo;t been employed at the time.

She tried once to work a friend&rsquo;s shift at the supermarket, but had to go home after a few hours because of a headache.&nbsp;According to the report, Swart&rsquo;s injuries were hindering her ability to work again. She wouldn't be able to handle heavy objects and wouldn't be able to do "manual labour".&nbsp;Her quality of life, as well as enjoyment of life, would be moderately impaired because of the accident.Swart had claimed just under R1.4m from the MEC.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
