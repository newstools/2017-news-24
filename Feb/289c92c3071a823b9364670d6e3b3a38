Trenches, barbed wire and mine fields flank the Sahrawi side of the wall near El-Mahbes.Cheikh Bechri Mhame, the sector's commanding officer, describes how his men patrol the area in four-wheel-drives, looking out for any movement near the barrier which is two to three metres high.Dressed in military fatigues and armed with automatic rifles, his soldiers are also tasked with cordoning off land peppered with anti-personnel mines.Around a hundred kilometres from there, in one of the refugee camps in the Tindouf area in southwest Algeria, the director of the "Resistance Museum" tells visitors the army was able to adapt to life along the wall.Built between 1980 and 1987, Morocco's "defence wall wasn't efficient in defending the Moroccans," Mohamed Ouleda says."The (Sahrawi) army chose certain spots to carry out incursions, even if at the time there were only 12 000 fighters to face a Moroccan armada."He said Sahrawis captured "511 Moroccan prisoners of war between the wall's construction and the ceasefire", citing Red Crescent documents that AFP was not able to obtain.In his museum, Ouleda shows off "spoils of war... retrieved on the other side of the wall": weapons, armoured vehicles and Moroccan military documents.Polisario chief Ghali says the wall's construction in fact led to a "war of attrition" for the Moroccans, not the Sahrawis."The Moroccans built the wall thinking it was insurmountable," he says."But it became an economic, psychological and moral burden for the Moroccan army instead of a solution.""That's when Morocco started the negotiations that led to the UN peace plan and ceasefire."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
