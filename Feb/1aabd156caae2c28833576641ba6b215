He then took refuge in neighbouring Senegal on January 15, fearing for his safety after Jammeh reversed his acceptance of the election result and sought for weeks to cling to power.The new leader was welcomed home by jubilant crowds in late January after Jammeh left the country under pressure from the 15-nation regional bloc.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
