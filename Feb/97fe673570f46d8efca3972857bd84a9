She was appointed to replace Mahlangu."The PEC agreed with the ANC national media statement, particularly the observation that the utterances and actions of the ANC Youth League Gauteng province were reckless and unbefitting of ANC members," Gauteng ANC secretary Hope Papo said in a statement.The PEC expressed its support for Makhura, despite calls from opposition parties that he step down in the wake of the tragedy.The PEC commended Makhura for the "openness and urgency" with which he was dealing with the ombudsman&rsquo;s report and his commitment to implementing the remedial action, Papo said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
