In a statement, rector Adam Habib said an independent investigation was undertaken after the staff member was accused of harassing three women. EWN reported that the staff member is believed to be a professor and sexually harassed two female lecturers and an office administrator over a two-year period. The women claimed the professor asked them to partake in sexual activities with him and another person in exchange for help with studies, favours at work and a promotion. Habib said the university does not tolerate any form of sexual harassment. "We have revised our policies, instituted several programmes and conscientised the university community to speak out and act against gender-based harm," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
