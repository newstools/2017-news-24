It says that although many Eritreans "have legitimate claims to asylum" they are left with no option but to attempt the often dangerous sea journey.All of the Eritreans reported being held in captivity at some point on their way toward Europe, and more than half had seen fellow asylum-seekers, refugees or migrants die, often from violence.Doctors Without Borders is urging Libya, Sudan and European countries to not forcibly send Eritreans back home.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
