I stopped behind one of the unmarked police cars at a red light on the corners of Sir Lowry and Tennent Streets. And, in an act of protest, I stuck the sticker on the police car,&rdquo; he says.Five men in plain clothing, apparently members of the police&rsquo;s VIP protection unit, jumped out of an SUV behind him.&nbsp;&ldquo;They surrounded me and were yelling at me. They went through my bag and tore up all the remaining stickers. They wouldn&rsquo;t tell me who was in charge. It became clear that they weren&rsquo;t going to arrest me; they were just there to intimidate me. That&rsquo;s when one of them slapped me with his open hand, knocking my glasses off,&rdquo; says Hunter.In a bid to defuse the situation, Hunter says, he admitted to the officers that his actions were wrong, but they continued to shout at him. &ldquo;I told them that this was assault and that they couldn&rsquo;t do this. That&rsquo;s when the officer hit me again.&rdquo;The officers forced him to remove the sticker from the police car before they sped off.&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t able to get a licence plate number. With the reputation of the police protection unit, I think I got off pretty lightly. I stand by my act, because it was a political statement. Whether they should&rsquo;ve arrested me for it is a whole other conversation, but they didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;Hunter opened a case of assault at Cape Town central police station.&ldquo;We will continue our fight against the securitisation of Parliament,&rdquo; says Hunter.National police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said he could not comment as the matter was under investigation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
