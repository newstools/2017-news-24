The lower and upper houses of parliament had been informed, he added.Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo has been deputising for Buhari in his absence.No time-frame for Buhari's return was given, nor any details about the medical tests he had undergone.The health of Nigeria's president is a sensitive issue. In 2010, president Musa Umaru Yar'Adua died in office from a long-standing, but previously undisclosed, kidney complaint. His initial illness and treatment in hospital abroad triggered months of political uncertainty. His deputy, Goodluck Jonathan, took over on Yar'Adua's death.General Sani Abacha, who headed a military regime in the 1990s, also died in office, officially from a heart attack. But rumours persist he met a more lurid end.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
