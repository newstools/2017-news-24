For the DA to get there, their own members must be purified from rot.&rdquo;&nbsp;Burger was responding to a letter which August sent to the City of Cape Town DA caucus, dated February 14. In it he explains his sentencing by the party&rsquo;s disciplinary committee.&nbsp;He admits to making irregular purchases, but says it was done to ensure the party&rsquo;s victory in Cape Town in the August 3 local government elections.&nbsp;&ldquo;In the interests of achieving our goals, the regional executive took a decision to procure T-shirts outside of the normal supply processes,&rdquo; August wrote.&nbsp;August 'not resigning'&nbsp;Ward representative Andrea Crous told News24 the entire ward agreed with Johanneson&rsquo;s stance.Ward 70 includes the neighbourhoods of Welgemoed, Protea Valley, and Tygervalley.August said he had no intention to resign.&nbsp;&ldquo;There is no need for me to resign as I've done nothing wrong,&rdquo; August said.&nbsp;Kempthorne could not be reached for comment.&nbsp;DA federal executive chairperson James Selfe said ex-provincial leader Patricia de Lille was being investigated for her role in the leaking of a confidential document relating to the August-Kempthorne matter to Rapport.The document is a doctored version of an admission of guilt agreement in which August and Kempthorne admit to making misrepresentations in order to buy T-shirts for the DA&rsquo;s campaign, according to&nbsp;Rapport . &nbsp; &nbsp;The DA&rsquo;s federal legal committee approved the agreement and sentence that each forfeit a month&rsquo;s salary in January. On January 30, De Lille quit as the DA's Western Cape leader, but denied her decision had anything to do with August and Kempthorne's admission of guilt. She wanted to focus on her duties as Cape Town mayor, she said. The TygerBurger reported on Tuesday that high-placed party officials said De Lille had received letters notifying her that she needed to defend herself against expulsion from the party. De Lille and Selfe both denied that she was issued with such a letter.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
