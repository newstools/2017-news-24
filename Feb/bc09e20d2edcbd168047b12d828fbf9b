He claimed he only helped them roll her in a sheet and had left her alive in a cement drain.Balithoba claimed that he saw Nyewu and Solontsi kill her in the room. He testified that he was coerced into the events that followed because he was scared of them.&nbsp;Solontsi denied having any part in the murder. Mgushelo did not testify in his defence.All but Mgushelo were linked via DNA to pieces of evidence, but he was found to have actively associated himself with the crimes by remaining silent.They were not found guilty of kidnapping as there was no direct evidence that she was deprived of freedom of movement and kept against her will.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
