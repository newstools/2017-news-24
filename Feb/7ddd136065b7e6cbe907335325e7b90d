The woman who kidnapped her was sentenced to 10 years behind bars. The woman was arrested in February 2015 after the teenager&rsquo;s true identity came to light when the girl's biological sister Cassidy, who is four years younger, told her parents that a girl in matric at her school bore a striking resemblance to her and her parents.DNA tests confirmed the teenager was Zephany.The kidnapper, however, said she got the baby from a woman called Sylvia, who had been giving her fertility treatment in 1997 after she had miscarried.Zephany, now 19, currently lives in Steenberg with the man she thought was her father.- News24 is a part of the 24.com division which falls under Media24. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
