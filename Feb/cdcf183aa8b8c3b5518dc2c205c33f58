She was airlifted to the Bloemfontein Mediclinic, where Dr Jaco Neser treated her. &nbsp; Neser said everything was perfect: her lungs were amazing, the heart fine, her sugar levels normal and her blood count like that of an adult. &nbsp;She had been breathing on her own since birth. Neser said he had treated many premature babies, but never one who did not need life support.&nbsp;'A small miracle'&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this. Everything about her is special. A small miracle. She will develop just like any other premature baby.&rdquo;&nbsp;There was no indication that Lee-Anne sustained permanent damage.Lee-Anne&rsquo;s mother, Antoinette, a housewife from Nababeep in Namaqualand, only found out she was pregnant about two weeks before the infant&rsquo;s birth.&nbsp;Lee-Anne&rsquo;s sudden arrival was a shock for her and her husband John, but also a pleasant surprise, she said.&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t prepared at all. We hadn&rsquo;t even bought her clothes yet.&rdquo;All she wants now, is to hold her baby in her arms.&nbsp;&ldquo;I am sad. She is thousands of kilometres from me, but as soon as I have enough money, I will buy a bus ticket to visit her.&rdquo;Hospital spokesperson Barbara Steenkamp said Lee-Anne was being treated in an incubator in the ICU for premature babies and being tube-fed.&nbsp;&ldquo;She is a special child who has crept into our hearts.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
