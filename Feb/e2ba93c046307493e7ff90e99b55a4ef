It is just an 'Archive' which represent one of the many tricks used by authorities to test &nbsp;our strength, unity and courage .Threatening is a sign of fear. A last ditch attempt at resolving a problem without engaging. We will not waiver," it added.Union representatives were late on Thursday afternoon still locked in a meeting with ministry officials in an attempt to break the impasse.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
