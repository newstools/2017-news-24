They will be marching to the Department of Health and the South African nursing council offices.Denosa wants speedy and full implementation of the National Health Insurance scheme, nurse shortages to be addressed, problems with the payment of nurses and suppliers to be dealt with, and transformation of the South African nursing council. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
