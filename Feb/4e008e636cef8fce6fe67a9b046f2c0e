In fact, it is our contention that Sassa wilfully manufactured an emergency that would leave them with no choice but to extend the current contract.&rdquo;The party is considering legal action against Sassa for failing to comply with the Constitutional Court judgment.READ: Everybody will be paid, I stick by it - Sassa CEO'Reckless, unlawful'NGO Black Sash was &ldquo;gravely concerned&rdquo; with the outcome of Sassa's briefing to Parliament on Wednesday."Sassa&rsquo;s inaction has created this crisis. The agency has placed itself in this position by not adhering to the timelines ordered by the ConCourt," the organisation said in a statement on Thursday.Sassa had placed grant beneficiaries&rsquo; well-being and survival at risk with continued unauthorised, unlawful and fraudulent deductions from their bank accounts. Beneficiaries had inadequate recourse and were becoming indebted.The Black Sash said the committee had failed in its oversight role."The minister has also been significant by her absence at a hearing on this matter for a second time.&ldquo;Ultimately, in the absence of oversight, who will hold Sassa accountable for the creation and delivery of an insourced grant payment system that will finally put an end to unauthorised, unlawful and fraudulent deductions?"It called on civil society to not rest in seeking answers. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
