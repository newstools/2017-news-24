He described the battle as epic.&ldquo;The adrenaline rush one gets when the marlin throws itself out of the water is indescribable ... I had to chase it down while it while spooling my reel. The battle lasted for just over an hour.&rdquo;Symons said he has been fishing since the age of three.&ldquo;It was a passion from a young age and through the years I have been fortunate to experience all facets of fishing from dam fishing to rock and surf, but off-shore deep sea fishing is my greatest passion and enjoyment,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I have landed some beautiful specimens of fish from a kayak and now recently over the last year my PWC jet ski. This beast of a black marlin is my biggest fish up to now weighing in at 65kg [143lbs caught on a 39lb maxima line]. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
