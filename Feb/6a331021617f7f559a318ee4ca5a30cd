This was after Nigerians&nbsp;&nbsp;pushed for clarity on the president&rsquo;s health, with the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) saying: "He [Buhari] should tell them [the public] the true state of his health."&nbsp;Reports indicated that Buhari has been dogged by speculation about whether he was physically fit for office even before he took power in May, 2015.President @MBuhari currently receiving party leaders, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Chief Bisi Akande, in Abuja House, London. pic.twitter.com/NO3ATAAGuyVisit over, President @MBuhari sees off his guests.
