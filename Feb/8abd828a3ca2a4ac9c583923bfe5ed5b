Mulaudzi asked on behalf of Ntlemeza.He said the document and its "baseless accusations", sought to undermine the sovereignty of South Africa, destabilise the justice system and dent the image of the police.'Lions led by donkeys'"Lieutenant General Ntlemeza has asserted, if Paul O&rsquo;Sullivan has any dots to join, he should do so within the ambit of the law and stop feeding the residents of this country with well-orchestrated lies through his partisan media," wrote Mulaudzi.Asked why Ntlemeza took so long to respond to O'Sullivan's report, Mulaudzi said: ''We have been very quiet in terms of not engaging in a public space with Mr Paul O'Sullivan but he has been continually making noise."It came to light on Friday that there was a raid on his house and the Hawks were involved, only to find it was just a lie," said Mulaudzi.On Friday O'Sullivan said a metro police official arrived at his home in Johannesburg, saying she was there about an alleged hit-and-run accident involving his vehicle. He said he had sold the vehicle a year ago. She left, but O'Sullivan said he had a bad feeling about the situation.He left his home and on his way out, saw a convoy of unmarked vehicles heading to his house.O'Sullivan said in response to Sunday's Hawks statement that many dockets had been opened, and then forwarded to the Ipid because the police refused to carry out their constitutional mandate."As a significant tax-payer in this country, I do not appreciate it when unlawfully appointed people, like Ntlemeza, use paid spin-doctors to assassinate my character."He vowed to continue with his investigations, and said he believed it would eventually become clear that he is not what his critics make him out to be. He said the vast majority of police officers were "lions led by donkeys". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
