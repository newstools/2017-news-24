Be warned: it may not make you want to book a holiday up north.Harare &ndash; Zimbabwean First Lady Grace Mugabe has reportedly overhauled her entire security team, as factional wars within the ruling Zanu-PF party "intensified" and "fears of spying for rival factions increased".The sweeping changes occurred in December, with most of the affected personal aides said to have served her for more than 20 years, according to&nbsp;Zimbabwe Independent.Her long-serving and most experienced aides Albert Mujuru and Max Mapfumo were among those who fell by the wayside, the report said.Mapfumo was reportedly "axed for failing to intervene when Robert Mugabe Jr was involved in a scuffle in a night club in Dubai last year".The changes affected close to 10 of her security personnel.An unidentified source in the security cluster said that Grace together with her cohorts in the Generation 40 (G40) faction were under the impression that the security aides were spying for Mnangagwa.Grace's security team was now believed to be led by a senior security aide known as Mubvakure, who was among the aides rejected by Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa in 2015, said the report.The G40 is one of the ruling party factions that supposedly supports Grace. The group is reportedly made up of young prominent Zanu-PF leaders, among them, Higher Education Minister Jonathan Moyo and President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s nephew Patrick Zhuwao.Zhuwawo, however, last year distanced himself from the factional group.The group is bent on keeping Mnangagwa out of the race to succeed the visibly ageing Mugabe. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
