I think it's about 15 to 20 metres so take care."The footage ends after he has drunk the poison. The state-run Chronicle and H-Metro papers reported earlier this week that Nhika later died in Harare's Parirenyatwa hospital. It is not clear who posted the clip online.&nbsp;It has elicited sadness and shock in Zimbabwe, where, as elsewhere in the world, there are worries of copycat attempts.Blog&nbsp;www.3-mob.com&nbsp;said: "It is a worrying trend because it brings so many things we thought were consigned to fiction to life."In the footage, Nhika records himself saying: "I showed you that I loved you. I never did anything... Thank you for showing me that care."Wrote popular Facebook commentator Mike Tashaya on his page: "This AFM pastor though and killing himself on live video. What is going on with people. So tragic."The official Herald last year reported that socio-economic challenges could be driving more Zimbabwean men to commit suicide though there is no evidence that that was the case here.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
