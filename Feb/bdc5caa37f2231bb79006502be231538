He had burns to his face, neck, torso, arms, and hands.&nbsp;Sean&rsquo;s mother, M&eacute;-Lissa, said when she went to school to pick up Sean&rsquo;s brother Devin, the children surrounded the car just to see the teen.&nbsp;&ldquo;They came to greet Sean every day, shaking his hand, hugging him and saying they are glad to see him.&rdquo; &nbsp;DepressedM&eacute;-Lissa said one evening Sean had been depressed and told her it would have been better had he died in the accident. In response, she showed him messages on the &ldquo;Hero Sean&rdquo; Facebook page.&nbsp;&ldquo;He calmed down after I showed him Facebook posts and WhatsApp messages from people who I don&rsquo;t even know.&rdquo;&nbsp;M&eacute;-Lissa said she felt pain every time Sean suffered. &nbsp;&ldquo;Whenever he was in pain, it felt as if someone had stabbed me in the heart with a knife. The agony to say to him he can&rsquo;t give up fighting. You are my anchor. You can&rsquo;t leave me. That was the most difficult of all.&rdquo;&nbsp;Sean is in Grade 10 at Pretoria&rsquo;s Suiderberg School. &nbsp;He has to wear special clothing on his torso for a few hours a day to put pressure on the burn wounds to prevent scars. M&eacute;-Lissa says it doesn&rsquo;t cover his neck. &nbsp;&ldquo;He has to use a gel on his neck for the skin to heal. If they don&rsquo;t get the gel, a plastic surgeon will have to admit him to hospital and give him a cortisone injection in theatre.&rdquo;M&eacute;-Lissa says Sean is still trying to find out what happened during the accident as he can&rsquo;t remember anything.&nbsp; Sean Smith wears a pressure garment to prevent scarring.
