Everybody knows our constitution; it was accepted by the independent electoral commission. We are members of Parliament &ndash; the EFF is an official political party so its positions are official," said Ndlozi.He said the party would not shift from its position on land despite the charges brought against its leadership."Whether it be common law or the Riotous Assemblies Act, it doesn't matter, we can't withdraw our official ideas that have been accepted because we are a political party," he said.Ndlozi said the EFF had the right to campaign and a right to freedom of expression.Malema's pending challenge of the constitutionality of the act is awaiting a date from the Constitutional Court.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
