Support the local meter [taxi industry].&rdquo;The residents felt that foreign nationals were "destroying" the country&rsquo;s image.They accused Zimbabwean churchgoers of messing in public parks and having a hand in attacks at the Groenkloef Nature Reserve."They must be deported; immigration must be involved and deport them we are working backwards as a country."On living conditions, they said residents had to pay a lot of money toward rent, water and electricity, yet people who invaded land and RDP houses did not have to pay anything.Zuma said the media should be careful to label protests as xenophobic and that political leaders should also be cautious with their messages.Crime affected everyone and people were fed up, he said."If there are people who occupy houses and use them for crime, this will make people angry. How do we fight crime?"We must focus on drug lords and deal with them. Those are the gaps we need to close."Zuma urges understandingWhether South African or foreign, criminals should be properly dealt with, Zuma said.He said it would be a sad day when crime and drugs caused chaos in the country.He also urged South Africans to be understanding toward foreign nationals.He questioned how xenophobic South Africans were, saying, if they were, "this country wouldn't have this many immigrants".He said only 5% of immigrants were refugees."The number of foreigners in South Africa is far more than in Europe. They don't want immigrants."Zuma said he had met with ministers to discuss what they could do to fight crime.He would also be talking to police. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
