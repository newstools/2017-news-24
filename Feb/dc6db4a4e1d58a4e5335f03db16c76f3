Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo described their apprehension as a breakthrough after the attacks over the last six months prompted two marches to the local police station where residents and students demanded the robbers’ arrest. The weekend arrest saw the duo, both 37, nabbed in Mankweng Unit D. Mojapelo said the suspects had allegedly been terrorising students who lived off campus, saying some of the crimes had been committed "with impunity". In September, a student was raped and her boyfriend shot in her room off campus. A man allegedly forced his way into her home and robbed the couple of a laptop and cellphone at gunpoint before attacking them. The man survived the shooting. A month later in October, one student was robbed in her apartment after a man knocked on the door and threatened to break it down if she did not open. Rescuer shot The victim had screamed for help but the suspect had shot the neighbour who came to her rescue, Mojapelo said. In February, a 20-year-old student was attacked, raped and robbed of her laptop and cellphone in her room, he confirmed. A tip-off led police to the arrest of the two suspects, who are now in custody. Mojapelo said a 9mm pistol, four rounds of ammunition, five laptops and six cellphones were found at the time of their arrest. "The arrested suspects are being linked to a number of cases in the area including rape, attempted murder and house robbery," Mojapelo confirmed. They are expected to appear in the Mankweng Magistrate's Court on Monday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
