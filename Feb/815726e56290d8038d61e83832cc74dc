According to Law Enforcement spokesperson, Wayne Dyason, the poachers were spotted in Camps Bay on Wednesday (8 February). He says a joint operation by the Law Enforcement Marine Unit, the police diving unit, Sanparks Rangers and Camps Bay Neighbourhood Watch members helped to disturb the poachers who, instead of removing the abalone, fled the scene. The officers conducted a thorough search of the area but found nothing and an incoming tide prevented a search of the water.&ldquo;It was dark and high tide and the poachers managed to escape. We watched the whole night, but they never came back. We waited until the morning (Thursday) for the low tide to fetch the abalone.&rdquo;The team returned on Thursday morning and found six bags containing 221 units of abalone in the water. Dyason says the abalone was taken to Camps Bay Police Station before being handed over to the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
