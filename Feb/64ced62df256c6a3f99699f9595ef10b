The number could be higher.He found the decision to move about 2 000 mentally ill patients from Life Esidimeni to 27 unlicensed NGOs was rushed, chaotic and unwise. The department decided on the move to cut costs. It had funded the Esidimeni facility.Makgoba implicated Mahlangu and two senior officials directly and called on Gauteng Premier David Makhura to consider Mahlangu's suitability as an MEC and to institute disciplinary action.He found that Mahlangu had told reporters and the Gauteng legislature that 36 patients had died when the correct number was 77 at the time.Makgoba said only one of the deaths was due to problems related to mental illness. The rest died of dehydration, diarrhoea, and other "natural causes" which needed further investigation.Shortly after the report's findings were made public Makhura told reporters that Mahlangu had resigned.Makhura vowed to take action against all other implicated officials. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
