"He didn&rsquo;t give any reasons. He just resigned as member of the DA and member of the federal council. His letter of resignation was a short one-liner," said Selfe.&nbsp;The fake documents which Jordaan is said to have leaked to the media reportedly were drawn up in conjunction with Shaun August, the chief whip of the DA in the Cape Town city council and a confidant of the mayor. &nbsp; Zille, De Lille back different candidatesThe document is a doctored version of an admission of guilt agreement in which August and Matthew Kempthorne, a senior DA councillor, admit making misrepresentations in order to buy T-shirts for the DA&rsquo;s campaign during last year&rsquo;s municipal elections, Rapport reported. &nbsp; &nbsp;The agreement and sentence that each forfeit a month&rsquo;s salary, was approved just over two weeks ago by the DA&rsquo;s federal legal committee. De Lille quit days later as the DA's Western Cape leader, but denied her decision had anything to do with August and Kempthorne's admission of guilt.&nbsp;August couldn&rsquo;t be reached for comment on Monday.&nbsp;Jordaan told Rapport that Western Cape Premier Helen Zille had, during last weekend&rsquo;s federal council meeting, voiced her displeasure at the light sentences that August and Kempthorne had received.August, Bonginkosi Madikizela, Lennit Max and Dr Arlene Adams are in the running for the DA&rsquo;s top provincial job.Zille apparently supports Madikizela, the housing MEC, while August is De Lille&rsquo;s favoured candidate.&nbsp;Madikizela last week caused controversy in the party when he said the race card was being used against him. &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Top leadership is interfering' He apparently said his opponents weren&rsquo;t convinced that he would be successful because he didn't represent the biggest racial group in the Western Cape.&nbsp;Ralph Mathekga, political analyst at the Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection (Mistra), said the DA wasn't dealing with the real issues in the party and, for that reason, it would always struggle. &nbsp;"There is no doubt that the DA is growing. Its biggest challenge is internal matters, which are not being dealt with properly. It always seems as if the top leadership is interfering to some extent in high profile cases. A prime example of this is the selection of a successor when a leader steps down. Look at the drama surrounding Mmusi Maimane," he said.&nbsp;Mathekga also believes that factions within the party are aggravating matters.&nbsp;"There are the old Independent Democrats (ID) and also members of the old DA. When they merged, it was the DA which took over the ID, yet the two factions and groups remain. It can&rsquo;t work that way. A political party&rsquo;s maturity is measured in the way with which it deals with sensitive matters," he said. &nbsp;&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
