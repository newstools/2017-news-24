Jiba told Zuma she was appealing the court&rsquo;s decision and that she had a reasonable prospect of success.The high court granted them leave to appeal on January 30.Judge Francis Legodi ruled on September 15 last year that the two be struck off the roll of advocates, following an application brought by the General Council of the Bar. This was due to their failure to prosecute former police crime intelligence head Richard Mdluli on fraud and corruption charges.The two are still on special leave as per their arrangement with the National Director of Public Prosecutions.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
