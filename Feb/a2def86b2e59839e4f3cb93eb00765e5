The finals will be played on March &nbsp;5. Describing the recent attacks on xenophobia as &ldquo;senseless acts of violence,&rdquo; Makhura cautioned that events of previous years where foreigners were killed and displaced, could not be repeated now. Makhura said that various soccer stars from other parts of Africa were involved in the games including William Okpara, Roger Fetumba, Kalusha Bywala, Timothy Bathabire, Innocent Chikoya, and Patrick Maverick. Local soccer legends would include Jomo Sono, Disco Makua, Doctor Khumalo, Brian Baloyi, Kennedy Makara, Thapelo Liau and Portia Modise. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
