The NWBF wishes to put it on record that the retreat today was not any form of surrender on its part," said the forum on Wednesday.The organisation has been calling for Mahumapelo to step down and account before the law for his alleged involvement in corruption in the platinum-rich province.Modiri said the threat of litigation was welcomed by most of his peers.Mahumapelo had threatened to sue the forum should he not receive a written apology for the allegations by February 2."We do not have bloody hands, we will submit ourselves to the process but the premier must also be subjected to investigations," he said.The business forum secretary said Mahumapelo had a duty to explain some of his ill-gotten gains to people in his province."The call for the resignation of the premier continues and his woes are not over yet. The NWBF is relentless," it said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
