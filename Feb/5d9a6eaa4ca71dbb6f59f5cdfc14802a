She said that in 2014 she had become aware that around 40 000 low-cost subsidy homes had been built without these features, causing residents much discomfort.The lack of these features gave rise to damp conditions and poor indoor air quality, which could cause respiratory illnesses."As part of our commitment to redressing the wrongs of the past, we undertook this large-scale ceiling retrofit project," she said in a statement.The City started with the second phase of the project this month and would invest R60m to install ceilings and weatherproof roofs in Macassar, Chris Nissen, Gordon's Bay, Heinz Park, Phumlani, Silver City and Sir Lowry's Pass Village.The project also includes fixing roof leaks and installing safer ceiling lighting.De Lille visited residents in Heinz Park, Philippi, on Tuesday morning to inspect the progress being made."Residents are already reaping the benefits and seeing major improvements in their quality of life, and with their energy usage," she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
