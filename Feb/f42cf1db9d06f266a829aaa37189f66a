Around 4.6 million people are expected to receive food assistance in the first part of 2017, according to the World Food Program.South Sudan's government, and to a lesser extent rebel forces, have blocked UN peacekeepers and humanitarian assistance in parts of the country, despite repeatedly promising unfettered access, according to aid organisations.Recent fighting between government and rebel forces in the Wau Shilluk area of the Upper Nile region have caused humanitarian organisations to temporarily suspend their operations there.A December letter from South Sudan's National Security Service ordered aid organisations to "immediately pullout," without giving a reason, from Panyijar in the Unity region, where thousands of displaced civilians were receiving assistance. Some aid organisations say they have since been allowed back in the area.South Sudan's government spends roughly half of its national budget on defense spending. Since 2005, the US has sent roughly $11bn in aid to South Sudan.South Sudan's civil war has killed tens of thousands of people and a peace deal signed in August 2015 has failed to stop fighting.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
