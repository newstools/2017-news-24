Around 2 000 people demonstrated outside a courthouse to demand justice for Theo, a 22-year-old youth worker who required surgery after his arrest last week in the gritty suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois. The protest in the northern suburb of Bobigny near Aulnay-sous-Bois was peaceful at the start but groups of demonstrators later clashed with police and went on the rampage, attacking cars, shops and public property. Several vehicles were torched and bus shelters and shopfronts smashed in Bobigny and neighbouring areas. A little girl trapped in a burning car was rescued by a 16-year-old demonstrator, who was heralded as a hero on social media. The police accused "several hundred" individuals of various "acts of violence and damage." The rioting capped a week of nightly clashes in the northern Paris suburb over the treatment of Theo, who claims a police officer sodomised him with his baton after a stop-and-search check in a housing estate. Around 50 people have been detained since the protests began. One officer has been charged with rape over the affair and three others with assault. All four have been suspended from their duties.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
