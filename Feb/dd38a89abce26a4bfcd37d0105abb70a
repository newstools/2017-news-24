The new funding model kicked in in January, and states have a year in which to change the necessary domestic laws and regulations to collect money for their contributions.&ldquo;We have agreed that we have to pay for ourselves,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is a question of independence and dignity and the ability to set our own agenda.&rdquo;He said the AU&rsquo;s programmes are 97% funded by external donors, &ldquo;and as of December 2016, less than half of member states had paid their assessment in full&rdquo;.Significant funding gap&nbsp;Kagame said the AU&rsquo;s resolution on financing in Kigali was also the catalyst for drawing up the institutional reform plan. &ldquo;That is not an accident. Once you&rsquo;re the one paying, you automatically become more concerned about getting good value for money,&rdquo; he said. He said it wasn&rsquo;t only up to the bigger states to pay, but everyone had to contribute their fair share.According to the finance proposals, each member state should impose a 0.2% levy on imports from outside the continent in order to pay their AU dues. It will then finance 100% of the operational budget, 75% of the programme budget and 25% of the peace support operations programme. According to the document, about 30 out of the 55 member states &ldquo;default either partially or completely on average annually&rdquo;.This created &ldquo;a significant funding gap between planned budget and actual budget&rdquo;.Former AU Commission deputy chairperson Erastus Mwencha said it would be clear by December only whether the AU had enough money to fund its programmes this year.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
