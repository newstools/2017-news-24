The ANC plans to use the opportunity to discuss its &ldquo;12 urgent tasks of the movement to radical economic transformation&rdquo; with its supporters.After the ANC took a bruising in the local government elections in August, officials from its Luthuli House headquarters in Johannesburg have been moving through regions, cap in hand, asking branches to help rebuild support.The IJR said what the ANC should really be paying attention to was making sure that it was clear about its policies and clarify what it meant by &ldquo;radical economic transformation&rdquo;.Participants in surveys had flagged inequality as the biggest threat to stability in the country. Instead of focusing on fixing this, political parties were fighting with the ANC and the ANC was fighting with itself, the IJR said.Despite the torrid time Zuma had in 2016, he was still very much in charge of the country and powerful within his party.However, only 34% of the people surveyed for the 2015 Afrobarometer said they trusted him &ldquo;somewhat&rdquo; or &ldquo;a lot&rdquo;, the IJR said. This was down from 62% in 2011. Only 42% said they trusted Members of Parliament.The IJR warned that as the ANC moved towards it elective conference in December, it should look past its own self-interest to ensure that state institutions did not become collateral damage.&ldquo;Failure in this regard will have consequences, also beyond the limits of ANC rule. Indeed, a scenario where the ANC loses power in an upcoming national election no longer seems entirely implausible,&rdquo; it said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
