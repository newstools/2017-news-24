Dam levels are currently lower than at any other point since 1980. WATCHCape Town &ndash; A &ldquo;monumental effort&rdquo; is needed to decrease Cape Town&rsquo;s water consumption after usage increased by nearly 20 million litres per day in one week, the city said on Monday.&nbsp; On February 6, average water consumption stood at 807 million litres. It had increased to an average of 825 million litres per day on Monday.&nbsp; Mayor Patricia de Lille said in a statement that consumption had to be cut back immediately.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have struggled to meet the previous target and we will therefore need a monumental effort to reduce consumption further,&rdquo; she said. The city planned to reduce consumption to 700 million litres per day, without introducing additional measures to curb usage.&nbsp; &ldquo;If we are to reduce the consumption to 700 million litres of collective use per day at the current evaporation rates in dams, we could be looking at approximately 135 days of useable water left,&rdquo; the city said.&nbsp; The City of Cape Town implemented level 3B water restrictions at the end of January. This means that gardens may only be watered before 09:00 and after 18:00, on Tuesday and Saturdays, for not more than one hour per day, and only with a bucket or watering can.&nbsp; Annually, the metro uses about 65% of the water taken from the Western Cape water supply system. Currently, while the agriculture sector is still irrigating, the metro accounts for 40% of the use.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
