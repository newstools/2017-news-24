They want the party to re-evaluate its values.They want the party&rsquo;s leadership to step down and for an interim body to lead the ANC to its policy and national elective conferences later this year.Former TRC commissioner Fazel Randera said the stalwarts believed the NCC was an ongoing discussion with senior ANC leaders.He said the veterans would ask the party for a three-a-side meeting. It would include Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans&rsquo; council representatives, the stalwarts, and three ANC officials.&ldquo;The NCC should not just be a single event, but part of processes that should go beyond both the policy and elective conferences of the party. We need to get the process going because time is running out,&rdquo; said Randera.The stalwarts insist they do not want to undermine structures or officials in the ANC. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
