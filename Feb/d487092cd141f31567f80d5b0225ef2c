Valene.GovenderPOLITICAL parties in KZN urged communities to unite and work in partnership to fight against racism. The call was made after Dawie Kriel pleaded guilty to crimen injuria at the Durban Magistrate s Court last Friday for posting a racial statement on Facebook against the Hindu community last year. Kriel posted a controversial statement during Diwali celebrations in October last year referring to Hindu community as idol worshippers and devil disciples . Kriel s post sparked anger among the community and the DA took the matter to court. He appeared in court in November last year and the case was adjourned until 17 January. DA Provincial leader Zwakele Mncwango said: We took the matter to court last year because we believed that the racial remarks made by the accused were not acceptable. Our aim is to see the law taking its course in this case as we believe racism has no room in this country. Communities have to unite and fight against racism in South Africa. It is sad that in a democracy racism still rears its ugly head in other parts of the country. Secretary for the ANC in Dr Pixley Ka Isaka Seme zone Menzi Zwane said: We were in court when the suspect appeared to show that we are against racism irrespective whether it is directed to a black person, coloured, Indian, white or anyone. We believe that the court will give the accused a heavy sentence in order to set a record straight that racism is a crime. We will follow up on this matter until the last day of the judgment. South Africa is a country that combines different races and we should embrace our diversity and live in harmony. The case was adjourned until 3 March for sentencing. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
