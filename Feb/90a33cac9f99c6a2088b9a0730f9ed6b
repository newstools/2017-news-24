At one stage the machine used for counting had broken and the police for that reason had not had time to check the men&rsquo;s addresses, passports and identity documents.&nbsp;&ldquo;We have to verify that the men are who they claim to be before they can apply for bail,&rdquo; he said.Du Bruyn said it was suspicious that the men had travelled by car from Durban to Bloemfontein to catch a flight to Cape Town.The explanations they gave for having the money were also questionable, he said.&nbsp;The State suspects that the money was stolen because neither of the two could offer a satisfactory explanation as to why they had so much money in their possession.One of them apparently said it had been an inheritance. The other alleged that it was money from his catering business.&nbsp;Baig and Ismail will appear in court again next week when a date will be set for a formal bail application.They remain in custody.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
