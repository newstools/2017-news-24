The process has since stalled.In its last meeting the committee stressed the urgency of filling the position. It also emphasised the need to consider whether candidates had the relevant qualifications and an understanding of the broadcasting industry. Other considerations would be legal expertise and an understanding of human resources processes.The committee will also receive a briefing from Communications Minister Faith Muthambi on the interim board, the SABC's 2015/16 annual report and its 1st and 2nd quarter expenditure and performance reports. &nbsp;&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
