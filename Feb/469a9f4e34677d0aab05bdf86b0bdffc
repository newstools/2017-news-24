This is the people's parliament. South Africans should be able to come here and give expression to their struggles. SONA can be a farce, ceremonial. But the tragedy is we forget to talk about lost generation, Young people not able to find work. If he was delivering SONA, he would deal with young people getting a free year of internships and also about economic growth with space for micro-enterprise. #SONA2017 DA leader Mmusi Maimane and his wife Natalie arrives at parliament pic.twitter.com/PpIwSRmrgZAnd meanwhile on the red carpet at Parliament.FFP leader Pieter Groenewald and his wife Heewig just arrived for #SONA2017 pic.twitter.com/yXATsSaMLmEFF Western Cape Chairperson Bernard Joseph explains what they are protesting about.One of the EFF leaders discussing the demands of EFF protesters. @News24 #SONA2016 pic.twitter.com/tdJGHLL8L5Busses with ANC supporters drive past EFF protest in Adderley street.@News24 #SONA2017 pic.twitter.com/Ugb6168uHhSeems a bus dropped ANC supporters off in Adderley St, where the EFF is protesting, instead of at the Parade in Darling St where the ANC's People's Assembly is taking place.&nbsp;Police keeping ANC and EFF supporters apart.A bus filled with ANC supporters are told to go to the Grand Parade by police. #SONA2017 @News24 pic.twitter.com/GaLejY5ntIThe protesters who were at the train station have left.A small group of EFF supporters sing and dance in Adderley Street ahead of #SONA2017 @News24 pic.twitter.com/zuqF4VQ1asActing National Police Commissioner Lieutenant-General Kgomotso Phahlane told police officers on Thursday that there is nothing "foreign" about the deployment of South African National Defence Force members at president Jacob Zuma's State of the Nation Address.#SONA2017 #EFF supporters singing &quot;wangena uMalema&quot; just outside parliamentary precinct.
