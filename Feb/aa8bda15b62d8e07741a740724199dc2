It is absolutely wrong and unacceptable to throw the blame on one person."He said Ramaphosa could not deny that he and Mthethwa were in contact in the days leading up to the massacre."We are convinced that these discussions must indeed have some bearing on the decision that was taken to employ live ammunition."He said Mthethwa and Ramaphosa must be fired from their positions and be criminally charged for the massacre of the 34 mine workers at Marikana. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
