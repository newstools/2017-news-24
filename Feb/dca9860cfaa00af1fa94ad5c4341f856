President Zuma's deployment of the military to Parliament to protect him during the SONA 2017 clearly shows that the pleas of people in the Western Cape are not deserving of the president's attention, or national government's proactive action," he said.Parliament has tried to allay fears that this was part of the securitisation of Parliament, calling the deployment of the soldiers a normal yearly occurrence. &nbsp;Secretary to Parliament Gengezi Mgidlana said the soldiers would have no part in maintaining law and order at the event."The use of the term law and order is not the same as what would happen if there was violence in communities, for example, and the army was called in to assist. This is not that scenario. There is no violence right now as we speak. We are not anticipating violence scenarios," he said on Wednesday.Zuma is due to present his SONA on Thursday at 19:00. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
