It was brought to my attention that Sisanda has had to have both her eyes removed due to cancer. Understandably, the family were devastated and most concerned that their bright little girl could never go to school. After making some enquiries, I found a boarding school for the visually impaired, who, after the initial interview, could tell what potential she had to learn coping skills, and accepted her to start school in January this year. Galloti said she then approached local businesses for donations towards school fees and expenses for Sisanda. We had a wonderful response and Sisanda s aunt and family would like to express their heartfelt gratitude to the people who so kindly and generously contributed. They have placed on record their thanks to: Simon and Londiwe Mkhombe of Simon Builders, Marc and Lillian Beales of GutterBrigade, Corpclo Contract Building Team, August Lhakute of Lhakute Trading, Aubrey and Hlengiwe Mahlaba of ABMM Construction, Mario Ndaba of Malema Construction, Justin Naidoo, Shirley Narayansamy, Selan of Lifestyle Superspar, and Mike Pitso and Wonder Khumalo from Ward 25 Doringkop and Anthony Griessel of The Rockman. May each one of you be blessed as you have been a blessing to others, Galloti added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
