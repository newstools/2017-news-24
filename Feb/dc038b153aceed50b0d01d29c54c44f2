I still get nightmares from the torture I endured. They beat me until some of my toenails came off," he told Amnesty.Tunisian authorities have also imposed travel bans on at least 5,000 people and restricted the movements of dozens more to prevent citizens from joining jihadist groups abroad, said Amnesty."There is no doubt that the authorities have a duty to counter security threats and protect the population from deadly attacks, but they can do so while respecting the human rights protections set out in the Tunisian constitution and international law," said Morayef, North Africa research director at Amnesty International."Giving security agencies a free hand to act above the law will not deliver security," she said."This report exposes how entrenched impunity has fostered a culture in which violations by security forces have been able to thrive."The United Nations' special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism Ben Emmerson spent five days in Tunisia earlier this year to assess progress it achieved in promoting human rights.At the end of his mission, Emmerson plauded Tunisia's efforts to counter terrorism but said "the fight should be grounded in human rights to serve as a model for the region and beyond"."I am particularly concerned about the conditions I witnessed in the Mornaguia Prison, which fall well below international minimum standards," he said.He also voiced concern about "allegations of ill-treatment and torture".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
