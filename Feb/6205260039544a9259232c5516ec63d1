Doctors Without Borders (MSF) at the time labelled the charges "extremely serious and damaging" and said its humanitarian action was not "the cause but a response" to the crisis.Frontex said in January that migrant arrivals by sea last year had plunged by almost two-thirds to 364 000 compared with 2015, mainly due to an EU border deal with Turkey that sharply reduced landings in Greece.But the agency said Italy was the exception with a record 181 000 arrivals, mostly from Africa via the Mediterranean, a 20% rise from 2015. Leggeri predicted in the interview that, because of the Libya-Italy route, "one should expect that more will come in 2017 than in 2016".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
