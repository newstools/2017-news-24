In a replying affidavit, Motsoeneng argued that claims that the decision came from him were baseless.In September the Labour Court found that the SABC 8 were irregularly fired in July for speaking out against the SABC's policy to no longer air footage of violent protests.Constitutional Court challengeThe SABC subsequently rehired Suna Venter, Foeta Krige, Krivani Pillay, Thandeka Gqubule, Busisiwe Ntuli, Lukhanyo Calata and Jacques Steenkamp. Freelance journalist Vuyo Mvoko's contract was terminated.They are taking the broadcaster to the Constitutional Court to stop what they say is its continuing "unlawful conduct".Parliament's ad hoc committee looking into the SABC board's fitness for office adopted a final draft report on Friday. In it MPs accuse Communications Minister Faith Muthambi of interfering in the SABC board's affairs and in the broadcaster's recruitment decisions.Venter was shot in the face with a pellet gun in Linden, Johannesburg, in January. She initially thought the assault was a botched robbery, but said police had told her they suspected it was part of acts of intimidation against the eight.In February, the Western Cape High Court dismissed the SABC's appeal against an earlier ruling that Motsoeneng could not work at the broadcaster in any capacity. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
