MPs are spending a second day debating President Jacob Zuma's State of the Nation address. After being thrown out of Parliament during SONA, the EFF did not attend the first day of debate.Speaking in Parliament on Tuesday, DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen said South Africans know President Jacob Zuma will never deliver on his State of the Nation Address promises.The unemployed must have been disappointed by "more rhetoric, more empty promises and another year of despair," from Zuma, he said in the National Assembly during debate on the SONA."That's why, when he droned on in that monotone, he put his own benches to sleep, and he made this nation weep," Steenhuisen said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
