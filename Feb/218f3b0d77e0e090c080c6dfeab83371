"But we have to find a plan for managing it."Food insecurity will worsen without a solution, he said. "What is of particular concern is that the pest has affected countries that are the main producers of maize."South Africa's agriculture ministry early this month said little was known about how the armyworms arrived or what their long-term effects will be."It may become a migratory pest similarly to the African armyworm and may migrate in large numbers from one area to another, causing great damage."Affected crops also include sorghum, soybeans, groundnuts and potatoes, the ministry said.The region already has been struggling with what the United Nations has called its worst drought in more than three decades.Zimbabwe, once prosperous and an exporter of maize, already has been battling food shortages for years. Over four million people, or a third of the population, are in dire need of assistance, according to the World Food Program.Ringson Chitsiko, the permanent secretary in Zimbabwe's ministry of agriculture, said the government has begun distributing pesticides and providing information to farmers.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
