The park was named as the Eco Game Park in Headlands about 140km from the capital Harare.&nbsp;The paper said Hera suffered "serious injuries to her right hip and arm when she was attacked by a caged white lion while leaning on the fence". Apparently her partner was taking pictures of her when the lion emerged from another part of the pen. (There are separate claims online that she was taking a selfie). It is not entirely clear when the attack occurred.She is now in hospital in Harare.The only record for an Eco Game Park in Headlands is the Nyati Eco Game Park.
