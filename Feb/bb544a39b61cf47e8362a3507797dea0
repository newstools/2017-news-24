But for now, I think I can't say so."The state-owned Herald newspaper on Tuesday published a 24-page supplement of congratulatory messages from government departments and regime loyalists.Local Zanu-PF party activist Sibongile Ndiweni described hosting of the party as "a blessing"."It's an honour and privilege to have such a luminary icon celebrating with us," he said."President Mugabe is a national president who has the right to have an event wherever he feels like."Zanu-PF has endorsed Mugabe as its candidate for general elections next year, and he remains widely respected as a liberation hero by other African leaders.He has avoided naming a successor, but his wife, Grace, 51, is seen as a possible candidate along with vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa.Born on February 21, 1924, Mugabe trained as a teacher and taught in what was then Rhodesia and Ghana before returning home to join the guerrilla war against white-minority rule. He became prime minister on Zimbabwe's independence from Britain in 1980 and then president in 1987.All schools around Bulawayo were closed on Thursday and Friday."Our children were told their classrooms have been turned into boarding facilities, and they are being frogmarched to join the birthday party," local poet and opposition activist Desire Moyo told AFP.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
