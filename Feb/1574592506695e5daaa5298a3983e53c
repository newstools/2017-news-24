According to the Citizen, Madonsela chose to speak out against "false news" and "lies" that "legitimise injustice" following a press conference by Mkhwebane on Thursday. Madonsela said she maintained her silence because it was the proper thing to do. She however denied that she would have to make payments for a car she is alleged to have abused while serving as Public Protector.She was referring to declarations made during Mkhwebane's news conference on Thursday that Madonsela would be charged nearly R500 000 for allegedly using her state-provided BMW for longer than she should have and for her son allegedly crashing the car after driving it without permission. Last year Madonsela said the Auditor General had found she would not be liable for the damage, as she had not given her son permission to drive the car before his accident.She explained that she has been trying to object to the amount charged through official channels, but is simply being ignored.Angry, dismissive emailsMadonsela also reportedly took issue with Mkhwebane saying that the two women were working together. She instead described a relationship that had been fraught from the outset, with Mkhwebane refusing to be part of a handover process, and that her emails to Madonsela had in fact been angry and dismissive.She also reportedly confirmed that she was made aware by her former colleagues that Mkhwebane had told a group of international ombudspersons that she would boycott their event if they invited Madonsela.According to Madonsela, Mkhwebane also unilaterally cancelled a handover meeting that was to take place on her first day of office in October 2016.She also denied speaking to Mkhwebane after the release of audio tapes during her State of Capture interview with President Jacob Zuma.Following the release of those recordings, Mkhwebane declared that Madonsela would be investigated by the police for possibly breaking the law in leaking the audio, a case that has gone nowhere.Madonsela maintains that she did nothing wrong, saying transcripts of the full recording had already been in the public domain.#PayBackForZumaShe said that she was attempting to show that Zuma had not been telling the truth when he said that he had not been given the chance to state his side of the story on the alleged state capture matter.Madonsela said she never approached Mkhwebane after the release of the president's interview. She said that she had heard from the media that Mkhwebane had reported it to the police.Madonsela reportedly added that she was breaking her silence because she believed Mkhwebane was seeking revenge for Zuma. She said she believed she was not, in fact, being made to #PayBackTheMoney, but was instead being made to #PayBackForZuma. She maintained that she never broke any rules regarding how to care for government cars.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
