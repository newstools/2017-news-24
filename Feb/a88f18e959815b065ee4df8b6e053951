Eight percent of R120 000 or whatever amount you'll be paying is nothing,&rdquo; Manabile said.They intended writing a response to Zuma by Monday.Political analyst, Dr Somadoda Fikeni, said Zuma had not presented a clear funding plan for higher education.&ldquo;He simply stated government commitment, which has already been communicated to the public, without revealing what the new funding plan is. It was a repeat of what the government is already doing.&rdquo;Fikeni said Zuma gave a fair amount of attention to higher education, but there was nothing &ldquo;radically new&rdquo; in his speech. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
