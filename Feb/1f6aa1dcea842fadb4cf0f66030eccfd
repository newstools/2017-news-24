One of her shoelaces was tied around her neck. She was bleeding from the face and genitals.Oliver, a married father of two, is the only accused still facing the rape and murder charges. His case was transferred to the Western Cape High Court.A date for Jonas to go on trial for the charge of possession of the stolen cellphone would soon be confirmed.In an affidavit, Moses told the court that Oliver had approached him on the afternoon of March 7, and asked him to help him find a buyer. He said no one wanted the iPhone as it was password-protected.The two then approached Easter, asking R400 for the top-end cellphone. Easter, in his affidavit, said he was only willing to pay R200 as it was all he had in his possession.The cellphone was tracked to his Westlake house the next day and he was arrested. Both admitted to the court that they knew the iPhone was stolen.Kevin Pietersen, for Moses, argued on Thursday that the two had pleaded guilty to possession of the cellphone, and that the court should focus on this.&ldquo;The phone was obtained in a gruesome nature, yes, but my client was never at the scene,&rdquo; he said.Monique Carstens, for Easter, agreed, saying neither had known that someone had died.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
