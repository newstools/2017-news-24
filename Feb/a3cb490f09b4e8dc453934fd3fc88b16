We will make it very, very clear that the time for illegal fishing is over."West Africa has long been plagued by illegal fishing, which represents between a third and a half of total catches, according to estimates.A report last year by the Overseas Development Institute estimated that the region loses $1.3 billion a year to illegal, unreported and unregistered fishing.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
