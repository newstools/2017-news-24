The remainder belonged to the Western Cape government. There was one transit site within the city, but it was already full, said Pillay.The case arose after the Woodstock Hub bought the quaint but run-down houses from 120 to 128 Bromwell Street from a private owner in 2013.It wanted to build mid-priced rental units costing around R9 000 a month, but could not lay a brick until the residents had moved on.The case continues after the lunch adjournment.WATCH:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
