An investigation must also be carried out to ascertain if the son was driving the state vehicle for the first time or he was used to doing so," the league's secretary general, Meokgo Matuba, said.The women&rsquo;s league was responding to Madonsela&rsquo;s apology and commitment to pay the government for the state vehicle damaged in an accident that happened while it was being driven by her son.Madonsela apologised to South Africans and the government for the incident, saying her decision to pay for the damages was informed by her "moral compass and ethical considerations".But the league said this was not enough."The ANCWL welcomes the decision by Advocate Madonsela to pay for the car repairs and accepts her apology. However, apology is not a substitute for the law to take its course."Courts of law must be the final arbitrator on the matter of state vehicle being driven by someone not employed by the state. Whoever authorised that must face the law. If the car was stolen, the one who stole it must face the law," Matuba said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
