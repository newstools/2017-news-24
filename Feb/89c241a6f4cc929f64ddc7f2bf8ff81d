John Yeld, GroundUpCape Town - The &ldquo;independent&rdquo; geological consultant who said the catastrophic collapse of a sea cliff in front of a West Coast mineral sands mine was caused by natural events, was employed by the mine when he wrote this in a report, GroundUp&nbsp;reported on Wednesday.&nbsp; This emerged in the Western Cape High Court this week, during a review application brought by Australian mining company Mineral Sands Resources (MSR). It extracts mineral sands like zircon, ilmenite, rutile, magnetite and garnet at its Tormin beach mine, 400km from Cape Town on the coast near Lutzville.Environmental authorities conducted a search-and-seizure operation in September last year. The company is now facing criminal charges for allegedly causing environmental degradation.

In his &ldquo;Cliff Failure Memorandum&rdquo; dated December 2015, Du Toit wrote that the &ldquo;combination of rainfall and storm activity erosion is the main reason for cliff failure during or after storm events&rdquo;.MSR&rsquo;s environmental compliance officer Sibonelo Mkhize states in court papers: &ldquo;[Du Toit&rsquo;s] conclusion was that the main reason for cliff failure in this area is the undercutting of the cliff face by wave activity.&rdquo;Paschke said that by Du Toit&rsquo;s own admission on his profile on social networking site LinkedIn, MSR had employed him as exploration manager and mine environmental superintendent from January 2015 to June 2016.The departments cite independent consulting soil scientist Dr Johan van der Waals. In a preliminary report in December last year, he said there had been no similar cliff failures in the area since 2003.&ldquo;The argument that cliff failures are naturally occurring events in the area is supported, but the scale of the failure on the coastal side of the treatment facility is considered to have been induced and exacerbated by human activities and a failure to process water adequately,&rdquo; Van der Waals wrote.Paschke argued that none of MSR&rsquo;s attacks on the issuing of the warrant were justified. He asked that the application to set the warrant aside be dismissed. However, if the judge agreed with MSR and declared the warrant illegal, the evidence collected during the search-and-seizure operation should be preserved, he said.Earlier, Advocate Peter Hodes SC, for MSR, had argued that the warrant was invalid for reasons including &ldquo;serious non-disclosure&rdquo; and &ldquo;false and misleading&rdquo; statements by the environmental authorities.The application continues on Thursday.- Mineral Sands Resources is a subsidiary of Mineral Commodities Ltd that trades on the Australian Securities Exchange as MRC. MRC is the company that for 13 years attempted to develop a mineral sands mine at Xolobeni, on the Pondoland coastline of Transkei, before announcing in July last year it was selling its stake in this highly-controversial project to its BEE partner.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
