Teboho.SetenaThe Karee Dam is completely dry, leaving residents in the area without fresh drinking water. The dam, located in the Pixley ka Seme District Muni cipality, is a cause for concern, the Department of Water and Sanitation said. The department is concerned about the level of water at the Karee Dam, which is at 0%. The water, supplied to the residents of Calvinia by seven boreholes, should be sufficient during this period, said Amogelang Moholoeng, the department s spokesperson. The dam s inability to supply residents and farmers with water for their daily living creates a major problem.
