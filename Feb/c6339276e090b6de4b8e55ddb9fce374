We hope the Luba will do the same".Luba tribal chief Mwamba Baruti echoed his counterpart, saying that "the war between the two communities has now ended".He added: "We are confident about the future".Tensions between the two peoples stretch back before DRC gained independence from Belgium in 1960.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
