[Thuli] Madonsela to acknowledge the letter," Mkhwebane's office said on Sunday.It said the letter offered both to pay for the damages to a car which was involved in an accident while being driven by her son, as well as to reimburse the office for her use of another car for a month."[Mkhwebane] still awaits the legal opinion from the state attorney for future reference," her office said.On Saturday, Madonsela's foundation issued a statement saying her decision to pay was informed by her "moral compass and ethical considerations".In a letter sent to Mkhwebane, dated February 10, Madonsela also withdrew her objection for being charged for VIP protection services during the off-duty period determined by the police VIP unit to end on November 30, last year.She has also expressed her gratitude for statements issued by the Auditor General confirming her long-standing assertion that the vehicle repair matter was the subject of an audit query.Madonsela remained convinced that the law was on her side regarding both the merits of the case and administrative justice implications of the Public Protector process.She admitted that she could have handled the matter better."Our moral compass is compromised when we forget that we are not echoes of those that are against us or appear to be so. Those of us who believe in a better world must be the first to do what we believe is right or needs to be done to achieve such a world," she said at the time.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
