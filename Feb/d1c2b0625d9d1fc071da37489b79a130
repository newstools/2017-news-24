It called the move by Sanral "litigious behaviour and the continuous waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money".It continued: "The tolling of urban road infrastructure is fundamentally wrong, as these are roads the public use for daily commuting and for which they pay taxes."OUTA further maintained that government should scrap the "failed" Gauteng e-toll system, "which now has extremely low compliance levels of around 20%". Sanral said it would abide by Friday&rsquo;s judgment of the Constitutional Court. The agency said that it would now "continue to engage the City of Cape Town to find a solution to the growing congestion crisis in the Winelands area".Sanral spokesperson Vusi Mona previously said that discussions were already underway with the city.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
