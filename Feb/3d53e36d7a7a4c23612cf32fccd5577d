Such writings are also against Sudanese law and the constitution," he said.Ghazouli has filed a case against Nur and also approached the Sudanese press council."They will now decide whether this amounts to apostasy," he said, a charge which can carry the death penalty in Sudan in case of conviction.Ghazouli has condemned Nur in one of his sermons at a Friday prayer gathering in a Khartoum mosque. Nur said she is also being targeted by Mustafa al-Tayeb, editor of the hardline newspaper El-Sina and an uncle of President Omar al-Bashir.Nur had to be prevented from corrupting Sudan's values, Tayeb wrote in his newspaper last week, urging his readers to "protect their religion".Nur's own newspaper, an independent daily, is backing her."Shamael al-Nur is a young journalist with a great future. She is active and has a strong will," said Osman Mirgani, editor of Al-Tayar."She has strong views about journalism and that makes her different from others."The Paris-based Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has also raised her case."We urge the authorities to do what is necessary to protect Al-Nur and the rest of Al-Tayar's personnel and to condemn these calls for hate and violence," RSF said last week.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
