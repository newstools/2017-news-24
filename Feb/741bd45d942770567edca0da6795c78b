The company, known as Glocom, is operated by Pyongyang's intelligence agency, according to the report.North Korean companies and banks blacklisted by the United Nations are continuing to operate "by using agents who are highly experienced and well-trained in moving money, people and goods, including arms and materiel, across borders," the report said.The Security Council has imposed six sets of sanctions on North Korea - two of which were adopted last year to significantly ramp up measures and deny Kim Jong-Un's regime hard currency revenue.China, Pyongyang's main trading partner, has suspended all imports of coal from North Korea for the remainder of the year to shore up its compliance with the sanctions resolution.The report however said that implementation of the sanctions by UN member-states "remains insufficient and highly inconsistent."The European Union on Monday moved to tighten sanctions, imposing fresh restrictions on trade in coal, iron and iron ore, and banning imports of copper, nickel, silver and zinc from North Korea.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
