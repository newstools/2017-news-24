Aid groups have slammed a "man-made" famine caused by bloodshed in South Sudan where civil war has forced people to flee, disrupted agriculture, sent prices soaring and cut off aid agencies from some of the worst-hit areas.South Sudan has been engulfed by civil war since 2013 after President Salva Kiir accused his rival and former deputy Riek Machar of plotting a coup.The UNHCR said since the war erupted nearly 330 000 South Sudanese refugees have arrived in Sudan fleeing war and food insecurity in their country.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
