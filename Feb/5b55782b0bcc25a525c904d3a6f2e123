Graca Machel, who is highly respected in both Mozambique and South Africa where she was the wife of former president Nelson Mandela, said she was disappointed that Licuco had escaped a custodial sentence."I had hoped and wanted him to go to prison for a very simple reason: all aggressors, all of those who abuse women should get the message that if they do that, they will end up in prison," she said."If not, it gives the impression that if they pay they go unpunished."According to NGOs, violence against women is on the increase in Mozambique. During this year's New Year celebrations, cases of sexual assault were 25% higher than a year earlier.In December another high profile case of domestic violence hit the headlines when Valentina Guebuza, the daughter of former president Armando Guebuza was shot dead by her husband during an argument.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
