There are no financial blocks on the registration of NSFAS funded students,&rdquo; De Ruyter said.The deadline to register had been extended to this Friday.A total of 53 719 students, more than 85% of the total number, 60 505, the university could accommodate at all its campuses this year, had already registered for the 2017 academic year.For two days last week, TUT shut down its Pretoria West, Arts and Arcadia Campuses after students blocked the entrance of the Pretoria West campus with burning tyres. They were protesting against a lack of accommodation. &nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
