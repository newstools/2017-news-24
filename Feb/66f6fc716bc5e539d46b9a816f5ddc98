He has been charged with trying to overthrow President Robert Mugabe's government and insulting the national flag.A wildly-popular figure before he fled into exile last July, Mawarire has come in for criticism from disappointed Zimbabweans who feel he left them and the #ThisFlag movement in the lurch - even though it later emerged that Mawarire's wife was pregnant.Lawyer Mahere said: "Do we hold onto disappointment that he chose family over fame - or do we rally behind what his incarceration represents for us as a country?"24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
