Many improvements have been made in terms of security services, security efficiency, security of hotels, the level of general security in the whole country".&nbsp;Little security&nbsp;Britain's Foreign Office warns against all travel to some border regions of Tunisia and "all but essential travel" to the rest of the country. Tunisia's economy is heavily dependent on tourism and has repeatedly asked for the warning to be lifted.Samantha Leek, the main lawyer for the inquest, said at one of the hearings that a report by a Tunisian judge had identified failings by local security which could have ended the attack before more police arrived and killed Rezgui."He said the units that should have intervened in the events deliberately and unjustifiably slowed down to delay their arrival at the hotel," she said."They had the ability to put an end to the attack before the police arrived but wasted a considerable amount of time in getting to the hotel," she added.Ammar said the accusation that the police had deliberately delayed their arrival was "exaggerated and unfair".A report on security at the hotels by a British embassy staff member conducted in January 2015 was also read out in court during one of the hearings by Andrew Ritchie, a lawyer representing 20 victims' families."There seems to be little in the way of effective security to prevent or respond to an attack" from the beach, he quoted the report as saying. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
