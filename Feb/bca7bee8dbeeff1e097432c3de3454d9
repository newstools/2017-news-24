The have called for February 9 to instead be set aside to debate Parliament's failure to "hold Zuma to account, despite a clear ruling by the Constitutional Court that he had failed to uphold his oath of office". In a letter to the Speaker's office, the party has also proposed a discussion on threats to the Constitution and democracy, in place of Zuma's address. "It is clear that the Speaker and the entire ANC caucus are hell-bent on rendering our Constitution useless and ushering of lawlessness in our country, which is a serious threat to our democracy. "South Africa must rest assured that we, as the protectors of the public, will fight with all we have to ensure that the rule of law reigns supreme," party spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said in a statement.&nbsp; The party has also rejected Parliament's decision to ask the State Security Agency to vet all guests attending SONA. "There is no provision in law for such. This, again, is a demonstration of Parliament's determination to render our country a lawless and mafia state." The party would not be complying with this illegal arrangement, Ndlozi said.&nbsp; "The EFF will not retreat in its courageous and consistent action of holding Mr Zuma accountable and will never allow South Africa's Constitution to be undermined."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
