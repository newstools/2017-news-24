Before discarding his jacket, he peered at the T-shirt's label, and said he would not wear it because it was not made locally.According to the label, it was made in China.But, without skipping a beat, Nehawu provincial deputy chairperson Philiswa Nzimande told Fuzile to make sure there was money in the budget to boost local manufacturing.The SA Clothing and Textile Workers Union has repeatedly urged fellow unions to source their T-shirts locally, in a bid to boost the local textile industry. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
