Many have died tried to climb them, some shot by Moroccan forces.Other migrants, most of them from sub-Saharan Africa, take to rickety boats to try to cross the narrow stretch of sea between Morocco and Spain's southern tip.According to the International Organization for Migration, 13 246 migrants arrived in Spain last year, more than 8 100 of whom came by sea.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
