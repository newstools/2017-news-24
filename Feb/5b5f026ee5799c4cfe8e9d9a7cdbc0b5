I'm not talking about the big, prestigious organisations, but all the small ones that seem to have sophisticated hardware, such as drones," Zuccaro said."That's expensive, and we're just looking into who is financing them and why," he added.The Maltese organisation Moas was the first to launch a private rescue vessel in the summer of 2014. By last summer close to ten different NGOs, financed mainly through private donations, were taking part in migrant relief operations off Libya.Those with one or more boats in the area in 2016 included German NGOs Sea Watch, Sea Eye and Jugend Rettet, as well as the Dutch Lifeboat Project, the Spanish Proactiva Open Arms and Moas.Most of their boats are in currently docked at port for the winter, but the Aquarius - charted by SOS Mediterranee and Doctors Without Borders (MSF) - rescued hundreds of people earlier this month, along with the Golfo Azzuro, run by Proactiva Open Arms.In a report cited in December by the Financial Times daily, the EU's border control agency Frontex raised the possibility traffickers putting migrants out to sea could be in collusion with the private ships that recover them and bring them to Italy "like taxis".The allegation was slammed by MSF as "extremely serious and harmful". It said the NGOs were "not the cause but a response" to a humanitarian crisis, and had been forced to act because Frontex was failing to prevent migrant deaths at sea.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
