He said the strike was anchored on "the unpalatable inability" by the ministry of health to resolve the major issues raised by the state doctors, particularly 120 trained doctors who would be out of work in the next two weeks, low salaries and allocation of vehicles. He charged that Parirenyatwa&rsquo;s notice to the effect that posts would be created to accommodate the 120 doctors fell short of clarifying when the post would be availed, adding that the proposed dates for resolving the on call allowances and duty free facility for vehicles "are not an accurate reflection of both the urgency which this matter deserves and the time for which they have been outstanding".State doctors are currently earning $1.20 per hour as on call allowances but are demanding $720 per month with immediate effect.Parirenyatwa could not immediately comment as officials said he was in meetings.But the main opposition MDC-T added its weight on the impasse, with Morgan Tsvangirai&rsquo;s secretary for secretary of health, Dr Ruth Labode, telling News24 that the crisis in Zimbabwe&rsquo;s health sector was not surprising."The doctors are justified because they are under paid and working in institutions that are poorly equipped," said Labode, who served for several years as the Provincial Medical Doctor for the Matabeleland North region.Union leaders expect a full-blown strike as the week&rsquo;s progresses unless the government gives in to their major demands.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
