King's nose was completely out of joint after The King and I gave birth to a foal on&nbsp;a farm outside Stellenbosch.&nbsp;&ldquo;The foal, also a mare, was born prematurely and the billy-goat was bigger than her. We noticed after a few days that King was becoming jealous. The mare didn&rsquo;t mind having two children, but King started butting her when her foal wanted to drink. &nbsp;&ldquo;We decided to keep them apart at night,&rdquo; said Petro Botha, co-owner of The King and I.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;d initially thought that The King and I would reject or hurt the goat after foaling, but she wanted to keep both.&rdquo;Personalities&nbsp;Botha said there was no guarantee that the use of another animal would help calm a horse. It doesn't have the same effect on all horses.&ldquo;As a breeder you have to know with what personalities you are working. King of the Highland, a national champion who&rsquo;d sired The King and I, had also been nervous before a show and she&rsquo;s inherited that from him.&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp;Botha added that The King and I&rsquo;s nervousness influenced her performance at shows.&nbsp;&ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t stand still and paced up and down in the stables before going onto the stage. One could almost say she had stage fright.&rdquo;&nbsp;King was bought to calm her down &ndash; and it almost immediately happened.&nbsp;The two &ldquo;children&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t giving The King and I too much trouble. As soon as they&rsquo;re let out of the stables, the two run alongside each other and sometimes even play.The King and I is six years old and mated with another champion, Four by Four. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting several suggestions for a name, but we are still looking at her characteristics and are trying to identify her strong suits before giving her a name.&rdquo;&nbsp;Botha said the million dollar question was if they were going to put The King and I on show again, or use her for breeding.&nbsp;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have an answer to that question yet.&rdquo; The billy-goat gives the foal a fright while its mother The King and I has her back turned.
