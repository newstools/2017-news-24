DA MP Yusuf Cassim said the NYDA was "an employment agency for the African National Congress Youth League elite and its alliance partners". ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu welcomed the National Assembly&rsquo;s approval of the board&rsquo;s appointment. "We are confident that these selected candidates are fit, proper and capable to discharge their responsibilities. We have no doubt that they will hit the ground running when they start their term as board members in serving the youth of South Africa." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
