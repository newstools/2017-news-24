If Parliament can operate in the manner it operated, we won't have a situation where we have to run to the courts, or to the Public Protector."We had to do that because we had failed [in the past]."Mokoena described the inquiry as a first, professional and largely effective."We are happy with the recommendations against the minister. We would have liked more investigation into the state capture allegations at the SABC, but we are not going to get everything," he said."We are happy that the inquiry unearthed some of the starvation of our coverage during the elections."Committee chairperson Vincent Smith said the process had been a marathon and had tested the mental and physical abilities of MPs, but that he was happy with the outcome."All in all, I think members worked as a team across party lines."Where we had differences, we were able to resolve them, not because we met each other as political parties, but we were all of the view it was Parliament we were trying to protect and serve."Smith said he hoped it was a sign of how parties could work together in Parliament.DA to keep 'close eye' on implementationThe DA, meanwhile, welcomed the adoption of the final report.It commended the work done by the committee, but said it was unfortunate that the SABC had to deteriorate to such an extent before something was done."It is apparent that the ANC had no political will to address the rot within the National Broadcaster and any attempt by the DA to use parliamentary mechanisms were blocked," a party statement said on Friday.The party said it became evident that Communications Minister Faith Muthambi "not only lied to the committee in her responses, but was also the central figure in ensuring that former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng continued his reign of terror at the SABC".The DA was the only party that wanted to take further action against Muthambi. All other parties resolved to refer these breaches to the Ethics Committee and the president for investigation."The DA will keep a close eye on the implementation of the recommendations."If, after a reasonable time, these recommendations are not implemented effectively, the DA will not hesitate to institute criminal or other charges against any persons, including the Minister, who willfully mislead the committee."The report will be tabled in Parliament on Monday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
