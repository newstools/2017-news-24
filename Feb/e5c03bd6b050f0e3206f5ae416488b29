System?A 69-year-old grandfather was convicted and sentenced to 45 years imprisonment for three counts of rape last week at the KwaDukuza Regional Court. In 2014, at Glendale, the grandfather was looking after his two grandchildren, aged 9 and 11, while their mother was at work. According to KZN SAPS spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala, the accused would call the victims on different occasions and rape them. He continued doing this until he was caught in the act by a neighbour who reported the matter to the victim s mother. When the young girls were questioned they confirmed the incident. The matter was reported to the police and the docket was transferred to KwaDukuza Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for further investigation. The accused was arrested and charged accordingly. Another 13-year-old victim came forward and told her teacher that in 2014, she was repeatedly raped by the accused who was her neighbour and the matter was also reported to the po-lice. Another charge of rape was added. The grandfather made several court appearances until he was senten- ced. It's sad and disappointing that the people who are supposed to protect and love the victims are the one abusing them. As a society it is our duty to protect our future leaders from such people. We would like to encourage communities and members of the family to continue to report such act to the police, said KwaZulu-Natal acting provincial commissioner Major General Bheki Langa.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
