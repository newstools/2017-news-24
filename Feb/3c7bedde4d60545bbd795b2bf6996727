The university's South Campus procurement building was burnt over the weekend. Two petrol bombs were found on the scene. The words &ldquo;ANC must fall&rdquo;, &ldquo;Fuck you&rdquo;, and &ldquo;100% free education&rdquo; were spray-painted on the walls in blue paint. It was the third arson attack on the campus since October last year. &ldquo;Whilst the university has always maintained an open-door policy to engage with student bodies around legitimate issues, even during the most trying times in late 2016, it is blatantly clear that there is a small group of violent individuals wishing to cause wanton destruction,&rdquo; NMMU spokesperson Zandile Mbabela said. &ldquo;Arsonists have no place at a public university. They are criminals." The university called on anyone with information about the crime to contact Detective Sergeant Thumani on 082-303-0201 or 074-621-5039.&nbsp; The university had increased security. Mbabela asked students and staff to report all suspicious activity to a secure hotline number 041-504-9111. All information would be handled in the strictest confidence.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
