The police, however, said on Thursday they would not allow the march to go ahead because "hoodlums are planning to hijack" the protest.This reportedly led to the popular singer calling off the protests on Sunday. The musician said that they were groups that wanted to hijack his protests march, thus, he had to cancel it as "the point and intent am making is not worth the life of any Nigerian".He said the idea of the protest was to demand a better life for Nigerians. "I therefore announce the cancellation of the planned protest. We will share further information in due course.But, despite the cancellation of the march, more than a hundred protesters turned up.One of the groups behind the protests, Enough is Enough said it was protesting over a raft of issues including&nbsp;security, education, health, power and unemployment.&nbsp;Some of the placards which were carried by the protesters read: "Unemployed people are hungry and angry" and "There can't be a set of rules for the poor and another set for the rich."The protest took place as reports on Monday said that President Muhammadu Buhari had extended his UK stay for medical reasons, as rumours swirled over his health.&nbsp;See the tweets below.Small protest underway in Lagos protesting government policies #IStandWithNigeria pic.twitter.com/MWn2rjbGq1&mdash; Martin Patience (@martinpatience) February 6, 2017Small protest underway in Lagos protesting government policies #IStandWithNigeria pic.twitter.com/MWn2rjbGq1"@Olawoyin4u: Presently #IStandWithNigeria Watch this video&nbsp; TBH #GIDITRAFFIC pic.twitter.com/j8B0Rq55Ui @Gidi_Traffic&mdash; GIDITRAFFIC (@Gidi_Traffic) February 6, 2017"@Olawoyin4u: Presently #IStandWithNigeria Watch this video&nbsp; TBH #GIDITRAFFIC pic.twitter.com/j8B0Rq55Ui @Gidi_TrafficFela's song playing now"By the Grace of Almighty Lord Amen Amen Amen" Cc @_yemia @official2baba @ogundamisi @Omojuwa #IStandWithNigeria pic.twitter.com/Wn2XCboCYg&mdash; Ms Maureen Kabrik (@MKabrik) February 6, 2017Fela's song playing now"By the Grace of Almighty Lord Amen Amen Amen" Cc @_yemia @official2baba @ogundamisi @Omojuwa #IStandWithNigeria pic.twitter.com/Wn2XCboCYgFela's song playing now"By the Grace of Almighty Lord Amen Amen Amen" Cc @_yemia @official2baba @ogundamisi @Omojuwa #IStandWithNigeria pic.twitter.com/Wn2XCboCYg&mdash; Ms Maureen Kabrik (@MKabrik) February 6, 2017Fela's song playing now"By the Grace of Almighty Lord Amen Amen Amen" Cc @_yemia @official2baba @ogundamisi @Omojuwa #IStandWithNigeria pic.twitter.com/Wn2XCboCYgMarch is on.....&nbsp; #OurMumuDonDo #IStandWithNigeria pic.twitter.com/1tiMZFETD6&mdash; Charlyboy(Official) (@Areafada1) February 6, 2017March is on.....&nbsp; #OurMumuDonDo #IStandWithNigeria pic.twitter.com/1tiMZFETD6Caught up with them#IStandWithNigeria pic.twitter.com/X9lsAU3LVs&mdash; Tunji Andrews (@TunjiAndrews) February 6, 2017Caught up with them#IStandWithNigeria pic.twitter.com/X9lsAU3LVsAbuja is gathering Momentum, we are about to embark on our protest. #IStandWithNigeria #OneVoiceNigeria @_yemia @gbengasesan pic.twitter.com/Wm2AxcB4Ff&mdash; Ms Maureen Kabrik (@MKabrik) February 6, 2017 Abuja is gathering Momentum, we are about to embark on our protest. #IStandWithNigeria #OneVoiceNigeria @_yemia @gbengasesan pic.twitter.com/Wm2AxcB4FfIf you stand for nothing, you'd fall for everything!
