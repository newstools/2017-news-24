The DA has said that the ombudsman's report names nine other senior officials who also need to be suspended and disciplined.In the report Makgoba identified health MEC Qedani Mahlangu, Selebano and Manamela as the "key players" in the tragedy."Their fingerprints are peppered throughout the project. The decision was reckless, unwise and flawed, with inadequate planning and a chaotic and 'rushed or hurried' implementation process," Makgoba said.READ: Overhaul entire Gauteng health care system &ndash; SA PsychiatristsOvercrowdingThe office of Gauteng Premier David Makhura said it remains focused on implementing the recommendations of the report.Previously, spokesperson Thabo Masebe told News24 "other officials against whom adverse findings were made will also be suspended soon"."From the time when we accepted the report, we said we would swiftly implement the recommendations of the ombudsman, which is what we have been doing since last week. We continue to give the matter our utmost priority," said Masebe.The DA has called on the department of health to prioritise finding accommodation for mental health patients currently being accommodated by unlicensed NGOs.According to Bloom, existing psychiatric hospitals are overcrowded and the department should request Life Esidimeni to reopen its doors in order to house mentally ill patients.Mahlangu stepped down last week, hours before the health ombudsman released his report.Opposition parties, the EFF, DA and COPE laid charges against Mahlangu and called for Gauteng Premier David Makhura to step down.A new acting head of department has been appointed in the interim."The newly appointed acting head of the department, Dr Ernest Kenoshi, faces a daunting task in restoring morale and establishing effective management," said Bloom. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
