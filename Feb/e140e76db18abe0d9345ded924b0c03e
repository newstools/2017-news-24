Since 2013, up until today, what has the department been doing, where the only option we have left is to extend an invalid contract?"She said Treasury is on record that it will not provide the department more money to extend an invalid contract."What are you going to tell South Africans? This is the very same company that has stolen money from them for years illegally. Pensioners and grant beneficiaries have said that there were deductions on their grants."She labelled the current service providers a "bunch of crooks". CPS was on record as saying they will only do business with Sassa under "favourable" conditions.She also wanted to know if Sassa was under political pressure to extend the contract.'We have not moved an inch'DA MP Bridget Masango wanted to know why the Reserve Bank, Treasury and other national departments were not brought on sooner."We are sitting no further than in November last year when we already discussed the options. We have not moved an inch."She also said the Social Development Department accused the committee of being "naive" and "creating panic" in June last year when they raised the same objections, and now they admit they have failed and have no time.DA MP Evelyn Wilson said the most honest thing the presenters had said was that they had failed.She considered the proposal "staggering", and that Sassa had failed the Constitutional Court's seven deliverables."You have known for months that you could not deliver grants by Sassa on the April 1, and to this date, you still have not gone back to the court. Why are we sitting in this situation?She accused them of "forcing an emergency". She said the Constitutional Court has no choice now but to extend an unlawful contract."How has this situation been manipulated, and why?" she asked.'National interest'Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza said they had not approached the Constitutional Court yet as their legal team was still advising them. They have been advised that the ConCourt will grant the option as it is in the national interest.He said they followed the Constitutional Court's objectives in time, including re-advertising the tender, but that no suitable companies applied.Sassa also engaged the Treasury, the Reserve Bank and other stakeholders, who have been working with them.The Reserve Bank has already gone out to banks and discussed the option of using biometrics as security protocols."It's not that we have been resting on our laurels and have not been doing anything."He also said they have not had any political pressure at all, and will finalise the options on Monday.'The country cannot burn'"As CEO responsible for Sassa, I've got to make a decision," Magwaza said."The fact remains, the decision needs to be taken. Come April 1, people need to get paid. How we pay is the issue."If we got to choose between paying the grants, or irregular [processes]; if the country is going to burn on April 1, or irregular [processes], I choose that the country does not burn."He agreed that CPS is arrogant, and that it was not Sassa who was approaching the media.He did not want to "dwell" on the scenario that the Constitutional Court would reject their requests.Committee chairperson Rose Capa said Sassa had given the committee what it asked for, and adjourned the meeting just before lunch.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
