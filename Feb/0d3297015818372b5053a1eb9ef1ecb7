We condemn the recent outbreak and we are opposed to it," Ngwane said. &nbsp;"All we wanted was to give scared immigrants hope and to show them that there are people who care. We have a right-wing populist movement who is trying to blame the country&rsquo;s economic crisis on immigrants.&rdquo;He said if they had the power, they would mobilise people and prevent an anti-immigrant march planned in Pretoria on Friday.&ldquo;All we can do now is to raise awareness because we don&rsquo;t think xenophobia will end immediately.&rdquo;On Saturday, residents of Pretoria West raided homes they alleged were being used as brothels and drug dens. They called on &ldquo;pimps&rdquo; to release prostitutes and send them back home. Two houses were set alight.On February 11, at least 10 houses allegedly being used for drug dealing and prostitution were set alight in Rosettenville, Johannesburg. Locals alleged that Nigerians were the source of the criminal activity. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
