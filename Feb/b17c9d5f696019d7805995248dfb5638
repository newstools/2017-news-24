Vuyo Dondashe, 22, appeared in the Strand Magistrate's Court on Monday on two counts of murder. The case was postponed to Thursday for further investigation. He will remain in custody until then. The motive for the murders had not yet been established. Dondashe allegedly stabbed his sleeping mother and sister to death in front of a 5-year-old relative after arriving home in the early hours of Saturday morning. According to the City of Cape Town, he fled the scene on foot. A neighbour spotted him walking along Victoria Road and called a traffic inspector. The inspector and a manager at a driver’s licence testing centre approached the man and asked him for his name and address. They searched him and found a knife wrapped in a black bag. Police were alerted and the man was arrested. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
