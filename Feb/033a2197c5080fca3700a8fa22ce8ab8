Because the last 10% of a dam&rsquo;s water was not useable, the average level was effectively at 27.5%.De Lille urged all residents to use less water. Warning notices would be issued to the metro&rsquo;s highest domestic, commercial and government water users.Level 3b water restrictions were approved on Thursday, allowing the City to issue spot fines of up to R5 000 to residents contravening water restrictions.Watering and irrigation of gardens may only take place on Tuesdays and Saturdays before 09:00 or after 18:00, for not more than one hour a day, and only with a bucket or watering can.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
