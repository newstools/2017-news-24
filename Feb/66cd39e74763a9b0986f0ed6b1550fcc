"I look forward to continuing to strengthen the close relationship between our two countries."Earlier, the human rights organisation Reprieve urged Johnson to speak about the abuses it described, including the case of Irish national Ibrahim Halawa, who was 17 when arrested and imprisoned in Cairo in 2013.Halawa was detained in a mosque near Ramses Square as the Muslim Brotherhood held a "day of rage" over al-Sisi's ouster of his predecessor, the Islamist Mohamed Morsi.Reprieve's Harriet McCulloch had implored Johnson to "urge al-Sisi to end these appalling abuses, and free Ibrahim and the many like him." No mention of Halawa was made in Johnson's statement.Before the visit, Johnson said "the UK is a champion of a renewed Egypt because stability, peace and growth in this region are the bedrock of opportunity and security."Britain also pledged to boost university partnerships and teacher training, increase funding of economic development and social welfare programs, and increase funding new and existing social startups.Egypt is undergoing painful economic adjustments as part of al-Sisi's economic reform measures, with inflation hitting 30% in January in a climate where state repression and mass arrests have blocked off most forms of dissent or opposition.Johnson and his Egyptian counterparts did not make themselves available for questions by the media following the meeting.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
