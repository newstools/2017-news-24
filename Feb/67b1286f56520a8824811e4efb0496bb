Jammeh withdrew his nation from the group in 2013, calling it "an extension of colonialism", but Johnson has his own history of controversy with Britain's former territories in Africa.&nbsp;Controversial comments&nbsp;In a news column published in 2002, Johnson characterised the Commonwealth as having "crowds of flag-waving piccaninnies," to welcome Queen Elizabeth II, using a derogatory term for black people that caused outrage. He also parodied reaction to Tony Blair's arrival in Congo saying that "the tribal warriors will all break out in watermelon smiles to see the big white chief touch down".The comments came back to haunt him when he ran for London mayor in 2008, and then again when he was named foreign secretary last year after Britain's shock Brexit vote.Diplomatic sources have said Britain is likely to target justice reform as an area in which it can provide expertise to the new government.In a show of confidence in the Gambian tourist industry, which is dominated by British sunseekers, Johnson is taking a commercial flight to Banjul, and will also meet hoteliers.Tourists were flown out of the country en masse in January after Jammeh declared a state of emergency when he lost the election to Barrow but refused to stand down.On Wednesday morning, Johnson will head to Ghana to meet President Nana Akufo-Addo and visit the Blue Skies company, a juice-maker which has received financial support from Britain.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
