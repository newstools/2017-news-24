"The really good news is that other businesses are benefitting from it," he said.Travellers stopping to buy marijuana in Parachute are more likely to stop at restaurants and other shops, he said, helping an economy that was hit hard by a downturn in natural gas production.Parachute Mayor Roy McClung said the town's economy would have been in serious trouble without legalised recreational marijuana.Statewide, marijuana sales brought in close to $200m in taxes and fees last year, the Colorado Department of Revenue said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
