It was done to cut costs.Van Rensburg called for the differential licensing of non-governmental organisations.There should be one licence for those who provided safe residential care, another for those who provided psycho-social rehabilitative care, and another still for those who provided daycare services.Van Rensburg said those patients transferred from the Life Esidimeni Hospital should be immediately moved back.&ldquo;[They should] be accommodated in facilities such as those operated by Life Esidimeni Hospital, as a safe temporary 'holding space', until the detail and logistics of the implementation of a proper de-institutionalisation process could be established.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
