Last week, the SABC lost another court bid to appeal a December court decision to set aside former&nbsp;chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng's appointment as group executive for corporate affairs.EFF MP Fana Mokoena said current acting CEO James Aguma needed to write to the committee to explain why the SABC was still going to court regarding Motsoeneng's appointment.ANC MP Hlomane Chauke said the portfolio committee on communications needed to deal with the matter, as it was in its mandate.He said there was alleged evidence of fraudulent contracts being signed in December, and that the portfolio committee now needed to deal with it, as the ad hoc committee would dissolve at the end of February.DA MP Phumzile van Damme agreed, and said it was time the portfolio committee pulled up its socks.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
