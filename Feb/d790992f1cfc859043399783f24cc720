The allegations initially surfaced in 2015, more than a decade after Trollip had sold the farm, and were constantly raised against Trollip during his mayoral election campaign.An ANC press conference presented eight of the Bedford farmworkers to the media in late July last year, just days before the local municipal elections.Claims of more evidenceTrollip has denied the allegations and has argued that Troon deliberately set out to defame him, causing irreparable harm to his name and reputation.Troon asked for a postponement on Monday, saying his witnesses, the farmworkers, were scattered across the Eastern Cape. He agreed to pay costs, believed to be around R60 000, for the delay.It also came to light that Troon had applied for legal aid, as he is now unemployed after he failed to regain his seat in council following the elections last year. His application, however, was turned down.In a statement on Monday, Mali said Troon needed time to gather more evidence against Trollip as more surviving farmworkers had come forward "to tender more evidence on allegations of gross abuse they suffered on Mr Trollip's farm"."The farmworkers are resolute and adamant about their allegations against Trollip. They want to seize the opportunity to testify and expose all their alleged abuse before the judge," said Mali.Trollip is expected to apply for a new court date, but it is unlikely the matter will be heard before next year.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
