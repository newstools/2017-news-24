According to EMS spokesperson Robert Mckenzie, an emergency services helicopter had to land on a steep ridge between Bomela and Gamalakhe where the patient was located. "The patient had been shot and needed to be airlifted due to his condition and the inaccessible area where the incident occurred." Mckenzie said ground crew paramedics had to hike through difficult terrain to get to the patient.
