Many rebels fled to Rwanda and Uganda before a 2013 peace agreement was signed with the government and the group disbanded.But in January DRC's government warned that the former rebels in Uganda were re-grouping and crossing back into the country.Uganda's government said that hundreds of members of the rebel group in January fled a military camp there where they had been awaiting amnesty, and cautioned that many had been quietly infiltrating into the general public.DRC residents said on Thursday they are terrified of the group's return. Eastern DRC has been plagued by many armed rebel groups since the Rwandan genocide in 1994.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
