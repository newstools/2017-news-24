Those who had documentation were informed about services provided through the migrant help desk in the inner city.Some prostitutes declined help, saying they were content with their work and had places where they paid rent.&ldquo;They alleged that they were able to take care of themselves and their families with the income they earn from this trade,&rdquo; Phalatse said.On Monday, Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba said the department and locals needed to agree on what to do. He appealed to residents not to take the law into their own hands.He said he had asked his department&rsquo;s &ldquo;community outreach programme&rdquo; to visit areas populated by immigrants.In Rosettenville, residents followed him around as he visited two of the 10 homes residents set alight on Saturday. They claimed they were being used as brothels and as hideouts for drug lords. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
