Her findings included that he lied about his qualifications.Motsoeneng was removed as chief operating officer (COO) after the Supreme Court of Appeal in September rejected his bid to appeal the Western Cape High Court&rsquo;s November 2015 ruling declaring his appointment irrational and setting it aside.The DA has welcomed the judgment.BREAKING: @Our_DA welcomes today's judgement dismissing the SABC&rsquo;s appeal that #Hlaudi is not fit to hold any position at the SABC.BREAKING. #SABC again loses appeal application over Hlaudi Motsoeneng judgment; High Court says its 'not much impressed' by SABC argument. pic.twitter.com/CkaNCKuQAB&mdash; TVwithThinus (@TVwithThinus) February 7, 2017BREAKING. #SABC again loses appeal application over Hlaudi Motsoeneng judgment; High Court says its 'not much impressed' by SABC argument. pic.twitter.com/CkaNCKuQAB24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
