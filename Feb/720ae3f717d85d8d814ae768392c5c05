However, SAWS warned that the weather system could still cause heavy rainfall and flooding as it heads inland toward South Africa.Mozambique's National Institute of Disaster Management (INGC) had earlier issued an alert over the cyclone threat, advising people to prepare food and urging vulnerable communities to seek shelter.Mozambique, one of the world's poorest countries, is often battered by deadly flooding and storms.In 2000, floods claimed at least 800 lives, and more than 100 were killed in 2015.Scores have already died in the current rainy season, which began in October.The high death toll in 2000 triggered significant donations for resettlement projects and improvements to water management infrastructure, early warning systems and emergency response resources.Watch social media video&nbsp;Situation in Inhambane Mozambique as cyclone #Dineo hits.
