Preshalin Naidoo is expected to testify in his own defence in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday, National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Phindi Louw said. On Tuesday, the court rejected his lawyer’s application for him to be acquitted. The application was made in terms of Section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Act. According to this section the court may, after the prosecution closes its case, find an accused not guilty if it believes there is no evidence that they committed the offence. Naidoo faces two counts of culpable homicide and additional charges of reckless or negligent driving and inconsiderate driving. His VW Polo GTI crashed into Mhere's car on William Nicol Drive, Fourways, in the early hours of January 31 2015. Mhere's father Joseph was a passenger in the car. He survived.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
