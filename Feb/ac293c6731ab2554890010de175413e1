He says things that aren't true. That's the same as lying, I guess."Franken cites Trump's groundless claim that he would have won the popular vote in the presidential race if not for 3 million to 5 million immigrants in the country illegally voting for his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.And Trump is said to have told some senators in a private meeting at the White House that he and former Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte would have won in New Hampshire if not for voters bused in from out of state.Franken is looking at those examples and saying: "You know, that is not the norm for a president of the United States, or, actually, for a human being."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
