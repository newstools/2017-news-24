But Tshisekedi's death two weeks ago has complicated an already strained situation as politicians vie for the top spot."This situation has the potential to undermine the political goodwill that led to the signing of the 31 December agreement," the statement said.They called on the stakeholders "to redouble, in good faith, their efforts towards a speedy conclusion of the ongoing talks."The talks launched by the Roman Catholic church, were intended to ward off violence as Kabila's mandate ended on December 20 with no sign of him stepping down and no election in sight.The four partner organisations said the agreement "is critical in upholding the legitimacy of the transitional institutions until elections." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
