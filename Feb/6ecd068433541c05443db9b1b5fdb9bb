She held the post of Gauteng health MEC previously.Bloom however said she had been mediocre as MEC and did not have the drive to fix the "deeply dysfunctional department".Earlier on Wednesday, Health Ombudsman Malegapuru Makgoba told reporters in Pretoria that Mahlangu had lost credibility and her actions and those of two senior officials were "chaotic, hurried, in a rush and a total shambles".AS IT HAPPENED: Gauteng health MEC quits in wake of patient deaths probe94 deaths uncoveredMakgoba said Mahlangu initially claimed that 36 patients had died. His investigation uncovered that 94 mentally ill patients died between March 23 and December 19, 2016.He suspected the number could be higher. Many families were not informed about the deaths of their relatives.Makgoba said 18 out of 47 transferred patients died at Precious Angels NGO shortly after Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi instructed him to investigate.All 27 NGOs did not have valid licences.Makgoba said this was unlawful, as the victims were vulnerable, and all the NGOs had to face the law, he said.One of the family members broke down during the briefing as Motsoaledi spoke about the reasons for the investigation."I'm not embarrassed," Motsoaledi said. "I'm distressed and very angry. Something like this should have been avoided."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
