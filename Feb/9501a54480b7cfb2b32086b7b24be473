The national flag became a symbol of anti-government protests after Mawarire, a little-known pastor, posted a Facebook video in which he had the flag wound around his neck as he deplored the country's worsening economic crisis."We will not allow the government of this country to keep on oppressing us, intimidating us and incarcerating us for speaking out," Linda Masarira, a rights activist, told reporters outside the court."They have to release Pastor Evan." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
