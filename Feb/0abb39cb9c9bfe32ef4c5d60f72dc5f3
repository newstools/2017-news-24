The municipality in a statement said the roll was open for inspection until March 31. The city said general valuations were done at least every four years in terms of the Municipal Property Rates Act. Previous rolls were released in 2008 and 2012. The municipality's General Valuation Roll contains over half a million property entries, the majority of which fall within the residential rating category. The remaining categories include commercial properties, houses and sectional title units and vacant land. The third General Valuation [GV2017] will come into effect from July 1 to June 30, 2021, the city said. Deputy city manager of finance, Krish Kumar, said property owners should inspect the roll to determine whether the valuation assigned was a correct reflection of the property. He said property owners could lodge objections if they felt that the valuation was either too high or too low. Inspections of properties were undertaken where considered necessary in order to verify information already on hand or where such information was considered incomplete. The municipality has access to a vast database of property information including building plans, Deeds Office data, geographic information systems, aerial photography, information obtained from previous inspections as well as data from property sales in each area. This information is regularly maintained and inspections are routinely carried out where alterations, authorised and unauthorised, are made to properties. The 2017 General Valuation Roll is available on www.durban.gov.za, at Sizakala Centres and at the Real Estate Unit on 75 Dr John Langalibalele Dube (Winder) Street, Durban. Objection forms can be downloaded from the same website and queries can be directed to val.roll@durban.gov.za  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
