We carried out some test and realised that the dog is not infected with rabies," the source said.Barrow returned to The Gambia last week to a jubilant welcome marking the beginning of the west African nation's first democratic transfer of power.He had been living in Senegal for safety reasons since mid-January.Jammeh went into exile in Equatorial Guinea under threat of regional military intervention.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
