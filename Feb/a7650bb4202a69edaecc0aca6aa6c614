"There was no concrete danger of an attack," he told reporters in the western city of Wiesbaden.The suspect arrived in Germany as an asylum-seeker in August 2015, the prosecutors' statement said. He had already lived in the country for a decade some years earlier.He was arrested the following August on an outstanding 2008 conviction for causing bodily harm.After serving a 43-day sentence, he was kept in detention awaiting deportation to Tunisia before the authorities were forced to release him again."As the Tunisian authorities, despite repeated reminders from the German authorities, failed to supply the necessary deportation documents within the 40-day period, the suspect was released on November 4, 2016," the statement said.He was kept under surveillance from the day of his release until his arrest on Wednesday, it added.High alert&nbsp;Germany has been on high alert since the December 19 Christmas market assault, which was claimed by the Islamic State group.The attack fuelled criticism of Germany's security services and of Chancellor Angela Merkel's liberal asylum policy, with opponents saying not enough was done to stop Amri.Merkel, who is up for re-election this year, has since vowed to get tough on deportations and step up pressure on countries to take back nationals whose asylum claims have been rejected, particularly in the Maghreb region.Separately, police in Berlin on Tuesday arrested three suspected jihadists accused of planning to travel to foreign "war zones", likely to be either Iraq or Syria.ISIS claimed responsibility for the Bardo attack, in which two gunmen opened fire at the museum, killing 21 foreign tourists and a police officer.The Ben Guerdane attack saw dozens of heavily armed jihadists cross into the frontier town from Libya to launch coordinated attacks on police and army posts, killing seven civilians and 13 security personnel.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
