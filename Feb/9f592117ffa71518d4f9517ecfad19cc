His aunt Khombisile Nxumalo said the family don t know what to do anymore and have looked everywhere for him. Nkosikhona left at around 9am and we thought he was playing with his friends as usual. He never played far from home. We became worried when he didn t show up in the afternoon. I went around the neighbourhood asking if anyone had seen him. His friends said he told them he was going home after they had finished playing. Nxumalo has been taking care of Nkosikhona since his mother died when he was two. The pain is unbearable especially for his grandmother. She is sick and can t stop asking about him, she said.The short, light-skinned boy was last seen wearing grey shorts and a purple T-shirt.He attends H.S. Ebrahim School in Northdale.Nxumalo described the boy as a shy, kind and quiet child .Missing Child South Africa National case officer Bianca van Assegen said they will not close the case until they find the child. We ask the public to have eyes and ears wide open for any information which might assist, she said, adding they had not lost hope of finding him. Gundi , as he is known to his friends, is the youngest child in his family. He has a 19-year-old brother.The family relies on Nkosikhona s social grant to put food on the table. The saddest part is not knowing if he is alive or if he has eaten, for that matter. No parent should go through what we are experiencing, Nxumalo said. Last week, we went with the police to a farm not far away known as Bhobho. We heard he was seen in the area, but when we arrived there was no sign of him. Life is no longer the same at home. According to Missing Children SA, of the 10 children who disappeared from December 2015 to August 2016 in KZN, nine were found, which gives hope to the Nxumalo family.The Department of Education urged the public to work with police. We have full faith in the police that they will work tirelessly to bring the boy home. We urge the parents not to lose hope, said spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa.Police spokesperson Captain Gay Ebrahim said police have worked around the clock to search for the boy. Our station has carried out numerous visits to hospitals and other places as part of the investigation. The community also came on board and assisted in circulating the missing child on social media.
