	     Groblersdal - Police in Limpopo have arrested two suspected drug lords and shut down a multi-million rand drug laboratory operating in a remote village near Groblersdal. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the suspects had been arrested after the crime intelligence unit discovered the laboratory with equipment, bags of Mandrax powder, and stolen vehicles. He said police had made their move after receiving a tip-off about suspects who were involved in vehicle theft, car hijacking and manufacturing and dealing drugs at Thabakhubedu village in Dennilton. "The information was acted upon and two suspects, aged 26 and 39 respectively, were arrested," he said. Two other suspects had managed to evade arrest and Mojapelo said police were searching for them. Two vehicles - a Ford Meteor and a Nissan NP300 - reported stolen in January 2009 in Thabazimbi were also recovered. "Equipment for the manufacturing of Mandrax tablets and all other equipment have an estimated value of R2m.  "One presser machine, one mixer machine and industrial stoves have been confiscated," said Mojapelo.  &amp;lt;br _moz_dirty="" /&amp;gt; Chemicals used in the manufacturing of Mandrax and five bags containing Mandrax powder were also recovered. The total estimated street value of the Mandrax powder was R10m, said Mojapelo. The suspects would be charged with manufacturing and dealing in drugs, and possession of stolen vehicles.  Mojapelo said the operation had lasted several hours and ended at 04:00 on Wednesday morning.  The suspects would appear in the Moutse Magistrate's Court soon.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
