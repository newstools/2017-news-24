"Information reaching us revealed that some hoodlums are planning to hijack the peaceful protest. As such, we won't allow it to hold in Lagos," Lagos police commissioner Fatai Owoseni told AFP."We know that 2Face does not have the capacity to contain such a crowd and we will not fold our hands and watch while things go out of hand," Owoseni said.In a video posted on his Facebook account Tuesday, 2Face urged Nigerians to come out in a "peaceful and articulate manner" for the march."The need for urgent solutions to the challenges facing Nigerians has become very clear," he said in the video. "Things are not getting better for the majority, we are still where we are, poor and desperate. I will no longer be quiet."
