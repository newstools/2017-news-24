Under the watchful eye of ex-Springbok centre and SuperSport presenter Gcobani Bobo and his fellow coaches, there was nowhere to hide for the 100-odd boys being put through their paces. Nashua Pietermaritzburg invited two schools, Grace College and St Charles, that were paired with Mpophomeni s Asibemunye High School and Mthombo High for an afternoon of fun-filled rugby skills action. The programme uses a unique flat-sided ball, known as the ShadowBall that can be thrown against a wall and caught by the player to improve accuracy. The project aims to improve ball skills at schools across South Africa by 20% that, since the end of 2015, has already benefitted 400 children. More than 36 schools will be visited in total, with each school visited twice, to ensure thorough training and improvement of skills. The Rugby Skills Project is another example of Nashua s support for local sport, from school to provincial level, said JP du Toit, sales director at Nashua Pietermaritzburg. - Supplied24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
