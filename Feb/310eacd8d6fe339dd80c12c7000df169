He did not succeed, apparently."Mysterious human-like objects, believed to be tokoloshis are allegedly having forced sexual intercourse at night with female teachers at Chishuma Primary School in Odzi in a real-life drama whose script reads like folklore plucked from Gothic literature," the Manica Post said. The head of the Zimbabwe National Traditional Healers' Association George Kandiero told the paper: "The solution comes when the people affected find a genuine traditional healer who can cleanse that."The paper is part of Zimpapers, the publishing company that also runs the Herald and the Chronicle. Tokoloshis have been reported before, often in connection with money-making enterprises.&nbsp;In 2014, a Mutare MP was forced to deny publicly that a tokoloshi had been found at his business premises. Three years earlier, the Chronicle said that the demand for tokoloshis (some of them imported from South Africa) was "outstripping supply" in Bulawayo and the eastern city of Mutare.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
