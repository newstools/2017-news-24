The ANC lost control of three key metros and support declined in several provinces.The gathering that brought together more than three thousands former MK members also raised concern over slates, vote buying and the weak state of branches in the political party.Siphiwe Nyanda, a former SANDF chief and MK general, told journalists that they understood that the consultative conference wouldn't necessarily heal all of the ANC's problems.He also said if the dissolution of the NEC wasn't discussed at the conference, it would not be the end of the road."You can find other mechanisms to ensure that the integrity of the process [elective conference] is enhanced by getting other people, even from here [pointing at other former MK leaders] to participate in the preparation of conference and so on and so forth," said Nyanda.The steering committee refused to answer questions regarding its faith in the current leaders of the ANC."We are not here to endorse all those people in the weekend newspapers," said Ka Shabangu, a member of the steering committee.Shabangu said the MK vets were merely trying to lay a foundation from which leaders could be elected.Meeting with MKMVAAnother member, Gregory Nthatisi, said they respected processes and leaders elected in the party and the council would not enter the succession debate currently underway."What we want in the end... there should be no distinction between this intervention committee of council as well as them," Nyanda said, referring to the uMkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA).He confirmed that the council's steering committee met with leaders in the MKMVA on Tuesday and said they would announce a way forward at a joint media briefing on Monday.The council was widely seen as an attempt to weaken chairperson of the MKMVA Kebby Maphatsoe's grip on the organisation.The council expressed concern over the MKMVA's involvement in factional battles in the ANC, its lack of legitimacy and its inability to account for resources and activities in the association."We should speak with one voice, I think there is understanding about that," said Nyanda.WATCH:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
