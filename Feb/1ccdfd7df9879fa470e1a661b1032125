But efforts to avoid all-out conflict in the country of 71 million people appear to have broken down, negotiations between the government and opposition parties having stalled. Francis, 80, also urged prayers for victims of war and violence in other parts of Africa and across the world.He denounced in particular the "cruel terrorist acts" in Pakistan, where at least 88 people were killed on Thursday when an attacker blew himself up inside a crowded Sufi shrine, for which the Islamic State group claimed responsibility. The attack came after a series of bloody assaults, including a Taliban suicide bomb in the eastern city of Lahore which killed 13 people and wounded dozens.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
