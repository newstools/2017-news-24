HILLCREST police are calling on the community to report illegal shebeens in the area so they can be closed. According to Hillcrest SAPS communications officer Constable N. Manqele, these illegal shebeens are contributing to the rising crime levels in Hillcrest and surrounds. “The Hillcrest police are working on a plan to shut down all illegal shebeens and taverns in the community. “Those found trading without a permit will be fined and the business will be closed down.” Manqele is appealing to the community to work with them to eradicate this problem. Molweni resident Patricia Ndlovu, said she was only 14 when she had her first taste of alcohol and it almost destroyed her life. “I was in Standard 7 and my friends and I decided to bunk school and buy a bottle of brandy from a local shebeen. They did not even ask our age, and served us. “We bought some coke and a packet of chips and sat at the back of the shebeen and drank the alcohol. I was so drunk I could not even stand. A group of boys also joined us, and after a while they made passes at us.” Ndlovu said that the guys did not take no for an answer and one of them tried to kiss her. “I managed to fight him off, and grabbed my friend’s hand and we ran home.” She said she will never forget that day as it was the first and last time she consumed alcohol, and it was the day she almost got raped. “It was a wake-up call for me and I will never wish that on anyone. I, now as an adult, make it my duty now to educate children about the harm alcohol can do, and I also report illegal shebeens so they are closed down.” The community can report illegal shebeens to the Hillcrest SAPS on 031 765 9100.
