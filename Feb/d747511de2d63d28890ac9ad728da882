The employees' allegations were later confirmed during an inspection by the department's inspectors, who found that the company had contravened the Basic Conditions of Employment Act [BCEA], Mkamba said. He said the department escalated the matter to the Labour Court after inspectors issued a compliance order to the company, requesting that it pay its employees, but the employer failed to adhere to the compliance order.Mkamba said earlier this month that Judge David Gush had ordered the company to pay a R22&nbsp;209.36 fine to the department and R88&nbsp;837.44 for underpayment.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
