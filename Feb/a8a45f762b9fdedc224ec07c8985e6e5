The money was also deducted to recover the costs of damage caused to the car when her son crashed it in 2012.In an interview with The Citizen last week, Madonsela said she had been given a letter by SAPS VIP Protection to continue using the car. She also told the paper that Mkhwebane had not objected to this, or request that the car be returned.Madonsela told The Citizen that the Auditor General's office had found she would not be held liable for the damages because she had not given her son permission to drive the car.Meanwhile, current Public Protector Mkhwebane told journalists at a briefing to mark her 100 days in office last week that she was still seeking legal advice on the matter.The Auditor General's office said on Wednesday that an audit query was raised regarding the matter."At no stage did the AGSA perform an investigation into the circumstances around the accident," said Khutsafalo Mnisi in a statement.She said it was not the role of the Auditor General's office to conduct investigations into the culpability of officials. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
