This is false. We have documentary proof that not only was he informed about it, but his own signature is in the document asking his PA to schedule a meeting regarding the case and that's as early as June 2016."It just was not true that he didn't know about the case, McBride said."Unfortunately for Phahlane, we have recordings of every interview."IPID chief of investigations Matthews Sesoko told the committee that the watchdog was not saying that Phahlane was guilty."That's not our role. Our role is to investigate and present evidence. What we are saying is that what we have, based on investigations relating to the vehicles, the house, it just doesn't add up and therefore it requires us to investigate that."Once the investigation was complete, the results would be presented to the relevant authority to decide whether or not to proceed, he said.Whistleblowers victimised"We are saying what we have so far suggests there is some wrongdoing that at least needs an investigation," he said.A confident McBride was grilled on whether he had any political support in IPID, and whether he had informed Minister Nathi Nhleko and President Jacob Zuma about the situation involving Phahlane.McBride told the committee that it was difficult to envisage that the minister would take their recommendations seriously."At the moment when we send our recommendations to him, they get sent back from the minister. But we will continue to do the right thing, and try and brief the minister on a range of issues."McBride told the committee that there was also a pattern of whistleblowers and witnesses being threatened and victimised.Last year, Nhleko asked Parliament to institute a disciplinary process against McBride but that failed.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
