READ: This is police chief's controversial house This and more would be the focus of the meeting on Thursday, police committee chairperson Francois Beukman said on Wednesday. Over the recess period, there had much media scrutiny of the police. “Therefore we felt it appropriate that the minister must come and brief us on these matters. It is important that there is leadership in the police to foster public trust,” Beukman said. If issues such as the report on Hawks head Berning Ntlemeza’s “illegal appointment” arose at the meeting, they would be dealt with. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) had not been invited to attend the meeting as it would brief the committee on its investigations separately, Beukman said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
