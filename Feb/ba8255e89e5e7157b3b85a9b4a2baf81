	     Pretoria – The final figure of the number of people injured when two passenger trains heading in opposite directions collided head-on at the Rosslyn station during peak hour on Monday evening is currently at 216, Metrorail said on Tuesday. Metrorail spokesperson Lillian Mofokeng said 177 commuters were walk-ins, while 38 of the total number were treated for minor to moderate injuries. One commuter is in a serious, but not critical, condition. The driver of one of the trains is also in a critical condition. The injured commuters were taken to Kgabo Clinic, Odi Hospital, Dr George Mukhari Hospital, Kalafong Hospital, Tshwane District Hospital and Akasia Hospital. Mofokeng said the train service for Ga-Rankuwa commuters has been restored. De Wildt trains are using a single line between Rosslyn and De Wildt stations. Train delays of approximately 40 minutes can be expected in that corridor. "A board of inquiry will be instituted to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the cause of the accident and circumstances around it in order to prevent future occurrences," Mofokeng said.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
