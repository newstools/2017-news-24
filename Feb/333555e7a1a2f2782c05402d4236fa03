Christians overwhelmingly supported the army chief-turned-president, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, and extremists have used such support as a pretext to increase attacks against them.The video shows footage of Abu Abdullah al-Masri, the militant who blew himself up at the central Cairo church in December. The attack, says the narrator, was "only the beginning.""Oh worshippers of the cross ... the soldiers of the state are watching you," another masked militant identified as Abu Zubair al-Masri says.The video carries the logo "Egypt" instead of the normal "Wilayat Sinai" or the state of Sinai. Wilayat Sinai, the name of the ISIS branch in Sinai, has claimed responsibility for dozens of suicide bombings and attacks, mainly targeting security forces and military across the country but primarily in Sinai Peninsula, where the army has been leading an anti-terrorism operation for years.The ISIS message comes at a time when attacks on Coptic Christians have escalated in Sinai. In the past month, at least three Christians were gunned down in separate drive-by shooting attacks in the city of el-Arish.Al-Sisi has repeatedly assured Egypt's Christians of his goodwill toward the community, visiting the seat of the Coptic Orthodox church in Cairo on major holidays, but many in the ancient community complain that very little has changed in their lives since al-Sisi took office in 2014, especially in rural areas where Muslim radicals frequently attack Christian homes and businesses over a range of issues, including the construction or restoration of churches, land disputes or sexual affairs between members of each community.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
