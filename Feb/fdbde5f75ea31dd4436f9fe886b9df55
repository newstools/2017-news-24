He said Khartoum was convinced that Jasek "had no intention to undermine" Sudan.Release International, a group which says its mission is to help persecuted Christians worldwide, said Jasek and three Sudanese men were detained after helping to finance the medical treatment of a student from the conflict-hit region of Darfur who had suffered burns during a rally.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
