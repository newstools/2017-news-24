This was in reaction to a Public Protector report that Absa had benefitted from an unlawful apartheid-era bailout when it bought Bankorp in 1992. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane recommended in the leaked preliminary report that Absa repay R2.25bn.The ANCYL wanted legislation that would enable the establishment of a state-owned bank to be finalised before the end of the year.Nzuza said Gordhan was not the only person who deserved the chop. A complete overhaul of Treasury was needed. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
