They would only be allowed to move between them under escort.Accredited journalists had been free to move around in all areas of the precinct during past SONAs.Tsenoli said he was not aware of the concept of the "media squares"."Parliament is ultimately responsible for the security at SONA. In my view, there should be no clampdown on media freedom on the day."Tsenoli said it would be an unrealistic strategy to block communication in an age of cellphones and social media, and at an event attended by many political parties."Really, would we be able to do that? [It would be] like putting your fingers to try and plug holes?"That is how ridiculous it sounds. It would be clumsy."He said journalists in the&nbsp;National Assembly&nbsp;will be able to leave the bay were there to be news breaking elsewhere on the precinct.Red zone, SSAThe deputy speaker was coy on whether he had been filled in on Parliament's plans, and said the process of running SONA was done primarily through Parliament, but with many other stakeholders, including the police and the City of Cape Town.He was also not aware of the signed&nbsp;memorandum from Mgidlana, dated January 25, to Parliament staff and others, informing it of the "media square" outside the National Assembly.Journalists asked why Parliament had ramped up the size of the city's red zone this year, with more road closures, the introduction of the "media squares", and the vetting of guests by the State Security Agency.Tsenoli said the security processes were determined by Parliament, in conjunction with the City and the police."Those determinations are done by people who manage the crowds outside Parliament, and the potential that they may have on what is happening inside Parliament."The risks are determined by what may have happened in the past."He reassured journalists that their freedom would not be interfered with, and promised to get it in writing that Parliament would not interfere with the work of the media through the "squares".*This story has been updated.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
