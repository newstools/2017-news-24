In South Africa, we protest about many things, but today we&rsquo;re here as citizens who realise that our people died at the hands of a government which doesn&rsquo;t care," said Maimane.Maimane said they will hold the ANC government accountable through a motion of 'no confidence' on Makhura&rsquo;s leadership, which was being debated in the legislature on Tuesday.The party also called for a judicial inquiry into all the deaths of the patients."There must be an inquest for each and every person who died," said Maimane.DA public relations councillor, Thamsanqa Mabhena, said they don&rsquo;t want a "general report of what happened, but an inquest looking at all the deaths case by case".Maimane said the ANC should force Makhura to resign, or the masses must rise up."As Nelson Mandela said, if the ANC government does to you what the apartheid government did, then you must do to it what you did to the apartheid government," he said.#Eaidimeni DA representatives about to address the crowd. @News24 pic.twitter.com/m6ZDR8FObe&mdash; Sisa Canca (@squire208) February 28, 2017#Eaidimeni DA representatives about to address the crowd. @News24 pic.twitter.com/m6ZDR8FObe"There must be an inquest for each and every one who died" Maimane #Esidimeni @News24&mdash; Sisa Canca (@squire208) February 28, 2017"There must be an inquest for each and every one who died" Maimane #Esidimeni @News24You knew, Honourable Premier, now do the honourable thing and resign! - @MmusiMaimanehttps://t.co/S8uSmxXZ3c #JusticeForEsidimeni pic.twitter.com/BNVDAplB9U&mdash; Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) February 28, 2017You knew, Honourable Premier, now do the honourable thing and resign! - @MmusiMaimanehttps://t.co/S8uSmxXZ3c #JusticeForEsidimeni pic.twitter.com/BNVDAplB9UMs Rashida Landis is the mother of one of the victims of the uncaring Gauteng Health Department. #JusticeForEsidimeni pic.twitter.com/tvkqyGwCmj&mdash; Mmusi Maimane (@MmusiMaimane) February 28, 2017Ms Rashida Landis is the mother of one of the victims of the uncaring Gauteng Health Department. #JusticeForEsidimeni pic.twitter.com/tvkqyGwCmjDA Shadow MEC of Health, @JackBloomDA, first raised this matter in 2015, and was ignored. #JusticeForEsidimeni pic.twitter.com/wfkVCNLDAQ&mdash; Mmusi Maimane (@MmusiMaimane) February 28, 2017DA Shadow MEC of Health, @JackBloomDA, first raised this matter in 2015, and was ignored. #JusticeForEsidimeni pic.twitter.com/wfkVCNLDAQ24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
