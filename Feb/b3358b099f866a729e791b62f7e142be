Our people in the informal sector do not want to be taxed. When a black person takes over a business, they do not want to pay taxes," Chinamasa was cited as saying.But the MPs hit back at him, with the Norton MP Temba Mliswa saying piecemeal approaches would not give government the financial liberties it needed."People are suffering; we are being insensitive to their plight by not providing solutions. Government has a tendency or working up to introduce a tax, you must ask yourself where the money is coming from if you are failing to do it yourself," Mliswa was quoted as saying.The government reportedly introduced a 15% VAT on meat recently.The MPs said government officials needed to trim their lifestyle budget and "redirect the funds to social services like what Tanzanian President John Magufuli has done".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
