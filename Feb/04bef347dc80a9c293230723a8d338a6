On Monday she held a provincial executive committee in Bindura, the provincial capital of Mashonaland Central - her perceived stronghold where she has been a legislator for more than two decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;Delicate negotiations&nbsp;Mujuru was scheduled to visit other remaining provinces in the coming days, said ZPF spokesperson Jealous Mawarire, adding that his boss was unfazed by the &ldquo;hullabaloo&rdquo; within her party.&ldquo;The President (Mujuru) is seized with (PEC) Provincial Executive Committee meetings. She will not do face-no-face interviews,&rdquo; Mawarire told News24 on Tuesday.He shrugged off fears Mugabe&rsquo;s former deputy&rsquo;s party formed last March faced imminent collapse.&ldquo;We can only get stronger and more focused. The party was neither Gumbo nor Mutasa so their expulsion doesn&rsquo;t signify its collapse,&rdquo; he said. But critics were adamant Mujuru and her party risked being considered as junior partners in on-going negotiations to form a coalition of opposition forces.ZPF is currently engaged in delicate negotiations with the main opposition MDC-T and other opposition political parties to forge a so-called grand alliance to wrestle power from President Robert Mugabe in next year&rsquo;s polls.Political differences&nbsp;According to Rita Makarau, the chairperson of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, the body charged with holding elections in the country, were tentatively set for July 2018. The critics maintained that Mujuru&rsquo;s political standing has been &ldquo;dented&rdquo;. Political analyst, Vivid Gwede, said that Mujuru&rsquo;s former close associates have put a damper on her pedigree. &ldquo;Since she has an eye on the coalition, it is like now ex-lovers pooh-poohing a fianc&eacute;e at a wedding&hellip; she can't lead the coalition now although she remains and important player,&rdquo; said Gwede. Political analyst Ricky Mukonza concurred, adding:&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no doubt this will negatively affect the morale of its supporters and will discourage new members from joining, however, this development reflects on how as Zimbabweans we are unable to resolve political differences without causing a split.&rdquo; Mawarire however chipped in: &ldquo;Critics will always find something to say but the talks and our convention will proceed. We are stronger and wiser without those fellows.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
