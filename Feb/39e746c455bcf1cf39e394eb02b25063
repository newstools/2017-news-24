Jammeh is accused by Gambians of land grabs and taking over businesses for his personal gain, while new Interior Minister Mai Fatty alleged last month the ex-president took $11m from state coffers before heading for exile in Equatorial Guinea.Meanwhile Foreign Minister Ousainou Darboe said human rights concerns would be "speedily addressed" by the new administration, and that the process of rejoining the International Criminal Court would soon begin.The Gambia notified the United Nations in November it would withdraw from the legal body on Jammeh's orders.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
