Tens of thousands have died in the conflict, despite a 12 000-man UN peacekeeping force posted in the area, while over three million have been displaced.Cirillo accused Kiir and his entourage of turning the country's military into a Dinka "tribal" army that has taken part "in systematic killings of people, rape of women and the burning of villages in the name of pursuing rebels in peaceful villages".Cirillo is from the southern Equatoria region surrounding capital Juba that escaped violence in the beginning of the civil war.Fighting had largely been restricted to the northern states of Unity, Upper Nile and Jonglei until war broke out in Juba last July.In the past six months, it has expanded into Equatoria, where ethnic killings intensified, particularly in and around the southern town of Yei, prompting tens of thousands of people to seek refuge in neighbouring Uganda.Dinka troops were accused of driving the atrocities, which drew the attention of the international community.It led UN experts in early December to report "ethnic cleansing" in several parts of South Sudan."Soldiers from the Dinka ethnic group have been strategically deployed and posted in non-Dinka areas to support the policy of land occupation," Cirillo said.They "have appropriated to themselves other people's properties" and "deliberately neglected and left without deployment," he added.This week, Festus Mogae, a former president of Botswana who leads the Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (JMEC), reported that new militia groups have emerged in the conflict and expressed fears of renewed ethnic violence.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
