We have no other leader, like Tshitshi, who can fight without the need for guns. How could he die in Belgium?" asked UDPS activist, Yves, using Tshisekedi's nickname.The power-sharing deal, brokered by the country's influential Roman Catholic bishops, allows Kabila to stay in office until late 2017 in tandem with a transitional body and a new premier, yet to be agreed.Before his death, the UDPS said Tshisekedi would return to DRC soon to "take up his historic responsibilities" but there had been great concern for "the Old Man", as he was affectionately knownVoters in DR Congo were originally to have chosen a new president in 2016, but the authorities said the electoral registers must be revised, a huge enterprise in a country almost the size of western Europe.And in a highly controversial ruling, the constitutional court said Kabila could remain in office until an election was held.The ruling fed opposition fears that he planned to amend the constitution to allow him to run for a third term.Kabila, 45, has been in power, in one of the least developed countries in the world, since the 2001 assassination of his father Laurent at the height of the Second DRC War.Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders described Tshisekedi as a "remarkable political figure".His "last fight (...) for the constitution and democracy culminated in the New Year's Eve agreement," Reynders said in a statement, adding that "Belgium joins forces with the Congolese people in their grief and their desire to see his work bear fruit".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
