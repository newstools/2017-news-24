The only time that may happen is when there is a threat to life and property, that is of such a nature that the South African Police cannot handle. Their deployment in this regard will be at the request of the South African Police Services. In turn the SAPS can only act at the behest of the Presiding Officers, except in instances where there is a total breakdown of law and order that threatens life and property. - Statement from Parliament Upon the request of the South African Police Services, the South African National Defence Force is sometimes deployed to support the police in exercising their safety and security function, such as the case in point. &nbsp; When such a request has been made and the President of the Republic has issued a declaratory order, it is procedural that the President advises the Speaker of the National Assembly (NA) and the Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), as has occurred. - Parliamentary statement #ANCWL #SONA2017 Dlamini:People must not say we are side dishes of people when we have taken a decision.STMSAPS and Parliament s security, and not the SANDF, will provide safety and security at the opening of Parliament, the government said on Wednesday.It made the assurance following an uproar over the deployment of 441 SA National Defence Force members to the State of the Nation Address on Thursday.
