Talks with Namibia's government were continuing on the issue.In Tanzania, German forces were accused of crimes including forced starvations following the tribal revolt known as Maji Maji.If Tanzania's government presses for reparations, the East African country would be following the recent example of neighbouring Kenya, where a group of elderly Kenyans won compensation from the British government for acts of torture blamed on British colonial officials.In 2013, the British government said it "sincerely regrets" the acts of torture carried out against Kenyans fighting for liberation from colonial rule in the 1950s and 1960s. It also paid about $21.5m to the 5 200 Kenyans who were found to have been tortured, or about $4 100 per Kenyan victim.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
