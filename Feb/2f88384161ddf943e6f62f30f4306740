Those accused have denied any role in the attempted coup. While the government is officially boycotting the talks, a top official from the ruling CNDD-FDD is among the delegations, but has refused to sit at the same table as CNARED.The talks got under way on Friday morning, and Mkapa is hoping they will lead to an agreement "on the principle and spirit of the Arusha peace accords" credited with ending a 12-year civil war in 2006.Peace and stability&nbsp;He also wants consensus that Burundi's constitution will not undergo revision "until the situation has stabilised".The Burundi government launched such a reform process on Wednesday that members of civil society and government fear could lift provisions on term limits and allow Nkurunziza to seek a fourth term in 2020.CNARED's executive secretary Anicet Niyonkuru said the request for the party's officials to be arrested did not come as a surprise."The regime has once again shown its refusal to see peace and stability return to Burundi, but we are not worried as we got assurances from the Tanzanian government before coming here."Nkurunziza's third-term run and victory plunged the central African nation into turmoil, with hundreds killed in ensuing unrest. Nearly 400,000 have fled the country.A September report by UN rights experts recounted spine-chilling cases of torture and horrific sexual violence, mass arrests and disappearances and warned that "the crime of genocide also looms large".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
