While technological changes enable more people to engage in acts of journalism, those same changes bring new risks, such as surveillance and tracking."Some major big news organisations have taken steps to increase safety, but freelancers and local journalists often lack resources and training, according to the report.In the wake of kidnappings, a number of international news organisations agreed to a set of principles which call for treating freelancers as they would staff, the report noted. But because the guidelines are voluntary, not all organisations follow them.Some positive signs have emerged, including a greater awareness of the threats and better co-operation among members of the media, it added."I think the networks are stronger now than they were 10 years ago, and even stronger than five years ago," Judith Matloff, a journalist and media safety instructor at the Columbia University School of Journalism, said in the report."People are working together more and I think that's absolutely critical."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
