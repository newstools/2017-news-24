The countries share a border on the shallow, freshwater lake. Boko Haram, which has since 2009 fought to impose its own brand of hardline Islam on northeast Nigeria, has in recent years launched deadly raids and suicide bombings in all four countries.Vital resourceLake Chad, which is believed to have once been an inland sea, is a vital source of water and fishing for those who live in and around its shores in the remote, semi-arid region.But the conflict, which according to some estimates has killed at least 20 000 people and made more than 2.6 million others homeless, has exacerbated an already difficult situation.&nbsp;Complex problem&nbsp;The Lake Chad region has long been one of the most impoverished and under-developed places in the world, with poor human development indicators in areas such as education and healthcare.Rapid population growth, the effects of climate change - the shrinking of the lake and the creep of the Sahara desert - and the violence has created what aid agencies call an "acute crisis".Huge numbers&nbsp;Some 17 million people live in the most affected areas. Violence has hit fishing and farming, and forced hundreds of thousands to live in camps or with friends and relatives. The UN says 10.7 million people are currently in need in the region; 7.1 million are "severely food insecure"; and there are "famine-like conditions" in Borno state, northeast Nigeria.Aid money&nbsp;If funding is met at the Oslo conference, the money will go towards life-saving food distribution and providing clean water, medicine, shelter and education to help rebuild lives.If the money is not found, the UN and other agencies have made dire predictions, including that as many as 75 000 of the 515 000 children with severe acute malnutrition could die.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
