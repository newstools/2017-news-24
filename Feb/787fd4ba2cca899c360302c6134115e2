With the low usage levels during the week, it is impractical to keep these pools open while facing the current water crisis in Cape Town."He acknowledged that the situation was not ideal."But I trust the public can appreciate the severity of the situation and will support this measure, over and above their individual water-saving efforts. We need to look at the bigger picture and, frankly, a short-term sacrifice like this is a small price to pay if we consider the impact it will have on our longer-term water supply and needs," Smith said.* The Newlands, Westridge and Trafalgar pools would be closed for the rest of the summer season due to upgrades and repairs.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
