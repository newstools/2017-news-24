Lynn.Hitchcock A LIGHTNING strike in Wartburg last Thursday killed one and injured four. The group, who were on their way to a local supermarket took shelter under a tree.  Then as the storm worsened Spmandandla Zakwe dashed into the supermarket and looking back saw the others lying on the ground. He saw that Mthokozi Buthelezi was not moving and realised he had been struck by lightning.  ER24 paramedics, who were quickly on the scene, declared Buthelezi dead and said he had sustained numerous injuries. There have been a number of severe thunder and lightning storms in the area. To be safe from lightning do not stand under isolated trees, near water, on high exposed places or next to a metal fence.  The most safe place to be is in an enclosed building or a vehicleÂ­ with the windows closed.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
