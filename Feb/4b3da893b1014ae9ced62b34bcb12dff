This issue has been happening since last year. We need this to be resolved now."Authorities at DUT where students marched on the Vice Chancellor's office to demand better housing @News24 pic.twitter.com/X4g3g5aVKi&mdash; Kaveel Singh (@kaveels) February 6, 2017Authorities at DUT where students marched on the Vice Chancellor's office to demand better housing @News24 pic.twitter.com/X4g3g5aVKi24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
