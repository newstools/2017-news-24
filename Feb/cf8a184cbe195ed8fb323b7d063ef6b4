The dispute was triggered when angry crowds attacked Saudi diplomatic missions to protest the kingdom's execution of a prominent Shiite cleric.Al-Bashir depends heavily on Saudi financial aid and has contributed jets and troops to the Saudi-led military coalition battling Shiite rebels in Yemen. The charges against the autocratic ruler stem from reported atrocities in the conflict in Darfur, in which 300 000 people were killed and 2 million displaced.On Egypt, al-Bashir has had fluctuating relations with the country's army chief-turned-president Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi. He said that the disputed Halayeb Triangle on the Red Sea coast is Sudanese land which the Egyptians occupied in 1990."If they insist there are no negotiations, we will be forced to seek the Security Council track," he said. He also accused Egyptian intelligence of providing shelter to Sudanese government opponents.Al-Bashir told the network that he will not run in the 2020 presidential elections. The 73-year-old underwent a heart procedure last month and has reneged on previous promises not to run in earlier presidential elections.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
