It's not clear how many whites are back working on the land as managers, though News24 has heard of a number of cases. Around 300 whites particularly dairy farm owners, still own their farms though in many cases they have been forced to downsize.With foreign direct investment at a low in Zimbabwe, the president also hit out at some blacks who he said waited for whites to invest "and then they go and work for" them.Said the longtime Zimbabwe leader, whose birthday party will be held on Saturday: "Have we become the masters of our own economy or are we still, you know, thinking of whites as the best entrepreneurs and Africans as the labourers?"He added: "Of course the whites would be happy to see us continue to work for them."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
