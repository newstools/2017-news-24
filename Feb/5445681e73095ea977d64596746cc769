WATCHCape Town - The &nbsp;Progressive Professionals Forum, headed up by Jimmy Manyi, received sponsorships of R840 000, more than half of this from Eskom, as part of a "dirty war" against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, DA finance spokesperson David Maynier said on Tuesday.In a statement, Maynier said that Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown had on Tuesday revealed two "sponsorships" received by the forum headed by Manyi."Replying to a parliamentary question, the minister revealed that the Progressive Professionals Forum received a staggering R440 000 in 'sponsorships' from Eskom, and R400 000 in 'sponsorships' from Transnet," Maynier&rsquo;s statement said."What this reveals is that Brian Molefe, who headed up Eskom at the time the 'sponsorships' were made, was effectively funding an organisation which was waging a 'dirty war' on the Minister of Finance, Pravin Gordhan, and National Treasury, as they probed suspicious contracts entered into by Eskom.&rdquo;Maynier said Manyi and the Progressive Professionals Forum should not have received any "sponsorships" from any South African state-owned enterprises."I will, therefore, request the Auditor-General, Kimi Makwetu, to investigate the 'sponsorships' by state-owned enterprises, including Eskom and Transnet, to the Progressive Professionals Forum," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
