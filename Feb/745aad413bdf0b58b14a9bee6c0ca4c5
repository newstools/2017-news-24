Such attacks on health workers and government property should be condemned by all as they could result in paramedics refusing to go to certain areas."Dhlomo urged the community to protect paramedics, healthcare professionals and all other state workers and property."If the public could be more alert and be the eyes and ears of the police and hand over to the police any information that they might have on incidents of crime that are being planned, or those that have occurred, we can then begin to arrest this troublesome trend."Dhlomo also warned against vigilantism.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
