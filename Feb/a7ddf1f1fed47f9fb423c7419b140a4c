Phahlane said he had hired the director separately as an interior designer.&nbsp;'Allegations of tender irregularities'The letter sent to Phahlane in March 2016 informs him that a complaint had been received against him."Kindly be informed that we have received a complaint from Mr Paul O&rsquo;Sullivan regarding allegations of tender irregularities and irregular appointments," the letter said.&nbsp;"The IPID in Gauteng has been tasked to conduct investigations regarding the above cases."The letter then asks that Phahlane arrange a suitable date for IPID investigators to meet with him to discuss the allegations.At the bottom of the letter is a signature which appears to be Phahlane&rsquo;s and a handwritten note to someone called Heleen, which News24 understands is Heleen Beukes, Phahlane&rsquo;s personal assistant."Hi Heleen. Yes, schedule accordingly", it appears Phahlane had written at the bottom of the letter.There is then an email exchange where a meeting was set up between IPID and Phahlane&nbsp;on June 28, 2016, at 10:00 to discuss the allegations.'Sensation and hullabaloo'Phahlane told Parliament on Wednesday that IPID needed to investigate their case against him and stop making a "sensation and hullabaloo in the media".He denied that he had misled Parliament."At no point would I come here to mislead Parliament about when I was officially informed of the investigation. Anyone who has different facts must prove it. The facts are clear. On the day I was approached by the IPID people in my office, is the day I found out," Phahlane insisted.He said he had been given numerous dates when he was supposed to have found out about the investigation, including January, March and June."Which date is correct?" he asked. "If anyone has facts proving the opposite they must come forward."Phahlane also said that, with regards to the proof of payment for the sound system, it was IPID that needed to do their investigations, and not him. He said there was an invoice from the music shop which showed from which bank account the payment was made."It was not cash. It was an EFT. Those competent at investigations would track which account was reflected on the invoice," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
