The situation is the worst hunger catastrophe since fighting erupted more than three years ago," said the statement signed by the World Food Programme (WFP), UN children's agency Unicef and the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO).South Sudan, the world's youngest nation, was engulfed by civil war in 2013 after President Salva Kiir accused his rival and former deputy Riek Machar of plotting a coup against him.An August 2015 peace deal was left in tatters when fighting broke out in Juba in July last year.Violence - initially between ethnic Dinka supporters of Kiir and ethnic Nuer supporters of Machar - has since spread to other parts of the country, engulfing other ethnic groups and grievances.The United Nations has warned of potential genocide and ethnic cleansing, and there is no prospect of peace in sight.&nbsp;Humanitarians under attack&nbsp;Unity State, a traditional Nuer homeland and birthplace of Machar, has been one of the flashpoints in the conflict. "The convergence of evidence shows that the long term effects of the conflict coupled with high food prices, economic crisis, low agricultural production and depleted livelihood options" have resulted in 4.9 million people going hungry, Aruai said.That figure represents 42% of the country's population.The famine classification is according to an internationally recognised sliding scale of hunger in which an extreme lack of food has lead to starvation and death."The main tragedy of the report that has been launched today... is that the problem is man-made," said Eugene Owusu, the United Nation's Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan."The underlining drivers have been there for some time and we have all known that we have a major food crisis."He said conflict and insecurity for humanitarian workers, who had suffered attacks while carrying out their work, and the looting of "humanitarian assets" had exacerbated the crisis."I would like to use this opportunity to call on the government, the warring parties and all actors to support humanitarians to provide the necessary access so we can continue to bring lifesaving services to those in need," he said.Agriculture disrupted&nbsp;According to the joint press statement, the number of people facing hunger is expected to rise to 5.5 million at the height of the lean season in July if nothing is done to curb the spread of the food crisis."Many families have exhausted every means they have to survive," said FAO Representative in South Sudan Serge Tissot. "The people are predominantly farmers and war has disrupted agriculture. They've lost their livestock, even their farming tools. For months there has been a total reliance on whatever plants they can find and fish they can catch."While the famine in South Sudan is man-made, millions more across the Horn of Africa are going hungry due to a devastating drought following two failed rainy seasons.Famine early warning system FEWSNET has warned that if 2017 rains were again poor in Somalia - as forecast - "famine would be expected."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
