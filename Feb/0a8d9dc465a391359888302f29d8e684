She said that on December 17, 2016, her infuriated husband stormed out of their matrimonial home to attack a client she had brought home for sex."We've always survived on prostitution money. He may have overreacted because I brought a client home. I usually find other places to have sex but on this day I had nowhere else to go," Banda was quoted as saying.&nbsp;She claimed that Moyo struck her client Shedreck Sithole repeatedly on the head with a stone.In his defence, Moyo, however, told the court that he failed to "stomach the level of disrespect displayed by his wife" when he saw the two having sex in a car in front of their home.An emotional Moyo pleaded not guilty to a charge of attempted murder, saying he that he acted out of anger.&nbsp;This came just less than two weeks after a Zimbabwean woman, 48, reportedly tried to kill herself after learning that her eldest son wanted to marry a sex worker.Police said that Nomathamba Moyo drank rat poison following a heated argument with her eldest son Jonathan Ngwenya, 22, who wanted to marry Caroline Munetsi who was said to be a prostitute.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
