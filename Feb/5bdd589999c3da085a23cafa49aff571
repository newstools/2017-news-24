However, the government has since told the ICC that it will pull out, and took the Pretoria judgment on appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeals (SCA), but lost.Speaking after opening the case at a police station in Buitenkant Street, Cape Town, Maimane slammed the South African government's handling of the controversy."We hold the view that nobody can be able to assist a criminal to leave South Africa. It is a departure from human rights and a betrayal of Africans who lost their lives," said Maimane."They cited in their document submitted to the SCA that it was a collective Cabinet decision, and we feel that we can't sit back and let government let criminals escape."The DA is also opposed to South Africa leaving the ICC."Because in future, you may find that South Africans will need protection."WATCH:&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
