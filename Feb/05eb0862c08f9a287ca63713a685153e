This includes that there was sufficient evidence of a romantic relationship between him and Phendla.City Press apologises for the unnecessary damage these reports, statements and omissions have done to Mbati&rsquo;s dignity and the university&rsquo;s reputation.The Office of the Press Ombudsman and a panel of adjudicators also reprimanded City Press for not asking Mbati and the university for comment on statements that Phendla had been hounded out of her job on trumped-up charges; for largely failing to verify Phendla&rsquo;s version of events; and for not capturing Univen&rsquo;s response to the effect that charges were brought against Phendla only after she had brought a charge of sexual harassment against Mbati.Other complaints, such as the reference in the opinion piece that Phendla had been vindicated by the court; the reporting that the Commission for Gender Equality&rsquo;s report was &ldquo;scathing&rdquo; on Mbati; that the court enforced the Commission for Gender Equality&rsquo;s recommendation to be implemented; and that Univen did not comply with the court order, were all dismissed.Visit presscouncil.org.za for the full finding24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
