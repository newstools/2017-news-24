And in a report this week, the Somali anti-corruption NGO Marqaati said civil servants had gone unpaid so the government could pay for lobbying during the elections. In his time as prime minister, Farmajo also established an anti-corruption commission, prohibited unnecessary trips abroad by members of government and put in place an audit of government property and vehicles.Forced out&nbsp;In 2011, after months of political infighting over the holding of presidential elections, a deal was struck to postpone the vote in exchange for Farmajo's resignation.He agreed to step down in "the interest of the Somali people and the current situation in Somalia".In early 2012 Farmajo and members of his former cabinet set up the Tayo ("Quality") political party.On his Facebook page, he says that the party's priority was "encouraging the repatriation of Somali diasporans so as to assist in the post-conflict reconstruction process."Farmajo was born in Mogadishu to activist parents from the southern Gedo region.He has lived off and on for years in the United States, where he studied history and political science. He worked at the foreign ministry before the overthrow of Siad Barre's regime in 1991 ushered in decades of anarchy. He also worked at the Somali embassy in Washington.Before being appointed prime minister he spent several years working in New York for the Buffalo Municipal Housing Authority and the Erie County Division of Equal Employment Opportunity, as well as the New York State Department of Transportation.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
