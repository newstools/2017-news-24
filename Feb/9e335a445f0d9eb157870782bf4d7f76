It also added that there would be no harm suffered by members of the EFF or any other member of the legislature if they are appropriately dressed, Bukula said."The legislature reiterates that its standing rules and orders as well as policies are valid and binding as they are a product of thorough consultative processes in multi-party structures where minority parties are also represented."The EFF could not be reached for comment. &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
