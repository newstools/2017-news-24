The footage shows uniformed soldiers firing repeatedly while advancing on foot along a dirt road, then inspecting a number of bodies.The statement said two days of fighting in December between the army and the Kamwina Nsapu militia left at least 13 dead. It said the military operations were meant to protect some one million people in and around Mbuji-Mayi city.On Tuesday, the UN said the reports of killings this month of members of the same militia in Kasai-Central province, if confirmed, "would suggest excessive and disproportionate use of force by the soldiers."Provincial Governor Alex Kande dismissed the reported death toll of more than 100 in that fighting, and Congolese government spokesperson Lambert Mende called the UN comments "hasty and improper."The militia fighters are accused of destroying buildings and carrying out other acts of violence since their leader Kamwina Nsapu was killed in a police operation last August.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
