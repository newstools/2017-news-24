The state assembly passed the authorisation to put the water and sewerage company, known as Cedae, up for sale by 41 to 28 votes. For Rio, which six months after hosting the Olympics is unable even to pay public salaries fully, the sale is a condition of receiving a federal loan of about $1.13bn. The state and city of Rio, which splurged on now mostly unused stadiums and costly transport improvements before the Olympics, are all but bankrupt. The crisis, which has seen hospitals run out of equipment and police go on strike over unpaid salaries, is also partly due to the downturn in the oil industry, which has a major presence in Rio. However, the idea of putting Cedae up for sale has been controversial. Protesting employees and riot police have been in violent confrontations twice in the last few weeks, although a demonstration outside the assembly building on Monday was so far peaceful. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
