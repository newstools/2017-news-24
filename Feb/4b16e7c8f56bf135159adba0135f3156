He's been charged with insulting the national flag and trying to overthrow President Robert Mugabe's government. His lawyers say he did not try to stage a coup and only called for non-violent means of protest.In an opinion piece for the state-controlled Sunday Mail, pro-Mugabe writer Lovemore Mataire said Mawarire was just a "commonplace" guy and a "charlatan" who managed to gather just a "handful" of sympathisers before leaving Zimbabwe in July last year.Though it appears many Zimbabweans are still weighing up whether to support Mawarire in 2017, his popularity in 2016 is less debatable. The success of a nationwide strike in early July led to his arrest - and even Mugabe criticised him.Said #ThisFlag: "He is well and in good spirits."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
