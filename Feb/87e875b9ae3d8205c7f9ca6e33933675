It had stocked more than 5 000 skins in a shack and a metal container in Benoni.Upon arrival police confiscated the skins. People who work in the area told the publication that "the skins belong to the Chinese" and that a truck often came to collect the skins. The skins are estimated to be worth up to R7 000 each.In the statement the NSPCA thanked Gumtree for the major step forward."We call upon other websites to follow this worthy lead and to widen this to include all animals." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
