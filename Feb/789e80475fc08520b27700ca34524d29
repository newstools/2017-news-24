Alison-Madueke has said she is in London to receive treatment for cancer.She is the subject of a Scotland Yard investigation and has been briefly detained for questioning in London.The commission also has seized a $37.5m &nbsp;apartment block in Lagos, an $18m mansion in Abuja, the capital, and is investigating properties in Britain and the United States allegedly bought by Alison-Madueke with stolen government funds.Judge Muslim Hassan ordered Thursday's forfeiture after nobody showed up in court to prove the money was legitimate. It was held in local naira currency and US dollars in three Nigerian banks.The anti-corruption commission announced his ruling on social media and declared "the former minister is being prosecuted."Hundreds of people have been detained and thousands investigated but the commission has yet to successfully prosecute one high-profile case.In the biggest, security agents have illegally detained former national security adviser Sambo Dasuki since December 2015 on charges of misappropriating $2.1 billion meant to buy weapons to fight the Boko Haram Islamic uprising. Dasuki has said he acted on orders of former President Goodluck Jonathan, using the money to bribe party officials to ensure Jonathan won a presidential primary. Jonathan lost March 2015 elections to President Muhammadu Buhari, who promised to halt endemic corruption. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
