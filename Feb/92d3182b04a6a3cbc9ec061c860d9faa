Joining "an international forum in the presence of an unrecognised entity cannot imply the state's recognition of that entity", he said. Arab countries and Iran are UN members along with Israel, which they do not recognise, he added."Does Algeria recognise Israel simply by sitting beside it at the UN?""The return of Morocco is a direct challenge to the presence of the Polisario within the AU," the diplomatic source said."Morocco will continue to mobilise to delegitimise the SADR."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
