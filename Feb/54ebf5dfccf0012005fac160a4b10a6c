	     Polokwane - A man was arrested after a white lion was killed and decapitated on a game farm near Alldays, Limpopo police said on Wednesday. The 31-year-old man and three suspected accomplices allegedly fed three lions in an enclosure on the Ingogo Safari Lodge poisoned chicken meat on Tuesday, Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said. One of the lions died and the poachers cut off its head and paws. These were recovered when the man was arrested. His accomplices were still at large.  The poachers appear to have been disturbed while trying to skin the lion. A vet was called to treat the surviving two lions. They could not walk and were vomiting. At least six lions were killed in Limpopo in January.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
