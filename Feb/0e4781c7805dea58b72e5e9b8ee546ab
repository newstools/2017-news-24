The Constitutional Court&rsquo;s ruling meant the SA National Roads Agency Limited had to restart a public participation process if it wanted to continue its plans to toll sections of the N1 and N2 in the Western Cape.&ldquo;Sanral has no choice but to concede that they followed an improper and unlawful process,&rdquo; City of Cape Town mayoral committee member for urban development and transport, Brett Herron, said in a statement.&nbsp;Toll roads on the N1 and N2 would cost consumers R62bn in fees over 30 years, he said.&nbsp;The court ruled that Sanral must pay the city's legal costs.&ldquo;As of 20 September, the city&rsquo;s legal costs in the Winelands tolling matter stood at R20 653 756,&rdquo; Herron said.Sanral did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.Herron called on Sanral to work with the city to find solutions to the infrastructural upgrades that may be required for the N1 and N2 freeways.&nbsp;The Western Cape is the only province that has permission from National Treasury to implement an additional fuel levy to finance roads, but has not implemented this. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
