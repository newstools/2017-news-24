This includes the centres in Lorraine and Algoa Park, where 239 residents will stay until a new contract can be signed."Sihlwayi said last week, after the release of Health Ombudsman Malegapuru Makgoba's damning report into the deaths of 94 psychiatric patients in Gauteng, that it was misleading to compare that situation to her attempts to correct&nbsp;irregular and excessive subsidies for beneficiaries.Makgoba had found that at least 94 psychiatric patients who had been moved from Life Esidimeni to NGOs had died as a result of neglect and mismanagement."I will definitely study his report and take note of any implications there might be for the Eastern Cape. It is of critical importance that my department and NGOs discuss the matter and I have decided to investigate inadequate service delivery and will welcome new tenders."&nbsp;"A community is judged by how it cares for the elderly and the frail," she said.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
