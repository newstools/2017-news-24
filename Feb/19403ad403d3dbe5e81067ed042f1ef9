"But the bottom line is that this does not undo legal protections for trans students, and school districts can and must continue to protect them and all students from discrimination.""School districts that recognise that should continue doing the right thing; for the rest, we'll see them in court," he added.The US Supreme Court is set next month to consider the case of a 17-year-old in Virginia who was born a female but identifies as a male and filed suit to be able to use the boys' bathroom at his high school.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
