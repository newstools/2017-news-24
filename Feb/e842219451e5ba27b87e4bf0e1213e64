Also known as Oyala, Djibloho lies in the middle of a rainforest region, not far from the eastern border with Gabon. It is surrounded by several national parks.As the government moved in, Prime Minister Francisco Pascual Obama Asue warned lawmakers it should not be seen as "going on holiday"."Your relocation here does not mean that you are engaging in tourism or going on holiday," he said, insisting it should not "disrupt administrative culture."President Teodoro Obiang Nguema chose Djibloho as one of the cities he wanted to develop using the country's oil wealth in the hope it will become the nation's new administrative capital.Equatorial Guinea is Africa's only Spanish-speaking nation and the continent's third-biggest oil producer, although more than half of the population lives below the poverty line.In January, Equatorial Guinea's government granted asylum to former Gambian leader Yahya Jammeh, who for weeks had refused to accept his election defeat and cede power to new President Adama Barrow.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
