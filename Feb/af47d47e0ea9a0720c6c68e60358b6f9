Watch. WATCHCape Town &ndash; The City of Cape Town said on Sunday that a service provider has been unable to keep up with residents' demand for state-funded flavoured condoms.In August Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa introduced the MAX condoms in Parliament after receiving complaints that the previous Choice condoms were smelly and noisy.The new condoms come in a range of colours and flavours, including strawberry, grape and vanilla.Mayoral committee member for safety, JP Smith, said in the statement that clinics in Cape Town had run out of the condoms"We appeal to the public to be responsible and abstain, or use the plain Choice condoms in the meantime. Let safety and responsibility be the flavour of the month if vanilla or strawberry cannot," Smith said.Additional supply is expected early next week.Smith said the city had experienced a drop in reported sexually transmitted infections (STIs).Over a 12-month period, 41 153 new STIs were treated, an average of 3 429 a month. This figure is slightly lower than the previous year&rsquo;s average of 3 599 a month, Smith said."The drop in the number of sexually transmitted infections is not significant. Stigma remains a real challenge and there are people who refuse to seek help because they&rsquo;re concerned about attitudes and perceptions," Smith said.He said the city distributed 50 million male condoms and more than 1.5 million female condoms in the past 12 months.That means that for every man in Cape Town there were roughly 25 free condoms and roughly one condom for every woman. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
