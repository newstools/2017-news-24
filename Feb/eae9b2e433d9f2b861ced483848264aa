The JMPD officer discharged his firearm on Saturday evening when a crowd of people allegedly gathered to attack his mother’s house and damage his car, spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said. Minnaar said this followed an argument between his mother and a neighbour. He said it was also alleged that the officer's brother, who is a member of the SAPS, was arrested for having shot and killed a person. That shooting is believed to have arisen from the same situation. "The JMPD officer will be investigated internally for having used a service pistol while he was off-duty," Minnaar said.
