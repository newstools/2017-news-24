The parties signed a deal that has yet to be implemented.The stalemate already has worried observers, and Tshisekedi's death likely will compound the difficulties.Meanwhile, Chairperson of the Southern African Partnership for Democratic Change, Mmusi Maimane, said in a statement that Tshisekedi, during "his long and illustrious political career, stood up for democracy and justice in the face of dictatorship and the erosion of the will of the people, a cornerstone of democratic governance".Maimane said the opposition leader displayed a sense of service to the people "by even standing up against those considered to be his close political allies, when they veered off the path of democracy and human rights".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
