	     Durban - A KwaZulu-Natal Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) officer has been charged with corruption after allegedly taking a R500 bribe, the Hawks said on Monday.  It is alleged that on February 7, RTI officer Khangelani Mpanzela, 43, told a motorist that he would scrap ticket if they paid him R500.  According to the Hawks, the driver agreed to pay the bribe at a later stage and then reported the incident to the Hawks Anti-Corruption Unit in Durban.

He was immediately arrested and charged for corruption," Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said. Mpanzela appeared in the Umzimkhulu Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday last week and was granted R5 000 bail. The case was postponed to March 7. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
