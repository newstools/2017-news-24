The crisis remains at Sekhukhune," Sadtu provincial secretary Matome Raphasha told News24 on Thursday.The union hoped that the education department would move swiftly to address the problem as it argued that the lack of these materials at schools could have a ripple effect and affect final exams.Court challenge"It is possible that there could be omissions and shortfalls," said Limpopo education department spokesperson Naledzani Rasila.Rasila advised affected schools to contact their circuit offices.Earlier this year a legal challenge was launched over the tender to deliver stationery in the province.On Tuesday the education department was successful in a case involving two service providers who claimed that those awarded the stationery delivery tenders were irregularly appointed.The two losing bidders took the department to court to try and get an interdict and to overturn its tender decision, and therefore halt delivery of stationery in the province.The companies, Afropulse and Freedom Stationery, sought to overturn the awarding of the tender to African Paper Products and instead have it awarded to the two companies.But the department had argued that it had almost completed the delivery of stationery to the 4 000 schools in the province.&nbsp; &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
