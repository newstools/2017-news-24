It was aimed at black industrialists and it was claimed that Magashule would be the guest speaker. &nbsp;Magashule was in Russia on an official visit on December 3, 2015, the day on which the &ldquo;seminar&rdquo; was supposed to have been held at the Emoya estate near Bloemfontein.&nbsp;According to the Facebook ad, the seminar would have been about getting tenders and how to get onto the provincial government&rsquo;s list of suppliers. The price was R895 per person, or R8 950 for a table. &nbsp;However, there was no seminar.Radebe said in his plea bargain that he knew what he had done was wrong and wanted the court to punish him. He said after the premier&rsquo;s office caught him out, he repaid all the money.&nbsp;Soomaroo found Radebe guilty on the second charge of fraud for opening an account at OK Furnishers in Heidedal on September 25, 2013, using someone else&rsquo;s ID, payslip, and address. &nbsp; &nbsp;The owner of the ID had lost the document a few days earlier.&nbsp;Radebe pasted his photo into the ID and presented it as his own.&nbsp;He bought a TV and fridge worth more than R15 000, which he would have paid in instalments. He was arrested in the store after the salesperson verified his details.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
