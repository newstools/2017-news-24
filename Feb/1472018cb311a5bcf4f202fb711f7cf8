The movement, concentrated in the southwest, seeks the restoration of the former Congolese kingdom inside pre-colonial boundaries, which would comprise parts of Angola, Congo and Gabon. Police and other witnesses told AFP shots could be heard near the residence of BDK's spiritual leader Ne Muanda Nsemi, which was cordoned off by police.Nsemi, a member of parliament in Kinshasa who has never been arrested, was not found.In videos recently posted online, Nsemi called for an insurrection against President Joseph Kabila."In two weeks, I will strike," he says in one video posted a few days ago.The government has accused BDK followers of a string of violent attacks in western DRC since January. The government says violent clashes between the group and police killed 27 people in 2008, while UN and civilian sources put the death toll at nearer 100.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
