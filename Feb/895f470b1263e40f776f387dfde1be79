It's not my style or interest to be entangled in a legal battle with the Public Protector."When asked if she thought it was an act of vengeance for her work on both her Nkandla report and State of Capture report, she said it was possible, but had no evidence.She also said it was "bizarre" that she has never met Mkhwebane personally, and that attempts to do so had failed during the handover phase.However, she did not want to speak out against Mkhwebane, reaffirming her stance that it is not collegial to speak out on one's successor.Presidency spokesperson Dr Bongani Ngqulunga was not immediately available for comment on Saturday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
