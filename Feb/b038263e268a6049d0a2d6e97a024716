They had promised there would not be any restrictions on journalists doing their jobs.Instead, the mood at Parliament had been one of fear and intimidation, said Sanef chairperson Mahlatse Gallens.She said this was despite written correspondence and meetings with parliamentary officials beforehand.&nbsp;"We don&rsquo;t know what next year will bring, and what the rest of the parliamentary calendar will bring," added Katopodis.Sanef called on Parliament&rsquo;s political and administrative leadership to address the progressive heightening of security measures and securitisation.Gallens said they would set up meetings with parliamentary and police officials in good faith.She said Sanef&rsquo;s concerns pointed to a broader movement of returning to a "People&rsquo;s Parliament", one that was open and approachable.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
