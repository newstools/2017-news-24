Zinde was sent there in June for assessments and a report was finalised.Stopped functioning sociallyIn order to dispute the report, the defence appointed a psychiatrist, Dr John Weinkove, to assess Zinde's mental state. Weinkove differed with the "Review of Condition" Dr Coetzee at Weskoppies compiled."I believe Zinde suffers from schizophrenia with predominantly negative features. I recommend that he should be re-admitted to Weskoppies for a review of his condition," Weinkove said in a statement Joubert had read to the court.According to Weinkove's statement, Zinde stopped functioning socially about four years ago. This suggested the onset of his mental illness.He recommended a computed tomography (CAT scan) of Zinde&rsquo;s brain, as well as an electroencephalogram (EEG).He said there appeared to be a history of similar illness in his father's family. His mother was described as having mood swings, which could point to susceptibility to schizophrenia.Zinde was arrested in June 2016, after his 50-year-old mother's body was found in the boot of her Range Rover at her home in Pecanwood Estate, Hartbeespoort.At the time, it was reported that a friend had struggled to get hold of her for a few days and that her son had refused to open the door. He only opened it when police arrived.Prosecutor Hanna Conradie argued that four other psychiatrists had already evaluated Zinde at Weskoppies. All of them had found he had criminal capacity and could distinguish between right and wrong and follow court proceedings.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
