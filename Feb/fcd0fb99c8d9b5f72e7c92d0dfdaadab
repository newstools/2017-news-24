Of these complaints, the commission found an increase in social media being cited as a "location" where some of these race-based complaints were found.A question was posed to Mzinyathi during his presentation on the finer details around who could possibly face prosecution once the Act was law.'Intention is a frame of mind'If someone in South Africa had shared a hateful post which originated in a different country, the South African user could still face possible prosecution for sharing the content, however intent to cause harm needed to be proved, Mzinyathi said."Intention is a frame of mind, so as part of the investigation, I think the investigators will have to look into all the surrounding circumstances of the person who re-sends the [post].&ldquo;In the context of criminal law, every offence must have the element of intention and we may have to grapple with what extent the offences are covered in the Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Act are.&rdquo;For now, Mzinyathi said the bill was still in its draft form and consultations on it were still underway. The NPA has already submitted its proposals on aspects of the Act which it feels have room for improvement, he said.Earlier, the justice department's Chief Director of Social Justice and Participatory Democracy, Danaline Franzman, said the bill was expected to be finalised and be presented to Cabinet by September this year.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
