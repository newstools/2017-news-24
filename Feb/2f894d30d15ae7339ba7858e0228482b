Staff shortages and a lack of equipment have also failed to be tackled.Kenyan university lecturers have also been on strike since last month over pay.The widespread, disruptive industrial action comes months before an August general election in which President Uhuru Kenyatta hopes to win a second term.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
