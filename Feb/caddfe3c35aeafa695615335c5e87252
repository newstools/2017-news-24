Maize or corn accounts for almost 70% of total cereal production in southern Africa according to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, with a large percentage grown directly for home consumption.The pest is also known to have caused major damage to other economically important crops including rice, soybean and cotton.The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) has announced an emergency regional meeting to be held on February 14-16 in Harare, Zimbabwe after the pest was also identified in southern Africa."Preliminary reports indicate possible presence (of the pest) in Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe" FAO sub-regional co-ordinator for southern Africa, David Phiri, said in a statement last week.Zambia has already spent $3m in an attempt to control the pest that has affected approximately 130 000ha of crops.But the FAO emphasised that the full extent of the damage there and in other affected countries is yet to be established.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
