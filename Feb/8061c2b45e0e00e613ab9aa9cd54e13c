Mahlobo backtracks on relationship with student leaderU-turnMahlobo made the comments while speaking at a panel discussion hosted by the Institute of Security Studies on November 14.In a video of the event, posted by a Daily Vox journalist on November 14, Mahlobo says he is not responsible for Dlamini's arrest. Police nabbed him, he said."But I happen to know Mcebo. He has been to my house several times," he said, before calling for the country to let the courts deal with the matter.Two days later, Mahlobo said newspaper reports should not be quoted as facts."Mcebo Dlamini has never been to my house. That meeting never took place," he told Parliament.The Democratic Alliance objected to the matter being referred to the committee, citing the fact that the party had already referred it to the public protector&rsquo;s office in November.&ldquo;Any attempt to have a parliamentary committee do so instead would undermine the Public Protector&rsquo;s investigation and may help Mahlobo avoid accountability for violating the Executive Ethics Code,&rdquo; DA chief whip John Steenhuisen said on Wednesday.He appealed to the Speaker not to let the powers and privileges committee deal with such an important matter.&ldquo;Although we have little doubt that Mahlobo holds the National Assembly in contempt, we believe he made himself guilty of a more serious breach when he deliberately misled the House on 16 November 2016.&ldquo;We cannot allow the powers and privileges committee to fudge this important matter, especially amid a growing trend of members of the executive lying to the House,&rdquo; Steenhuisen said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
