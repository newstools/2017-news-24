And when we take office in the Union Buildings and embark on our rescue mission, I trust we can count on your continued support to make this wonderful country of ours to work for all our people,&rdquo; he said, addressing a room of diplomats in Cape Town.The party had outlined a rescue plan aimed at equipping the youth of the &ldquo;lost generation&rdquo;. He said the DA was the only party that was willing to face the country&rsquo;s challenges and fight every battle.They would tackle service delivery, jobs, and create opportunities in abundance.Young people, the so-called born frees, were locked in an economy with no jobs or opportunities and with little hope of finding their way back in.&ldquo;We will never give up on the lost generation. They are our brothers, sisters, our children, grandchildren. We will not gamble with their future,&rdquo; he said.Maimane said it was unfair that a black child in South Africa was still one hundred times more likely to grow up in poverty than a white child. Freedom, fairness, and opportunity would be at the heart of the party&rsquo;s plan to rescue this lost generation.&ldquo;A policy package that puts every young person at the centre of their own development, a master of their own destiny,&rdquo; he said.Repeatedly using the Western Cape as a blue print of their success, Maimane said the DA was already preparing to run the national government.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
