Officials had been at the centre to establish the facts, he said."Our suspicions were raised by the staff's conduct on Monday," he told News24.The department was mandated by law to probe such incidents and took its responsibility seriously, Ngobese added.Fritz said the centre, which has apparently been shut down following the claims, was a registered early childhood development (ECD) centre and received funding from the department.Fritz said the department took its oversight role of the centres seriously and has invested R290m into the sector for the current financial year. &nbsp; "Registration allows for the department to provide funding and inspections of facilities to ensure compliance on health and safety aspects, as well as the quality of ECD curriculum," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
