Explaining how the NIA would be reformed, the same statement from Barrow's office said its name would change and its functions would be limited to "intelligence gathering, analysis and advice to the relevant arms of government responsible for internal and external security." The NIA "has not limited itself to work within its mandate but has abused the office and instilled fear amongst citizens," the statement added.Barrow took refuge in Senegal on January 15, fearing for his safety after Jammeh reversed his acceptance of the election result and sought for six weeks to cling to power.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
