This year is an ANC elective year, so her utterances of local economic development are a leap to further patronage," Louw said.'We will disrupt her when she replies'EFF leader George Nyakama said that they had decided to postpone their disruptions until the SOPA debate."We will disrupt her when she replies next week."In a strange turn of events, the SOPA debate will not be held in the legislature.Speaker Kenny Mmoeimang announced that the debate would take place on February 28 at the Warrenton Multipurpose Centre.The ANC's Zamani Saul welcomed Lucas speech, saying it was in keeping with their electoral mandate.This week, ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe was apparently called to defuse the tensions between Lucas and Saul."I'm hearing of media reports of tensions between us ahead of the conference. The secretary general is not a high level intervention; it's a case of him just doing his normal duties," Saul said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
