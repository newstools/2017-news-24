Both Cabinet and Zuma distanced themselves from Zwane&rsquo;s statement, saying it had been issued in his personal capacity, not on behalf of Cabinet or a task team.Zuma later informed Parliament through a written reply that he had reprimanded Zwane for irregularly issuing a statement on behalf of Cabinet.TALK TO USWhat do you make of Zuma&rsquo;s letter to Mosebenzi Zwane?SMS us on 35697 using the keyword ZWANE and tell us what you think.
