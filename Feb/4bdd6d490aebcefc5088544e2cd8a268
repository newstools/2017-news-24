The EFF was also being prevented from openly discussing the issue of land occupation."If we are here because we are in full support of all the land occupation struggles, if we are here charged around the matter that we agree that land must be expropriated, then why aren't all those people of the ANC in court as well?" Ndlozi asked.He accused the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) of having double standards."Why is the NPA not charging [President Jacob] Zuma as he has also been going around agreeing with the question of land occupation?" he asked.Land and Rural Development Minister Gugile Nkwinti should be in court as well, he continued."Why would you be charged for advocating for land occupation in an obvious environment of colonial land ownership that continues 23 years into democracy?" Ndlozi asked.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
