"We are simply asking for the re-opening of the two media."Mathias Ayena, from the regulator, had told AFP earlier that neither channel obtained the proper authorisation before they started broadcasting in 2007.Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranked Togo 88th in its press freedom index last year and said the government controlled information through a dominant state media.Amnesty International called the sanction disproportionate and "an attack against freedom of speech".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
