Watch her speak about the extra precautions the city is taking to ensure Cape Town doesn't run out of water.WATCHCape Town &ndash; The City of Cape Town is set to release the identities of all customers found guilty of contravention of Level 3B water restrictions on Monday.This after the City said water consumption needed to decrease by more than 100 million litres per day, from a current 825 million litres average, to below 700 million litres to ensure sufficient supply.Mayor Patricia de Lille&rsquo;s spokesperson Zara Nicholson told News24 that this step followed repeated offences by certain residents."Dam levels continue to drop, yet some people aren&rsquo;t doing much to decrease consumption. We are stepping up our efforts to save water; we are naming and shaming residents that don&rsquo;t seem to care," Nicholson said.Nicholson was unable to tell News24 how many days of consumption was left if users were unable to decrease consumption by 100 million litres.On February 14, the city&rsquo;s dam levels decreased to 36.2%. The City said the last 10% of dams were unusable, which meant dam levels were effectively at 26.2%.In a statement on Thursday, De Lille said they had identified 20 000 residents with excessive water usage of more than 50 000 litres per month."This is unacceptable and I am making it my mission to engage with these customers so that they adhere to Level 3B restrictions, as their abuse of water means that we all will suffer," De Lille said.'Where necessary, water will be cut'De Lille visited homes in Pinelands on Thursday whose consumption over the past 12 months ranged between 55 000 to 159 000 litres per month.The mayor and Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson has personally been phoning high consumers in an effort to decrease consumption.Annually, the metro uses about 65% of the water taken from the Western Cape water supply system. Currently, while the agriculture sector is still irrigating, the metro accounts for 40% of the use.Department of Water and Sanitation spokesperson Phetho Ntaba told News24 that water restrictions had been introduced to farms in the region."Where necessary, water will be cut, or possible fines will be imposed by the water supply establishment," Ntaba said.Ntaba was unable to specify what the restrictions are. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
