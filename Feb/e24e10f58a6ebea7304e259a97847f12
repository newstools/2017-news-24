We were promised that they will try their level best to retrieve the container, whether they were still dead or alive. We just wanted to see their bodies.&rdquo;Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane promised to do everything in his power to help them, Eunice says.&nbsp;&ldquo;We went to Pretoria with the family last year just to get hold of Zwane.

It was painful for us because he didn&rsquo;t even bother to show his face to these poor families.&rdquo;&lsquo;I will miss him&rsquo;The mother of three says he was the only brother she had.&nbsp;&ldquo;My children would ask me when their uncle is coming back. It is very difficult for me to explain to my kids.&rdquo;&nbsp;Their mother has Down Syndrome and finds it difficult to understand that Solomon is no longer with them.&nbsp;Eunice sighs and says their mother thinks her son is still at work.&nbsp;She will remember her brother for his humbleness and the love he had for her children.&ldquo;I will miss him very much.
