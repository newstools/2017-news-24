WATCHMbombela - Two &nbsp;municipalities in Mpumalanga that are struggling to settle their debt to Eskom will face a bleak weekend as they will be hit with more power interruptions.The power utility said they would continue interrupting power supply to the eMalahleni and Msukaligwa municipalities in Mpumalanga over the weekend. On Saturday and Sunday, the municipality will be in the dark from 08h30 to 11h00 and 15h00 to 17h30. On Monday, the schedule will go back to 06h00 to 08h00 and 17h00 to 19h30 from Monday to Friday. &ldquo;The interruption of supply as a result of non-payment remains an agonising decision for Eskom and is a means of last resort. We hope the municipalities will come up with a sustainable payment plan and thus avert further interruptions for its citizens," said Eskom Group Executive for Customer Services Ayanda Noah. Eskom has opted for a softer approach of interrupting electricity during certain hours in the day, the utility said. On Friday, the co-operative governance and traditional affairs department noted that out of 64 municipalities that owed Eskom, 50 municipalities made payment agreements, whilst 14 were in discussion to enter into agreements with the electricity provider. They called for provinces to devise mechanisms to closely monitor the adherence to payment plans that will reduce the municipal debt.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
