WATCHCape Town &ndash; A Brazilian same-sex couple were verbally assaulted during a photographic shoot in Cape Town at the weekend.Plat&atilde;o and Rafael Terra allege that a middle-aged man threatened them and called their relationship &ldquo;unnatural&rdquo; as wedding photographer Wesley Vorster was taking photos of them at Glen Beach on Saturday afternoon.The couple have been together for 11 years and married for three years.&ldquo;We were up on a rock and we didn&rsquo;t kiss or embrace affectionately, when a man with a child came walking towards us,&rdquo; Plat&atilde;o told News24 on Monday.Plat&atilde;o said the man was sitting about 50m away with two young boys.&ldquo;He shouted, asking us not to kiss each other in front of him. He said that what we are doing is unnatural, that it was a bad influence on the children,&rdquo; Plat&atilde;o said.&ldquo;When he started to shout, I was very afraid. We were on a rock and I was afraid he could push us off,&rdquo; Plat&atilde;o said. His partner was left shaken.Vorster said he had expected the worst could happen as the man was very aggressive. Vorster said his clients were not doing anything to provoke the man.&ldquo;All of us felt that sudden shock of not being able to control what this man might do.&rdquo;Plat&atilde;o said coming to Cape Town on holiday had been their long-time dream and that the experience had not put them off the city.&ldquo;South Africa is known for its liberal status that accepts gay marriage. We&rsquo;ve never ever suffered anything like this in Brazil. When we got married everyone accepted it.&ldquo;It took us one night where we were a bit shaken, but the next day we were back enjoying Cape Town. This is one man in a thousand. We know that the majority of Cape Town is not like this.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
