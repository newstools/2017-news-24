He was granted bail of R5000. The case was postponed to Tuesday, March 21 pending further investigation.&ldquo;The office of the Speaker is meant to act objectively, fairly and with great integrity when it comes to council matters and we cannot have a Speaker who is in jail cells, when he should be working to solve the enormous issues of delivery breakdown in Walter Sisulu,&rdquo; said Nel.Mulaudzi said in a separate incident, two Eastern Cape provincial traffic officers from Maletswai Municipality in Aliwal North, and a driving school instructor from the same area had also been arrested for allegedly selling learner and driver&rsquo;s licenses.&ldquo;The three suspects are suspected to have raked in thousands of rands and investigations are ongoing,&rdquo; he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
