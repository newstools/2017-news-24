They are angry that improvements to properties and premises within the city are driving poor people out as they can no longer afford to live in it.After a protest and court applications, the city intervened. It offered the residents free corrugated iron shacks in Wolwerivier, 28km north of the city.This case would set a precedent, because the residents were not opposing the emergency shelter, but its location.Pillay said the Wolwerivier site, which already had 428 structures housing 1 122 occupants, may not be right next to schools and clinics, but was within a reasonable distance of these facilities.Asked how long they would have to live in the temporary shelters, she said it would be either until they got to the top of a State housing list, or until they could afford to move on.Pillay took Judge Leslie Weinkove through the relevant points of the National Housing Code and the National Housing Act. She submitted that the city could offer people emergency shelter with the resources it had. In this case, it already had Wolwerivier.The provision to cater to those who needed emergency temporary housing was brought in after a landmark Constitutional Court judgment in favour of Irene Grootboom.READ: Bromwell Street judge stuns with court commentsTemporary emergency housingPillay explained that before the Grootboom judgment, there was nothing to force the government to arrange temporary emergency housing for people in need after evictions or a disaster.Rules on the provision of temporary emergency shelter were prepared and came into force after that. It was available to anybody in an emergency situation. Exceptions include people who have insurance to cover themselves.The code stipulates that municipalities and government departments cannot use their emergency shelter allocation to build permanent houses.If they did not have money for emergency shelters, it could ask the provincial government for help.With the Wolwerivier emergency camp already established, the city did not have to.&ldquo;We cannot develop emergency housing closer to the city for a host of reasons. In those circumstances, the residents cannot compel the city to do so. And it ought not to be compelled to because they have no right to choose a location as to where they live.&rdquo;Only national government had the authority to release one of the 45 parcels of land that resident and group spokesperson Charnell Commando compiled and proposed, Pillay said.The city had rejected Commando's suggested erfs as not suitable.&lsquo;Disgusting&rsquo; remarksOn Tuesday, Weinkove questioned Commando's credentials. She stunned the court by calling her a &ldquo;kitchen assistant&rdquo;, who knew nothing about municipal planning.Outside the court, Commando said Weinkove's remarks disgusted her.&ldquo;People don't know your situation, what is happening in your life. It's because they're not in your shoes, they don't know what it is like,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;At least we are working class people. We don't go around stealing, or robbing people.&rdquo;The application continues. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
