We went to MultiChoice [satellite television provide DSTV]. We also delivered that message."We also went to the South African High Commission [embassy] where we burned their flag to pass on a message to them that we don't have a relationship any longer."Kadiri added: "All the South Africans in Nigeria should leave Nigeria within 48 hours or else we won't be able to guarantee their security."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
