The UN says more than 52 000 South Sudanese refugees have arrived &nbsp;in Uganda since the start of the year and the numbers are currently growing by over 4 000 per day. The Ugandan minister for refugees, Hilary Onek, said the the scale of arrivals is stretching the capacity of one of the world's poorest countries. "We are worried about the load we are bearing," Onek said. "It's getting a little heavy for us to manage." Uganda has been praised for offering one of the most favourable refugee protection environments in the world - providing for freedom of movement, the right to work and land for refugee camps.However, there have been isolated incidents of local politicians rallying people against refugees. In the past week police and residents near Nakivale refugee camp in the southwest of Uganda clashed in a dispute over land allocation to refugees.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
