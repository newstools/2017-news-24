We are appealing to well-wishers to do so willingly and not to come again tomorrow and say we were forced. "All A2 farmers who got offer letters must donate a beast each for this event and those that will fail we will take it that they don't appreciate what the president has done for them," Khanye was quoted as saying.Last month the ruling&nbsp;Zanu-PF youth league&nbsp;said that Mugabe's birthday&nbsp;should be celebrated like Christmas Day.The party's national youth leader, Kudzai Chipanga maintained at the time that the veteran leader's birthday should not be treated like an "ordinary day". "To us, February 21 is not just a day. To us, it is a special day we treat in the same manner Christians treat December 25, the birthday of Jesus Christ. I don't want to be blasphemous, but in my humble view, President Mugabe is second to Jesus Christ. He is our saviour, so his birthday means a lot for us the youths of Zimbabwe,&rdquo; Chipanga was quoted as saying. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
