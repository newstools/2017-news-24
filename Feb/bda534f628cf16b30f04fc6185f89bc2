However Abrahams said Masoka is dishonest and unreliable."Masoka has proven himself to be a dishonest and unreliable person and in the absence of some tangible and objective evidence, the prosecution is bound not to succeed," Abrahams said.Eight years after Phakoe's murder his family continues to call for justice to be served.Phetoe, who has been relentless in his efforts for Phakoe's murders to be brought to book, told News24 he was disappointed it took so long for the NPA to decide not to charge the police."We are disappointed with the conduct of the NPA, we still want answers on who killed Moss Phakoe," Phetoe said.He maintains that the murder was political and remains hopeful that the perjury case will shed more light on it."That man charged with perjury, he must explain why he lied to the court, who gave him money to lie; and hopefully with that evidence the case will start afresh," Phetoe said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
