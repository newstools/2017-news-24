In 2003, Zimbabwe pulled out of the Commonwealth, a group made up mostly of former British colonies.In Zimbabwe, there have been no such curbs on the old fashion."It's an archaic and unnecessary practice that has even been abandoned by those who exported it to us as a nation. It does not improve jurisprudence or enhance the thinking capacity of judges," said Arnold Tsunga, a Zimbabwean lawyer and International Commission of Jurists regional program director for Africa.Scrapping the traditional dress code could save money in financially troubled Zimbabwe, Tsunga said.In 2013, Zimbabwean judges appealed for new regalia to replace worn-out, secondhand robes and wigs given to them by retired judges."Mugabe gives an impression that he hates the British; he is really fond of their culture and traditions," said Alex Magaisa, a law lecturer at Britain's University of Kent.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
