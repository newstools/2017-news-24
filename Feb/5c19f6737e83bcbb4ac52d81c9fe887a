It was relocated to an area which was allocated on the basis of ethnic affiliation."The claimed properties are farms Verschfontein 233LT (R/E and Portion 1), Elandsfontein 235 LT and Sterkfontein 203 LT in Greater Letaba Local Municipality in Limpopo Province.'Money can't restore dignity'Magada said the commission conducted a workshop at Mamaila Bolobedu Tribal Hall with the claimants."They indicated that they need alternative compensation because the claimed properties are not feasible to restore."When the Mamaila Bolobedu owned the land they had bigger portions of land and sufficient space to farm."They were farming with mangoes, maize, cattle and goats. During the removal, they left mangoes trees, graves and houses," said Magada."They started building new houses at the place they were given," said Magada.However, the area allocated to them was so small it was difficult for them to continue farming as they did previously. &nbsp; "There is no amount of money that can wipe away the pain suffered when they were forcefully taken away from their ancestral land. Similarly there is no amount of money that can restore the dignity lost during such dispossessions." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
