While teaching them, he said they are assholes and that they don&rsquo;t know Afrikaans.&ldquo;Two weeks ago, in another class, a teacher chased the students out of the class and said that they smell, therefore she can&rsquo;t teach them. So, she sent them to a black teacher to teach them,&rdquo; the parent alleged.&nbsp;The children, who cannot be named, claimed their complaints to the principal fell on deaf ears.&ldquo;The principal doesn&rsquo;t listen to us. We can&rsquo;t go to him and tell him what the teachers are doing because he doesn&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; one pupil said.Parents said they complained, and the department sent investigators last year and promised to follow up.A former pupil, Kagiso Mogale, said he had been told many times that &ldquo;his people&rdquo;, referring to blacks, were corroding the character and status of the school and bringing down its reputation.Another pupil said a teacher had told her to go back to Soweto because she could not swim.&ldquo;Our culture as black people was constantly being suppressed. At times, we were instructed not to speak African languages amongst ourselves,&rdquo; said Mogale.Department spokesperson Oupa Bodibe said district officials would visit the school on Friday morning to investigate.&ldquo;This is a very serious allegation and, if found to be true, the department will not hesitate to take appropriate disciplinary action against the school principal and everyone implicated.&rdquo;The principal did not respond to repeated requests to comment.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
