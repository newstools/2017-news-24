On the eve of the election, two mortar rounds fired by suspected extremists hit near the voting venue, a heavily guarded former air force base.The election of Farmajo and the peaceful transfer of power have been seen as a key step toward having Somalia's first fully functioning central government since 1991, when warlords ousted dictator Siad Barre and then turned on each other.Somalia is now an increasingly important partner for the US military on counter-terrorism efforts, including drone strikes against al-Shabaab leaders.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
