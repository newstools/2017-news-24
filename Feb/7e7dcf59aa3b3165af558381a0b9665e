We are not defenders of Pravin. We are the defenders of the integrity of the institutions of the state, particularly Treasury,&rdquo; leader Julius Malema told reporters.He said the uncertainty surrounding Gordhan&rsquo;s future as minister was not helping the country.&ldquo;Let him [Zuma] decide and justify his decision and stand by the decision if he thinks it&rsquo;s correct.&rdquo;He said the EFF would approach the Constitutional Court to compel Parliament to discipline Zuma for having failed to uphold, protect, and defend the Constitution.In a judgment handed down on March 31, 2016, the court found that Zuma failed to uphold the Constitution when he ignored former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s recommendation that he repay some of the R246m spent on so-called security upgrades to his private homestead in Nkandla.Malema then turned his attention to &ldquo;Nenegate&rdquo;. On December 9, 2015, Zuma fired Nhlanhla Nene as finance minister and replaced him with &ldquo;that clown&rdquo; ANC MP David van Rooyen.Following a public outcry and the rand plunging against the US dollar, Zuma replaced Van Rooyen with Gordhan on December 13.&ldquo;He then removed that clown. He is a coward and must live by his decision,&rdquo; Malema said of Zuma.&ldquo;Pravin must not resign, sitting there is very nice. We want to see what this man is going to do, let him take action,&rdquo; he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
