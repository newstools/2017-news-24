They're opinionated, they're arrogant, and they're just plain and simple useless. I am happy for a white person to assist me, or a coloured person, or an Indian person. I do not want a black person to assist me," she shouted."Let me tell you something. This is the type of police force we have got. We got a low calibre people working. If I see a black person, I will drive them over. If I have a gun, I will shoot everyone," she tells the officer before driving off.In a similar incident, the Umzinto Equality Court in June fined Penny Sparrow R150 000 for calling black beachgoers monkeys. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
