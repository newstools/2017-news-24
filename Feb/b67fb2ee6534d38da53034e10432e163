	     Polokwane - A white lion was killed and two other lions
survived poisoning after poachers targeted a game farm in Alldays, north-west
of Polokwane, local police said. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the
lion was found dead at the Ingogo Safari lodge on Tuesday. It is believed that the suspects threw poisoned chicken meat
into the cage housing the three lions, and all of them ate it.  “The other two lions were incapacitated by the poison but
the white one unfortunately died.” Mojapelo said the suspects then cut off the predator's paws
and head.  “The suspects appear to have been disturbed as they also
attempted to remove the skin but failed,” said Mojapelo. “A veterinarian was called to the scene to treat the
surviving sickly animals. They could not walk and the one was even vomiting.” At least six lions have been killed in the province since
January this year.  The suspects are still at large and police investigations
into the matter are continuing. Police have asked members of the public who might have
information on the suspects, to go to their nearest police station to report
their whereabouts. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
