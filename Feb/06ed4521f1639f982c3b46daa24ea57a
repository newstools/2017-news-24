WATCH: Tired Mugabe shows his age in a barely-audible birthday interviewHarare - Eyes closed, frequently fumbling for the right word: this was President&nbsp;Robert Mugabe&nbsp;finally showing his 93 years.In a sunlit room at State House in Harare, Mugabe has given his usual long interview to mark his birthday - but the longtime leader's masterful speaking style was mostly absent.The first part of the interview was broadcast on state ZBC television on Monday night."She is a very strong character, eh?"
