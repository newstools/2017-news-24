Anyone with information about the alleged crimes committed has been urged to come forward.The United States and France on Monday urged Kinshasa's government to open an inquiry, with a US State Department spokesperson condemning the "heinous abuses" seen in the video.The Kasai region has been plagued by violence since mid-August when government forces killed a tribal chief and militia leader, Kamwina Nsapu, who had rebelled against the central government.At least 200 people have been killed since then, leading the UN mission in the country to pledge at least 100 peacekeepers for the region.The authenticity of the Kasai video has not been proven. It appears to have been shot with a mobile phone by a member of an eight-man squad of troops who speak Lingala (the army's official language) and Swahili (the language of the eastern DRC).Two other videos emerged on Monday, supposedly taken in the same region, also purportedly showing abuses by DRC forces.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
