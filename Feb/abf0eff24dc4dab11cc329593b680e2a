She was treated by paramedics.The crowd later re-gathered.Makhubele said it was hard to estimate the crowd size because they were scattered in large groups.Last Sunday, residents forced their way into homes believed to be used for drug dealing and prostitution, carrying out the furniture and setting it alight.Household goods were carried out of four houses and destroyed between 10:00 and 13:30 before police managed to get the crowd to disperse, Captain Mavela Masondo said at the time.None of those homeowners laid any criminal charges, but police were investigating incidents of malicious damage to property and public violence.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
