Implementation of the next phase was delayed by three years due to a lack of funding.&ldquo;The cost for such a pilot scheme, that included pre-treatment and conveyance, was higher than anticipated and budget was not available when it came time for implementation,&rdquo; Limberg said.Water shortagesThe Berg River to Vo&euml;lvlei augmentation scheme, phase one, was selected as the next augmentation scheme to be implemented, Limberg said.After the city experienced water shortages, implementation for the extraction of the TMG Aquifer was reintroduced.Limberg believed the proposed pilot phase project would not have satisfied Cape Town&rsquo;s current water needs.&ldquo;The amount of water that would have been produced by the TMG pilot plant, as originally envisaged, would have been insignificant compared with the volume of water that users of the Western Cape water supply system, including agriculture, are required to save,&rdquo; she said.The TMG aquifer lies below large stretches of the Western Cape, between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, and is covered by a large, impermeable layer of rock.Cape Town is facing level 3B water restrictions for the first time. These limit the use of potable water for gardening. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
