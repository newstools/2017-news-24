I have asked our legal team to engage,&rdquo; DA leader Mmusi Maimane tweeted.Party spokesperson Mabine Seabe said the party would demand answers about the purpose and cost of the deployment.The presidency said in a statement that the SA National Defence Force members would help SAPS &ldquo;maintain law and order&rdquo; during Zuma&rsquo;s State of the Nation Address on Thursday.The EFF said the move was a &ldquo;declaration of war&rdquo; on the country&rsquo;s citizens.&ldquo;The military are people who get deployed for war and whose training is about killing the enemies of the state,&rdquo; spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said.The country had a duty to defend Parliament as a house of the people. It did not belong to Zuma, he said.&ldquo;Zuma has no constitutional mandate to impose law and order on Parliament; this is a direct violation of the separation of powers. Parliament&rsquo;s precinct must be respected as sacrosanct, with only the Speaker, in consultation with Members of Parliament, who can authorise security measures, not Zuma.&rdquo;No amount of security and intimidation would stop the EFF from holding Zuma accountable in terms of the Constitution, Ndlozi said.Constitutional law expert Pierre de Vos said it was a breach of the separation of powers.&ldquo;The executive cannot deploy the army to another branch of government - the legislature. Imagine if the president deployed 450 soldiers to the Constitutional Court while it was busy deciding whether the &lsquo;State of Capture&rsquo; report was valid. In both cases, it would be an outrage,&rdquo; he said.Will a show of force make us safer? Or is it the work of insecure &amp; fearful leaders whose paranoia threatens everyone&rsquo;s freedoms? #SONA2017#SONA2017 Preparations... pic.twitter.com/qIY5V7swbIActions of JZ in deploying the army can't be legal, violate the separation of powers, 4 personal use.
