Her parents initially discouraged her from choosing any form of art as a career as she was excelling academically at school.Thusi said it took a lot of sacrifice and courage to finally convince them that design was her calling and that she could make a success of it.&ldquo;Design is about breaking barriers, expressing ones&rsquo; emotions and doing the impossible,&rdquo; Thusi said.Mlambo said he had a difficult start to the year due to a lack of money and hoped the competition could help him. He was inspired by his mother&rsquo;s love for furniture as a sales lady at a retail store in KwaZulu-Natal.&ldquo;As kids we were also helping my father renovate houses and old buildings. This experience brought creativity and all sorts of ideas to us,&rdquo; Mlambo said.DUT senior digital design lecturer Suzan Barrot said she was delighted that some of their students have been selected as finalists in the competition. &nbsp;&ldquo;They now have to figure out exactly how this product is going to be made,&rdquo; she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
