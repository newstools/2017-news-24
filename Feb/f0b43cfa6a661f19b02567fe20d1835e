Mahlangu resigned the night before the report was released.&nbsp;&ldquo;Their fingerprints are peppered throughout the project. The decision was reckless, unwise and flawed, with inadequate planning and a chaotic and 'rushed or hurried' implementation process,&rdquo; he said.Makgoba found that although most of the deaths occurred at 16 of the 27 NGOs, all of them lacked experienced, qualified staff and the proper facilities and resources.Mahlangu had previously claimed that her department had vetted all the NGOs.There was prima facie evidence that certain officials and certain NGOs had violated the Constitution and contravened the National Health Care Act, Makgoba said.He recommended that disciplinary proceedings be instituted against Selebano and Manamela for gross misconduct for their conduct during the investigation, which included tampering with evidence. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
