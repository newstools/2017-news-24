Officials justified the move, saying the project was commissioned on an emergency basis, which Treasury allows.Johnson said the invitation had been sent out in December for the board to appear before the committee in February, and he did not understand why there were other commitments which more important."You are coming here to account on work done, and how you would have used the money appropriated by this Parliament. It&rsquo;s understandable that of the CEO, but that you don&rsquo;t have your DDG that deals with infrastructure, is a problem. That you don&rsquo;t have your full complement of the board, is a problem."No stone unturnedHe said they were dealing with serious matters and they were determined to get to the bottom of them.&ldquo;We are not going to leave any stone unturned on this specific one.&rdquo;He proposed that the committee not entertain the session from the water board, until they came back prepared.He said they had been very specific about requiring the full complement of the board."We don&rsquo;t know who your board members are," he said.Johnson said the committee did not come to Parliament to waste time, and that they meant business.Economic Freedom Fighters MP Makoti Khawula suggested that the board be made to pay for their flights and accommodation, as this amounted to fruitless and wasteful expenditure.While the proposal was not agreed to, it was not dismissed.Democratic Alliance MP Leon Basson suggested the board give reasons why they should not be made to pay for their flights and accommodation when they appeared in front of the committee again.The meeting would be rescheduled to a date in the following week, the committee said.Mokonyane is also due to brief the committee on "issues in the media" next week. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
