	     Johannesburg - DA MP Desiree van der Walt said the aftermath of the killing of farmworker Jan Railo, who was shot and killed during an alleged hunting accident, is a "sad case".  Van der Walt said without one of its breadwinners, the family is in desperate need of support. "That family is now minus income and they really need support. The situation there is not good at all and I felt very obliged to visit them as an MP in the area," said Van der Walt. Van der Walt visited the family on Monday to "deliver personal condolences and to hear what their needs are" two weeks after losing their loved one. Van der Walt said she had established that the family needs a house and access to social grant funds to pay for preschool for one of the children, among other things. Railo, 23, was shot and killed on a farm in Tuinplaas in Limpopo by Stephan Hepburn during an alleged hunting incident. It is believed that Hepburn and his wife were hunting warthogs on a friend's farm on a Saturday night when Hepburn fired shots in the direction from where he heard movement. Railo died on the scene after sustaining a wound to the face.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
