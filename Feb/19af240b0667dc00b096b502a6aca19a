Marite, Calcutta, Maviljan, and Malubane were the villages with the most illegal connections, municipal spokesperson Aubrey Mnisi said this week. The municipality consisted of a number of villages, most of which got running water from communal stand pipes and did not have a consistent supply. Hence the illegal activity.  Mnisi said the municipality was concerned about the tampering with and damage being done to infrastructure and its effect on the water supply. Plans and projects were in the pipeline to address the problem, he said.   Residents were urged to report criminal acts and illegal connections. The municipality had introduced by-laws and appointed 14 by-law enforcers.   At the same time, they were disconnecting all illegal connections and installing new meter readers and pipelines.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
