The violence in the Saint-Seine-Denis region, a working class region northeast of the French capital with a large minority population, erupted after a 22-year-old man was allegedly sodomised with a police officer's baton during an identity check last week. One officer was charged on Sunday with aggravated rape and three others were charged with aggravated assault. The officers deny the allegations. Authorities are wary of unrest in France's poor towns, recalling the fiery 2005 riots that spread through the country – beginning in the Saint-Denis town of Clichy-Sous-Bois, and hopscotching through social housing around the country.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
