The nation wept, because they knew that this was just words on a page written by the Luthuli House apparatchiks, going through the motions."Steenhuisen said many analysts thought Zuma looked nervous during his speech. He disagreed, and said Zuma let slip his true motives when he "giggled" while the EFF MPs were being thrown out of the House.&ldquo;The president was clearly relishing the brutal beating, breaking benches and the wails of terrified women in pain. Only a true tyrant will derive enjoyment watching those opponents elected into oversight over him be dealt with like this.&rdquo;Steenhuisen said it was bizarre that Zuma had deployed the army on the night. He said Zuma looked like an opposition leader fighting against his own party.Land, corruptionIn their debates, the ANC focused on land, and the DA on corruption.ANC KZN MP Sihle Zikalala said government was not scared of, or copying the EFF&rsquo;s policy on land."The era of radical economic transformation and the pursuit of black industrialist programmes must take centre stage. Africans cannot continue to work land to the benefit of a few who stole it by force."The ANC would use its majority to fast-track the Expropriation Act, he said.He praised the Zuma administration for successfully averting a credit downgrade in 2016.When DA MP Phumzile van Damme took to the podium, she lambasted Zuma and the effect of corruption on schools in rural areas. It was having the same effect as it did on the SABC."As the DA we will make very sure that those stealing your money will be brought to book," she said.She said "when the DA is elected" in 2019, her party would fight corruption and rising unemployment.Minister of Women in the Presidency, Susan Shabangu, praised the ANC's progressive policies to close the gender gap, and challenged the DA to follow their lead in the Western Cape.Shabangu thanked her colleague, Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor, for the bursaries her department had allocated to women in engineering and industry.Government's pending policy to distribute sanitary pads and towels to poor women had to be implemented nationwide, Shabangu said.DA MP Jacques Julius said corrupt officials were being prosecuted in the new metros his party took over after the August 3 local government elections, including Tshwane, Johannesburg, and Nelson Mandela Bay.&ldquo;When life is abundant&rdquo; the ANC had forgotten about the ordinary people, he said."They do not know us in inequality, and they certainly do not know us in poverty."The EFF and Cope did not attend the debate. The debate will continue on Wednesday. Zuma is expected to respond on Thursday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
