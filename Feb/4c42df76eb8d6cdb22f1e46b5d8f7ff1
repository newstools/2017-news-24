One rebel was killed, while seven others were wounded.Concerns are mounting that the hostilities between two rebel groups - the FPRC and another group known as the UPC - could lead to open warfare in the Bambari area.In December, UPC rebels were accused of killing 25 civilians in the town of Bakala hours after seven UPC rebels had been slain, according to Human Rights Watch.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
