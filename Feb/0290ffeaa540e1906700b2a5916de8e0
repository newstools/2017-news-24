Arrangements were being made to take the vessel into the Port of Ngqura, where firefighters were on standby, Samsa said in a statement.&nbsp; The APL Austria was about 30 nautical miles south-west of Cape St Francis when the fire broke out on Sunday. It was carrying several containers of hazardous cargo. None of them caught fire. The cause of the fire was not yet clear. An investigation was underway. The Harbour Master of the Port of Ngqura boarded the vessel after 04:00 on Monday to make an assessment and advise the ship&rsquo;s crew. Three Transnet National Ports Authority harbour tugboats helped fight the fire. "Lots of black smoke was emanating from the vessel. The weather conditions have been favourable since the incident occurred, with a light south-easterly wind," Samsa said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
