	     Durban - A 20-year-old woman from Lindelani in Durban was
arrested after she allegedly dumped her newborn baby in a two-metre deep
concrete pit latrine, KwaZulu-Natal police said on Thursday. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele told News24 that residents in the
area alerted police to the incident on Wednesday night. However, officers only
retrieved the infant's body and arrested the mother in the early hours of
Thursday morning. The woman is expected to appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrate's
Court on Friday on a charge of concealment of birth.  She is currently being treated at a clinic in the area while
under police guard, Mbhele said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
