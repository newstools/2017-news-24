Mailu told the Senate committee that the 2013 accord was defective, since county governments had not been involved and there was no go-ahead from a pay commission.Doctors have rejected a government offer to increase their salaries by 40%, according to union officials.The strikers, who also denounce endemic corruption, have the support of many Kenyans. Apart from their pay rise, they are demanding better equipment for public hospitals.Press reports recently pointed out that a member of parliament earns three times as much each month $10 600 than the best-paid surgeons in the country.With elections due in August, the doctor's strike is a thorny issue and potentially damaging for President Uhuru Kenyatta, who will be seeking a second term in office.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
