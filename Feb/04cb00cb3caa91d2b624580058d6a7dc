Without uniting the African majority, victory will always elude us."The question for us as leaders and activists is whether we are teaching our new recruits the same politics that Tambo would have taught them."He said Tambo would have chastised those who violated organisational discipline and protocol, even if they were his personal friends.He said current leaders should emulate Tambo&rsquo;s approach that the decisions of branches must not be exploited."He would also not go there with a bag full of money in order to sway their democratic decision," said Mathabatha.Mathabatha said Tambo would not have used underhanded tactics to remain the leader of the organisation."We must fight corruption because Oliver Tambo hated corruption," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
