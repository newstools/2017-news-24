We know Vietnam was identified at CITES as not yet doing enough," Shaw told AFP, referring to a recent gathering of countries signed up to a key treaty on endangered species."While it's reassuring to see that the decline seems to be continuing, there's a long way to go. We need a long term approach to the challenge," she said.In 2007 just 13 rhino were killed for their horns in South Africa before reaching a peak of 1 215 in 2014, according to the TRAFFIC wildlife trade monitoring group.Rhino horn is composed mainly of keratin, the same substance as in human nails.It is sold in powdered form as a supposed cure for cancer and other diseases.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
