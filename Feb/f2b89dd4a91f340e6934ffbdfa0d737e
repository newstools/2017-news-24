As youth transit from school to the higher education environment, they meet new people and adopt new approaches and habits to personal and sexual relationships at an age where the HIV infection rate is at its highest. The excitement of exploring novel territories is not risk-free though as HIV prevalence among South African women was nearly twice as high as men of the same age. This therefore means that they are vulnerable to acquiring HIV at this pivotal moment in their lives. The national HIV infection rate peaks at the age of 25, hence thefocus of many HIV prevention efforts are people of tertiary education age. The Higher Education and Training HIV/Aids programme (HEAIDS) commences its seventh annual campus-based HIV, STIs, TB and related health and wellness initiative, First Things First. It reaches more than 400 campuses of 76 universities and colleges in the public higher education sector. Last year, students across the country challenged the foundations of the South African higher education system and we know that this process will continue into this academic year, said HEAIDS Director Dr Ramneek Ahluwalia. We recognise that it will impact on campus life. Along with this, students will grapple with their course work. These are doubtlessly major pressures but their health need not be a cause of worry if they are aware of the risk factors.- Supplied. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
