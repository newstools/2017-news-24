I can see columns of smoke," local resident Nuria al-Mosbahi told AFP.Other residents said tanks and trucks mounted with heavy anti-aircraft guns had criss-crossed the zone, leaving behind several burnt-out cars.In the absence of a statement from the Government of National Accord which is based in Tripoli, a leading political figure, Aguila Saleh, issued a condemnation of the violence."What's happening in Tripoli is a terrorist and criminal act which destabilises... citizens and the institutions of state," he said.Libya has been submerged in chaos since the fall and killing of longtime dictator Moammar Gaddafi in a NATO-backed 2011 armed uprising.Rival political authorities and militias have since been vying for control of territory and Libya's oil wealth.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
