He understands the ANC and how it wants to deal with the concerns of the people," Maphatsoe said.Molefe resigned from Eskom in November following public outcry against him following the release of former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s State of Capture report that found he had telephone contact with Ajay Gupta and was in and around the family home in Saxon world.The report revealed that Molefe and Ajay Gupta had made 58 telephone calls to one another between August 2015 and March 2016.It also found that he had been at, or in the vicinity of the Gupta&rsquo;s Saxonwold home on 19 occasions between August 205 and November.A tearful Molefe dismissed the findings and said during a press conference that his cellphone records merely showed he was in the vicinity of the Gupta home."There is a shebeen there, two streets away from the Guptas. I will not admit or deny that I've gone to the shebeen," Molefe said.However he was ridiculed when the shebeen was not found.The MKMVA has maintained that the State of Capture report was politically motivated and says Molefe's past experiences including at Treasury, Public Investment Corporation and Transnet bodes well for a government deployment."That report was just to deal with the credibility of Brian but he is a good comrade who can serve the country well &ndash; wherever he will be deployed," Maphatsoe said.Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has faced a sustained onslaught led by the ANC Youth League. It has called for him to be redeployed, accusing him of protecting the interests of white monopoly capital. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
