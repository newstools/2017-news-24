You won&rsquo;t survive,&rdquo; is the voice message which started doing the rounds at the University of the Free State in Bloemfontein on Tuesday, reported Netwerk24 on Tuesday.&ldquo;We will break windows, doors, trees and I don&rsquo;t know what else. So, if you come here [to the campus], you will die.&rdquo;The voice message added that there would be &ldquo;special forces&rdquo; such as buses to help.&nbsp; &nbsp; It&rsquo;s not known who is speaking or who sent the voice message. &nbsp; UFS spokesperson Lacea Loader said they were aware of the voice message. &ldquo;However, it is difficult to determine where it originated from,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;It could have been recorded at another university or any other place and just spread. It might not even be one of our students.&rdquo; &nbsp; Lectures were disrupted at the agriculture faculty on Tuesday afternoon after about 150 students held a meeting about the registration process. &nbsp; &nbsp; Asive Dlanjwa, a member of the Free Education Movement (FEM), said the students were unhappy that lectures were continuing despite the fact that everyone hadn&rsquo;t been registered yet.&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Most of them applied for assistance from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (Nsfas), but there is a delay.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;The students can&rsquo;t afford to pay for their studies themselves, but they have proof that they did make Nsfas applications. How can they be stopped from attending lectures?&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; The protesting students gathered at the main building of UFS where they aired their displeasure with the tuition issue. &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
