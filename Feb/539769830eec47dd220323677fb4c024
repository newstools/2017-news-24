She surrounds herself with those of the Nzou totem," said Makova.Makova added that it was better in Zanu-PF where they were given letters of expulsion than in Zimbabwe where they would be advised of their dismissal through a press conference.It, however, remained unclear which of the two groups would be organising the party's congress following the split.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
