More terrifyingly, the comments directly incite violence and harm to our children,&rdquo; the TCA said in a statement.The xenophobic comments followed the annual Chinese New Year celebrations on January 28 and Carte Blanche&rsquo;s broadcast the next day of a report on animal abuse and the trade in donkey skins.The TCA said it condemned all illegal activities and cruelty to animals.A TCA delegation told SA Human Rights Commission officials in Braamfontein that it was not the first time they had experienced instances of hate speech.&ldquo;We saw the messages getting louder and louder and it got serious when it started involving children, which is when we decided to raise our voices,&rdquo; TCA chairperson Erwin Pon said.The comments had since been removed from all the Facebook pages at the TCA&rsquo;s request.The SAHRC&rsquo;s chief operations officer Chantal Kisoon told the TCA the investigation of its complaint could take a while.
