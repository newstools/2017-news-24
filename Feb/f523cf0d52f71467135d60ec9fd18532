That issue is foreign to this country," he said after the arrest of two Zambian gay men in 2013.The two men, who faced 14 years in prison if convicted, were acquitted the following year after more than a year in jail.Amnesty International said the accused were subjected to forcible anal examinations by government doctors seeking evidence of sexual activity.Homosexuality is punishable by the death penalty in Mauritania, Sudan and some parts of Nigeria and Somalia, and is also illegal in 30 other African countries.FAZ general secretary Ponga Liwewe said that the association would ensure its new constitution was not against Zambian law, stressing that the document was still at its draft stage."When it is finalised, it will reflect the laws of the country and the law of football so that there will be no conflict between the two," Liwewe told AFP.Human rights campaigners called on FAZ to take a stand against discrimination, with the Engender Rights Centre for Justice group accusing evangelical churches of waging an anti-gay crusade."It is overzealous people, mostly Pentecostal movements, that are misleading the government and the masses," said ERCJ project coordinator Paul Kasonkomona, who was arrested and acquitted four years ago after he appeared on television calling for homosexual relationships to be decriminalised."The constitution says the rights of all should be respected, so let the rights of the minority be respected," he said."I don't think FAZ should feel that they are doing something wrong, they are not asking people to have sex. It's not a sin to be gay."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
