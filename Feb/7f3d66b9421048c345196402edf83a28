Delft police spokesperson Warrant Officer Brian Daniels said officers found the badly burned body of the minor in a hole on an open field.&ldquo;Further investigations revealed that an unknown adult started a fire in the hole and was burning an old mattress and wires.&rdquo; Daniels said the fire was left unattended and a group of minor children were playing on the same field near the open fire. &ldquo;It is alleged that the deceased was playing to near the hole and lost his balance and fell in the fire. He sustained multiple burn wounds and succumbed to his injuries.&rdquo; He said fire and rescue personnel tried in vain to resuscitate the boy after bringing the fire under control, but to no avail. The boy,&nbsp;Asanda Patekile, was identified by his mother.A man who lives a couple of metres from the scene spoke to Tygerburger on condition of anonymity, and said he had seen the children earlier and asked them not to play in the field.&nbsp;"The field is a dump site and very dangerous which is why I asked them to go home and play there, but they never did. I later asked my daughter to go to the shop for me and on her way she ran back home and told me that one of the children fell in the fire. I am devastated that this happened and cannot imagine what his parents must be going through. I urge parents to keep a close eye on their children," he said.&nbsp; Anyone with information is urged to contact the police on 021 954 9085/91.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
