''The smear campaign tactics of the monopoly capital and patriarchist using the neo-liberal media to attack Cde Nomvula is a calculated move to discredit black women in the mass democratic movement and society at large,'' said the league, where Mokonyane is a national executive committee member. ''The vicious character assassination campaign unleashed by these fanatics of patriarchy and racism is driven by hatred towards black women who have earned their stripes to lead in various sectors of society. '' The statement did not say which report in particular, but City Press reported that Mokonyane's department is R3.4b in the red, leaving contractors unpaid and that internal controls, project and contract management had collapsed. But the league said that people saying bad things about &nbsp;her are ''masters and stooges of the narrow capitalist interest that seeks to promote black inferiority and white superiority as an accepted social practice''. Listing her CV and her political achievements, the league said her detractors were trying to subvert her liberation credentials. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
