"Parliament had made a commitment over a number of years to progressively reduce expenditure on SONA through more prudent management and had been succeeding as it reached a R4m mark in 2017."Parliament stated that it was confident that when all bills are paid and everything reconciled, it may be even far less than the target. "Parliament has ensured that high quality and delivery standards of this spectacle event in its corporate events calendar are maintained and improved."Parliament added that SONA pumped millions into the economy of the City of Cape Town and the Province of the Western Cape, "a fact that is regrettably often not acknowledged by critics of Parliament"."A factual study in this regard is being conducted to expose the actual statistical economic impact including tourism, economic development and job creation," it said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
