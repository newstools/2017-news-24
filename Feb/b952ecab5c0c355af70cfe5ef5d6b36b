Mujuru was expelled from Zanu-PF on allegations of plotting to assassinate President Robert Mugabe although she denies the charges.In expelling her lieutenants, Mujuru accused them of working with Mugabe&rsquo;s administration to prolong the nonagenarian&rsquo;s stay in office."As a result, we have decided to eject some of the colleagues and comrades we thought would stand with the people&rsquo;s cause but have chosen to be agents of the regime," said Mujuru.'More heads set to roll'The former vice president accused the expelled of plotting to unseat her ahead of the opposition party&rsquo;s inaugural congress set for next month."All sorts of tricks, ranging from coup d'etat and sophisticated infiltration, have taken centre stage with a view to delaying the people&rsquo;s cause of unequivocal liberation," added Mujuru.Mujuru told journalists that the decision to expel her allies was backed by her party&rsquo;s structures whom she said she consulted, adding that "more heads are going to roll in this revolutionary cleansing exercise".Sources in the opposition party who requested anonymity said Gumbo was now harbouring presidential ambitions resulting in Mujuru clipping his wings."The president (Mujuru) had to clip Gumbo&rsquo;s wings because he was destabilising the party to further his presidential dream. He has been working with his cabal, that includes Mutasa, to undermine Mujuru&rsquo;s authority so that she (Mujuru) would be seen in bad light ahead of our congress," said one source.Editor-in-chief of The Observer newspaper, Barnabas Thondlana, said Mujuru&rsquo;s decision to expel her lieutenants could be a sign that she wants to work with a fresh breed of political leaders of astute character."She has been associated with leaders who have a history of being violent and whose images are tainted. I think she does not want her party to reinvent another administration that is a replica of Zanu-PF," said Thondlana.Efforts to get a comment from the expelled ZimPF leaders were unsuccessful as their mobile phones were not being answered.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
