Close by is Virunga National Park, which features the Mt. Nyiragongo active volcano and some of the world's last lowland gorillas.Julien Paluku Kahongya, governor of North Kivu province, said spreading the message that Goma can host tens of thousands of concert-goers without problems is part of the festival's mission.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
