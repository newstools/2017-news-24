It was followed by retribution killings against Fulanis (known as Peuls in French) accused of being jihadists who had organised the assassination.A report last month by Human Rights Watch described an "Islamist armed group presence and intimidation of the population" that has "steadily increased" in central Mali, as well as an uptick in banditry and criminality.The South African-based Institute for Security Studies has highlighted drought driven by climate change as leaving herders unable to feed their animals in northern Mali, forcing them to move south. They are then "forced into the valleys where conflicts often arise with farmers over land and water," according to a report released last year.Fulani people are frequently accused of colluding with jihadists who have sowed chaos in Mali in recent years, especially in the north but more recently in the centre as well.Since the overthrow of Moammar Gaddafi's regime in Libya, weapons have travelled freely from the chaotic state in an arc of unrest through Mali and Niger.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
