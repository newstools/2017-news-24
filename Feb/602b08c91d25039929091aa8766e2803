Everybody - I'm sticking to that," he told reporters after the Sassa's presentation on Wednesday.The contract with service providers CPS and Net1 was declared invalid by the Constitutional Court in 2014. The court instructed the Department of Social Development to begin a process of insourcing the administrative requirements to handle the distribution all of the country's grants.READ: Sassa wants 'unlawful' grants contract extended, MPs 'staggered'It was revealed in the meeting that Sassa will ask the Constitutional Court to suspend the order by one more year, so that Sassa can finalise its transition plans before 2018.Magwaza said Sassa is still being advised on what to do if the Constitutional Court rejects the application.ResponsibilityHe said during the committee meeting that if he has to choose between the Auditor General's office declaring payments from April 1 "irregular", or the "country burning" because people were not paid, he would rather pay.Magwaza said he could not explain why the process had taken so long, as he only started working in the post on November 1, 2016.Prior to that, however, he had worked in the department's director general's office since 2013. He praised the work of his predecessor Virginia Petersen, despite Sassa's irregular expenditure rising to more than R1bn under her watch in 2015/16.READ: MPs squabble as Dlamini skips crucial Sassa grants meetingHe said he believes there is no-one in his department who needs to answer for Sassa's failure to comply with the Constitutional Court deadline."I'm taking full responsibility for what happens. Right now, I'm satisfied we will be able to pay on April 1."Magwaza also said the South African Post Office, which has 2 700 outlets countrywide, is part of Sassa's long-term plan.Sassa's current service providers have approximately 10 000 pay points across the country.He said Sassa will finalise its options on Monday, and would approach the court this month. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
