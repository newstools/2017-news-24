He also informed them of the consequences when young children accompany strangers to unknown places. The dog and its human partner demonstrated how Bear can find missing people. Some of the children hid behind a building, but thanks to Bear’s excellent sense of smell, he found “the missing children” quickly. - Supplied.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
