He had been in the service for 25 years.In a report on February 10, curator Andre Charl van Heerden said that ABSA had been unable to trace the account number provided by Lamoer.Standard Bank told him that the other account he provided was closed on November 11 last year.Lamoer&rsquo;s FNB account had a debit balance of R1 070.29, while another account was invalid, according to Van Heerden.He put Van der Ross&rsquo;s pension interest under restraint.ABSA said it could not trace Van der Ross&rsquo;s account. His account with FNB had a debit balance of R84.54.The curator said Colin Govender&rsquo;s membership with the Government Employees Pension Fund was terminated in September 2015 and his benefits paid out.&ldquo;I have been advised by Nedbank that his account has a debit balance of R21 498.37.&rdquo;His wife&rsquo;s pension interest was placed under restraint.The restraint order was limited to R179 912 for Dawjee, Towbars Cape CC and Towbars King CC; R75 524 for Lamoer; and R7 324 for Van der Ross.The order against the Govenders, including their interests in annuities and gratuities from their pension fund, was limited to R1.37m.A provisional date for their corruption trial has been set down for April 18.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
