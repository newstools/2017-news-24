The country has been split into two competing parliaments and governments, and each is back by a set of militias, tribes and political factions.In 2015, the United Nations - in an attempt to seal the rift - brokered a peace deal aimed at creating a national unity government. Members arrived in the capital last year but since then have failed to win a crucial vote of confidence from the internationally recognised parliament seated in eastern Libya.Hifter's army is allied with the parliament and has been engaged in a years-long campaign against Islamic militants, mainly in Benghazi but recently across the eastern region, where the forces have taken control over the oil crescent.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
