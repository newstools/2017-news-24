In that way, a specific graph forming part of the family of graphs, is called a Joost graph," he explained.The research was published on March 1, 2016, on asXiv.org, a website run by Cornell University that enables experts in the fields of physics, maths and computer sciences to share their research internationally and to get access to other research papers before they are published.Possible formal publication"Tattooing is a newly-defined graph colouring approach that allows colours to mix as discrete objects within certain mathematical rules."According to Kok, who has a PhD in maths, the colouring problem in graph theory has been researched for many years."In the research paper, we pointed out that the concept of tattooing has several applications, of which several still have to be explored and discovered."He said their paper was submitted to a pre-eminent maths journal for possible formal publication.Kok said mathematical research was what stimulated his mind.He has submitted 70 mathematical research papers in the past five years or so."I could quite easily start working on a paper on Friday and submit it in draft form on the Monday."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
