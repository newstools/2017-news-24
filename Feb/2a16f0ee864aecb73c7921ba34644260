The group cited the example of Marie-Claudette Kwizera, former treasurer of the group Ligue ITEKA, who disappeared in December 2015 and is still missing.Hundreds have died in Burundi since Nkurunziza pursued and won a third term that many said was unconstitutional.Burundi has seen violent street protests, forced disappearances and assassinations since the ruling party announced Nkurunziza's candidacy in April 2015.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
