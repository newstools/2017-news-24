AfriForum's lawyer Willie Spies said Sarah Jane Trent was arrested earlier on Friday afternoon on charges of statutory offence. Spies said Trent was taken by police and driven around in the back of a police van for hours before being taken to Cullinan police station.

He said AfriForum lawyers went to the Cullinan police station in an effort to have her released, and AfriForum was considering taking the matter to the High Court.To recap: On Friday, police officials started raiding forensic investigator Paul O'Sullivan's home in Johannesburg. O'Sullivan told News24 the doorbell rang at his house in Sandton at 16:15. When he opened it, a female metro police officer asked to be let in. She said she needed information on his vehicle, which was apparently involved in a hit and run two weeks ago. He said he told her he sold it about a year ago. O Sullivan said he had a bad feeling about the situation, got into his car and drove away. He said as he left, he saw a convoy of unmarked vehicles coming toward his house. He said the cars tried to block him off but he drove away. He later said his lawyer Sarah Jane Trent had been arrested for allegedly impersonating an Ipid officer and had been taken to the Cullinan police station.I&#39;m told that Sarah Jane Trent #O&#39;Sullivan asst has arrived at North Gauteng High Court to make an urgent application to be released @News24#IPID boss Robert McBride arrives at the North Gauteng High Court @News24 pic.twitter.com/ZFoxS7mf0K Jump to top
