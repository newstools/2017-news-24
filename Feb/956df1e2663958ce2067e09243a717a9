	     Port Elizabeth – Charges of perjury and defeating the ends of justice against Babalwa Breakfast, the girlfriend of the man who allegedly hired hitmen to kidnap and kill Jayde Panayiotou, have been provisionally withdrawn in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court on Friday. Breakfast was arrested in October last year, shortly after she was declared a hostile witness and excused from the stand. She was testifying in the murder trial of Christopher Panayiotou and his two co-accused, Sinethemba Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko. Breakfast, accompanied by her boyfriend Luthando Siyoni, made a brief appearance wherein the director of public prosecutions temporarily withdrew the charges pending the outcome of the main trial. The trial against Panayiotou and his co-accused is scheduled to resume on April 19, 2017.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
