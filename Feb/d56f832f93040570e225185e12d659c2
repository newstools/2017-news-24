They enable us to speak with the voice of the public.&ldquo;They provide us with the ability to identify patterns and hotspots of corruption, to target campaigns, to investigate and to litigate. They constitute the evidence that we present to those in authority,&rdquo; Lewis said. The organisation had made significant inputs into the Protected Disclosures Act in its bid to protect whistle-blowers.Earlier this year, the watchdog was invited to provide public commentary on the Protected Disclosures Amendment Bill by Parliament&rsquo;s select committee on justice and correctional services. It made its submissions to Parliament on February 15.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
