The ANC&rsquo;s historic Polokwane elective conference in 2007 marked the beginning of the decline, he said.President Jacob Zuma was elected ANC leader to replace Thabo Mbeki at the conference.&ldquo;We have trundled aimlessly down the road to societal decline,&rdquo; De Klerk said.State captureThe hostile removal of Thabo Mbeki as president, with the help of former ANC Youth League leader Julius Malema, saw the government jettison policies that had led to economic growth.READ: I am highly critical of President Zuma - FW de KlerkDe Klerk said the investigative unit, the Scorpions, was destroyed, opening the way for the alleged corruption and state capture seen today.Parliament was being used to rubber-stamp the ruling party&rsquo;s decisions, he added.Of concern to him was the racial polarisation the government was propagating, said De Klerk, whose administration enforced separate racial development.He predicted that people's jobs, their land and prospects would in future be defined by their race. Minorities such as whites, Indians and coloureds would be left behind as &ldquo;demographic pens&rdquo; were formed.De Klerk claimed the white population would shrink to its virtual elimination.The ANC's elective conference to be held in December should be closely watched.&ldquo;There are many decent people in the ANC,&rdquo; he said.There would be another crossroads and SA would face three possible directions: A move to socialism, a rush for the gravy train, or a return to the Constitution and values of the ANC's founding fathers.&ldquo;If South Africa fails, Africa fails,&rdquo; De Klerk said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
