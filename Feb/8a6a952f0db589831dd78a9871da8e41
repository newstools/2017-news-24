The sculpture, which stood about 1.5m tall, was stolen in the early hours of the morning.It was the smallest of three bronze effigies representing a family crafted by late sculptor Rhona Gorvy. The stolen statue, with a head resembling a spoon, was the "child" of the family.&nbsp;Bridle said the criminals deserve to be jailed or fined for their actions. "These are irreplaceable pieces of art. Every single one of these is irreplaceable. This one that was stolen now, we can potentially have it forged again, but it's going to take a lot of time and effort to do that," said Bridle. &nbsp; Bridle said in the past two and a half years, two copper water features had also been stolen from outside the restaurant. &nbsp;"Because of the part that has no fencing, we unfortunately have had our two water features stolen. And this started happening about two and a half years ago," said Bridle. An undisclosed amount of money has been offered as a reward to anyone who comes forward with information to help retrieve the statue.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
