Tiyese Jeranji, People's PostRetreat resident Reggie Dreyer's dream will come true after 50 years of waiting to play with the Cape Philharmonic Orchestra. (People's Post) Multimedia &nbsp; &nbsp; User Galleries &nbsp; &nbsp; News in Pictures Send us your pictures &nbsp; &nbsp; Send us your stories Cape Town - A Retreat resident who waited more than 50 years to play with a symphony orchestra will soon have his wish come true. Reggie Dreyer (74) was denied the chance to play because of apartheid law. He is set to perform Piano Concerto no. 23 in A, K. 488 by Mozart with the Cape Philharmonic Orchestra (CPO) at the Artscape Theatre Centre&rsquo;s lunch hour concert next Tuesday. This Mozart classic was the very same piece he auditioned with the orchestra in 1960, but due to apartheid legislation the orchestra could not offer him a place. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s been a long time coming. This has been always my dream since I was young but the judges couldn&rsquo;t listen at that time. So much has happened and it&rsquo;s all now water under the bridge. I&rsquo;m looking forward to playing and I&rsquo;m so happy about it,&rdquo; he says. After three children and seven grandchildren and with old age taking over gracefully, he always knew that one day his dream would finally come true. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to it. One of my daughters is coming from London to see me perform; this means a lot to me. &ldquo;Music has always been my forte. When you get older things change and priorities change. I&rsquo;m fortunate to be able to do this. I have always hoped that it would happen and soon it will happen,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an organist at my church. I love all sorts of music but classic has always been my favourite. It has a way of soothing and calming me down. I really enjoy it.&rdquo; Last year, he was urged to contact the CPO again and he was offered the chance to audition again. Also on the bill next week will be 12-year-old Qden Blaauw from Parow who will play the slow movement of Mozart&rsquo;s Piano Concerto No. 21 in C, K. 467, known as &ldquo;Elvira Madigan&rdquo;. Louis Heyneman, CEO of the CPO, says: &ldquo;With Qden Blaauw the youngest and Reggie Dreyer at the upper end as soloists in the free lunch-hour concert in Artscape&rsquo;s chandelier foyer, there&rsquo;s no doubt that the two organisations are creating a space for everyone.&rdquo; Under the direction of Brandon Phillips, the orchestra will also play a variety of light orchestral pops. Artscape CEO Marlene le Roux says the concert series ties into the theatre complex&rsquo;s objective. &ldquo;Artscape&rsquo;s theatre doors remain open to patrons and stages open to performers who were denied access in the past. Artscape also recognises the immense challenges facing the youth of today, inclusive of socio-economic issues. Through our programmes we can assist in resolving some of these challenges.&rdquo;-&nbsp;@jeranji24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
