"With only one opposition party in place now, I believe that the BDP will have to work very hard in the coming years to preserve or better its supremacy at the 2019 elections," political analyst Anthony Morima was quoted as saying.Khama won a second term in 2014 after his party secured a parliamentary majority at the polls. The BDP garnered at least 29 of the 57 parliamentary seats. The party, however, faced a challenge in urban areas, where opposition parties made inroads since the formation in 2010 of a breakaway party, the Botswana Movement for Democracy (BMD).24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
