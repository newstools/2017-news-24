	     Washington - US President Donald Trump's move to recognise the divided city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital may have triggered a worldwide chorus of critics but the president had his ears closely tuned to his supporters at home. For Trump, the proclamation was an important way to make good on a pledge to his political base, which includes evangelical Christians and pro-Israel Republicans eager for such a move. The president declared on Wednesday that "today, I am delivering". Those were words to savour for a president who's been frustrated to see a number of key campaign pledges stalled or slowed – sometimes by a bitterly divided Congress, some by larger national or international concerns. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
