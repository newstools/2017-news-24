	     Cape Town – Two cousins accused of the murder of Khayelitsha teen Sinoxolo Mafevuka will know their fate within this month. News24 on Friday reported that judgment in the case against Xolisa and Athabile Mafilika was expected to be handed down on December 1. It is, in fact, expected on December 18, the State has clarified. We apologise for the error.

A post-mortem confirmed that she had been strangled. The 19-year-old’s naked body was found slumped over a toilet. Her clothes had been stuffed into the cistern, and water from the leaking toilet is believed to have washed DNA evidence away. Police believe the two accused had been angry after Mafevuka had, days before her murder, left a Khayelitsha tavern with another man. This, while their cousin was making plans to marry her. In October, their application to have the case against them discharged was rejected.

The application was made over apparent contradictory evidence, after the prosecution closed its case against them.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
