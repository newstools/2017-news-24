"We cannot carry on in this way." Mbete closes the issue and they move on to top 6. #ANC54 #ANCVotes @TeamNews24 pic.twitter.com/0rnOPILwtg "Order! Order! Chairperson order!" yells ANCYL #ANC54 #ancvotes @TeamNews24 pic.twitter.com/HlWC9pEOD9 We seeing delegates sleeping on floor. @TeamNews24  #ANCvotes NEC member Toni Yengeni steps up to podium and says the branches have the final say at the conference. They can essentially overrule the electoral commission. Unhappy delegates cheer. #ANC54 #ANCVotes @TeamNews24 Tony Yengeni says they are complicating an easy matter. Says no rule can be imposed on conference & it can reject the rule @TeamNews24  #ANCvotes ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe steps in for Mbete. Reads from the ANC Constitution. The electoral commission has the right to establish the procedure for voting, he declares. #ANC54 #ANCVotes @TeamNews24 Mantashe now steps in & says they must not accuse electoral commission without going to rules. & reads rule that says NEC will appoint electoral commission @TeamNews24  #ANCvotes Mzwandile Masina of Ekurhuleni reads 11.4 of the constitution. @TeamNews24 #ANCvotes Large portion of delegates do not agree with Mfenyana's decision that they will not receive list of names during NEC voting. "All slates must come to an end," he declares. Many delegates not happy. #ANC54 #ANCVotes @TeamNews24 pic.twitter.com/rxIrPipSnD ANC delegates from KZN objects to voting procedures.

Also says they won’t agree with proposed voting system, they want to go with list @TeamNews24 #ANC54 #ANCVotes MP & ANCYL's Desmond Moela also gets up, says branches must vote in accordance with the mandate of their branches. Insisting they must vote with lists to guide them @TeamNews24 Youth League delegate says branches must vote according to the mandate. Matter of saying they must not have list is no right @TeamNews24  #ANCvotes The current disagreement seems to be that some delegates want to be able to review a list of all the nominated NEC members when they vote. Others say no, delegates should be familiar by now and not vote according to slates. #ANC54 #ANCVotes @TeamNews24 Seeing on screen Ex President Kgalema Motlanthe speaking to Smuts Ngonyama @TeamNews24 #ANCvotes Mbete: appeals for tampers to cool @TeamNews24 Mbete appeals to delagtes to listen, says they will give delegates chance and asks them not to shout . @TeamNews24 #ANCvotes
