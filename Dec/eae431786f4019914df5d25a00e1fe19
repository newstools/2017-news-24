	     THE Umzimkhulu Music Experience (#uMME) concept was initiated in 2016 by Makwande Lifestyle Events with the first annual event taking place on December 16, 2016 at Ncalu River Lodge.  The first event was funded completely by Makwande Lifestyle Events, which proved to be a success with 1 650 people paying to attend. A total of 11 local artists and five national artists took part. This year the event is going to be even bigger with big names such as Zakes Bantwini and Duncan billed to perform on the main stage with an expected attendance of 500 people, and artists from the Harry Gwala district will be performing alongside these big names.  THE AIM OF THE UMZIMKHULU MUSIC EXPERIENCE IS TO:  • Provide a tourism initiative that will generate positive economic spin-offs for the various economic sectors of the Umzimkhulu Local Municipality. • To use the #uMME event as a means of marketing tourism offerings of the Umzimkhulu Local Municipality.
