	     Cape Town - A Dutch arms dealer, convicted of selling weapons to former Liberian president Charles Taylor and of crimes against humanity, says his further police detention in Cape Town could prove fatal. Augustinus Petrus Kouwenhoven, 75, says he is so ill that he has about three years left to live. His affidavit containing these details was read out in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Tuesday during a bail application. "My continued detention... could seriously prejudice my health and may even be fatal," Kouwenhoven's affidavit states. It detailed a list of his health issues.
