	     Harare – Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa is on Wednesday
set to deliver his inaugural State of the Nation Address (SONA), reports say. According to the state-owned Herald newspaper, Mnangagwa was expected - during the SONA - to "give his reflection on the country's performance
for the year". The announcement was made by Speaker of the National Assembly
Jacob Mudenda on Tuesday. A NewsDay report said that Mnangagwa's
address to the nation came at a time when there were high expectations in the
southern African country that the president would "tackle the skyrocketing prices of basic
commodities and bring to an end the current cash crisis ahead of the festive
season".  Mnangagwa became
Zimbabwe's president last month after long-time ruler former president Robert
Mugabe stepped down following military intervention. NewsDay said that
Mnangagwa was under pressure to "urgently introduce a raft of measures to
stabilise the economy currently on a tailspin and restore public confidence in
his administration".  In his first speech as president after his inauguration on November
24, Mnangagwa emphasised his and Zanu-PF's new commitment to growing the
economy and creating jobs. "As we focus on recovering our
economy, we must shed misbehaviours and acts of indiscipline which have
characterised the past. Acts of corruption must stop forthwith," Mnangagwa was quoted as saying at the time.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
