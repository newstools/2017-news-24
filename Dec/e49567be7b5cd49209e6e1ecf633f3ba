"Manganyi, together with his accomplice, grabbed Abdulah Hassan Omar, a 27-year-old spaza shop owner at Hlanganani RDP Section, forced him into his room, where there were three other victims, and held them hostage. The two suspects took an amount of R3 000 before fleeing the scene on foot," said Mojapelo. Firearm linked to crime Mojapelo added that evidence collected at the crime scene and the results of forensic investigations led to Manganyi's arrest. His firearm was also linked to the crime through ballistic examination, said Mojapelo. "His failure to cooperate with police investigations in revealing the identity of his accomplice did not spare him any moment as he was ultimately convicted and sentenced alone for the murder of Mr Omar," he said.
