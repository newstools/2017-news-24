 A YOUNG Humpback whale washed up on Blythedale beach early on Thursday morning. The whale calf of approximately 5.5 to 6 metres was found on the beach with no visible signs of injuries, according to IPSS Medical Rescue personnel who were on scene. “There were no marks found on the carcass,” said IPSS spokesperson Paul Herbst. The cause of the whales death is unknown. Quentin Power of the Specialised Rescue Unit and the KZN Stranding Network told media that their initial plan was to float the carcass back out to sea to allow for natural decomposition. However, due to the proximity of the calf to the rocks, they were not able to do so. According to a Sharks Board spokesperson, the whale would have been migrating back to the Antarctic. “Whales migrate to colder waters to follow food sources. If the calf was too weak to complete the journey it would have been left behind by the mother,” said the spokesperson. While authorities were on scene, locals arrived and began carving the whale for its meat.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
