	     Johannesburg - DRUM has obtained footage of a woman protecting her handbag during an altercation with a mugger in Westdene, Johannesburg on Saturday. According to the owner of the footage – who has asked not to be named – the suspect fled after being challenged by the victim. She suffered an injury to her left hand and looked to be in her late twenties. "We were sitting inside when it happened," the witness said. "She (the victim) is tiny – she fought like you cannot believe. She was so shocked!" Another woman, who was busy gardening a few houses down the road, attempted to stop the man from running off by throwing a plant at him, but he still managed to escape. The Sophiatown police station has stated that the incident went unreported.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
