His funeral was attended by ANC members, friends and family in Shayamoya township last Saturday. He joined the ANC in 2004 and participated in many campaigns as a volunteer. At the service ANC branch treasurer Ndumiso Figlan described Mandla as a “good man who played a huge role in the programmes of the ruling party”. “ANC has lost a dedicated comrade who loved working for people without expecting any income. He died at a time when the party is preparing for the 2019 general elections where he was to take part in campaigns,” said Figlan. Party member Nombuso Mtolo said the party has lost a “humble and passionate member”. Banele’s father Solomon Mandla said his son loved playing soccer and running. He leaves two children.
