	     Johannesburg – The Tembisa Magistrate’s Court sentenced three men to lengthy terms of imprisonment on Tuesday for their involvement in hijacking-related crimes, Ivory Park police said on Wednesday. Thirty-six-year-old Jabu Sithole and 33-year-old Sibusiso Ndlovu were each sentenced to 50 years’ imprisonment, while 31-year old Muzi Hlatshwayo, was sentenced to 25 years.They were sentenced for a range of charges including hijacking, attempted murder, business robbery, possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, and kidnapping.The three men, who will start serving their sentences this month, are from Tembisa, just outside Midrand and are all repeat offenders who have committed crimes in the East Rand township.The men were arrested in August 2015, shortly after hijacking and kidnapping a woman at gunpoint in Ebony Park, Midrand.One suspect is still at large."Police began searching for the vehicle as per specifications given to them. They came across the vehicle, gave chase, and ended up recovering the vehicle, two firearms, arresting three of the four suspects and rescuing the victim," read a statement.Ivory Park's Brigadier David Ngcobo said the sentences were appropriate and added that he hoped it would serve as a deterrent to other criminals as well as the fourth suspect.“Hopefully the community of Ivory Park, Tembisa and the adjacent areas will breathe a sigh of relief. Credit must be given to the members whose quick response led to the speedy arrest and to the detective officer whose tireless efforts resulted in the conviction," said Ngcobo. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
