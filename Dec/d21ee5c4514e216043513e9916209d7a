	     East London - A joint operation between police units in the
East London area has resulted in the seizure of 85kg of dagga and the arrest of
a man for dealing in drugs. Police spokesperson Warrant Officer Hazel Mqala said the
Mdantsane flying squad, East London flying squad, East London K9 unit and the
Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations had partnered up as part of
festive season operations. Mqala said the operation had acted on crime intelligence and
had entered Needs Camp, where a number of addresses had been visited. This led to the discovery of 10 large bags of dagga,
weighing 85kg, as well as the arrest of a 56-year-old man for dealing in dagga. Mqala said the man would appear in the East London
Magistrate's Court soon. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
