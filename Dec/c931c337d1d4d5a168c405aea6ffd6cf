	     Johannesburg – Fourteen teachers resigned in the space of 12 months after they were allegedly victimised by the principal at Bryneven Primary School, in Bryanston, north of Johannesburg, the Gauteng education department said on Tuesday.  Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi met with parents, teachers and the school management team on Tuesday morning.  Lesufi's visit to the school came after a protest by parents earlier on Tuesday outside the school demanding the removal of the principal.  Gauteng education spokesperson Steve Mabona said parents had accused the principal of corruption and fraud, including the mismanagement of funds, and nepotism.    Mabona said parents also complained about a Grade 2 Afrikaans teacher who was not proficient in the language.  He added that the department had appointed an independent firm to conduct an audit of the school's financial records for the past three years.  The outcome of the audit is expected in February 2018 and will assist in providing the department with clarity on allegations of mismanagement of funds.  Following the meeting on Tuesday, he said the following actions would be taken at the school: 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
