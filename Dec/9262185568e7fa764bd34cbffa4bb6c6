	     Bulawayo - At least 20 000 people died when former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe ordered a military campaign against the rival liberation movement, Zapu. An unknown number of civilians were among the dead in a series of massacres between 1983 and 1987. The new president, Emerson Mnangagwa, and former military chiefs appointed to his cabinet are implicated in the events. Al Jazeera's Andrew Simmons reports from Matabeleland.
