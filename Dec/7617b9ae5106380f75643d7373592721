RNM Mayor Nomusa Mqwebu said some South Coasters have said there is no need for the law enforcement section and it should be disbanded. She said the department management also complained that traffic officers are not trained and can’t confidently enforce the law. There were complaints that the existing by-laws are not adequate. “In light of this, council resolved to mandate the head of Department of Public Safety to ensure that traffic wardens are properly trained and by-laws are passed,” The certification will allow officers to receive an infrastructure number, thereby paving the way for them to be registered on the national database of traffic officials, which means they are certified to practice anywhere in the coun-       try. “Moreover, the certification puts you in a position to be able to enforce offences such as those which relate to Section 56 without fear of your decisions being challenged in a court of law,” said Mqwebu. She also expressed confidence that since officers had been trained it will boost the public morale in the work of officers. “I think it should also boost your confidence to know you are entitled to enforce the law,” Mqwebu added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
