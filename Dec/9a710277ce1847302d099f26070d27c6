FROM November 20 to 24, government officials­ visited schools and the communities Gqumeni under Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma Municipality in a campaign to educate them about their rights as part the 16 Days of Activism Against Women and Children Abuse campaign.  Government departments including Department of Health, Social Development, SAPS, Justice and Constitutional Development and municipal officials attended.  Basil Ntshiza, Sukuma Sakhe chairperson in the Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma Municipality said pupils who become victims of abuse do not report abusers because of threats and a lack of knowledge. He said abusers deserve to pay for their evil actions. “The municipality is working with several­ stakeholders to reach many communities and schools and educate them because we want victims of abuse to know where to report the abuse and get help,” said Ntshiza. He said the municipality is also educating people on how to treat disabled people with respect. - Supplied. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
