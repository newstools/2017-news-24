Read: Extending liquor trading hours was never our idea - ANC The conference will be held at the Nasrec Expo Centre between December 16 and 20. "As far as we are concerned, scores of delegates, including dignitaries, international guests and foreign media will flock to Gauteng this week ahead of the ANC’s 54th National Conference," he said. "The conference will bring some economic spin-offs, especially for the hospitality sector. Liquor trading hours will not be extended, even though by law we have the discretion to do so." Outlets that sold liquor illegally during the conference would "face the wrath of the law", Maile said. He said inspectors would be on the look-out and work closely with law enforcement agencies. "We will be conducting impromptu raids to monitor all outlets." he said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
