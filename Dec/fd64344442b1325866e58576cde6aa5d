	     Boston — Two men convicted of killing a rival gang member as he shovelled snow in Boston for a non-profit organisation that steers young people away from crime have been sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 20 years. The Suffolk district attorney's office says 27-year-old Donte Henley and 21-year-old Josiah Zachery were sentenced on Monday. The men were found guilty of murder last week in the February 2015 shooting of 21-year-old Kenny Lamour. Prosecutors say the men were on a snow shovelling crew overseen by Roca Inc. They assured their supervisor they could work together peacefully. Prosecutors say Henley texted a description of Lamour and their location to Zachery, who came and fatally shot Lamour. The defence argued Henley's texts were misconstrued and no witnesses identified Zachery as the shooter.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
