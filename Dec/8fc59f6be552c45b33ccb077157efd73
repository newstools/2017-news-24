Derrick Spies, Correspondent Durban - Thirteen people were injured and traffic seriously delayed, when a vehicle collided head on with a full taxi on Saturday morning. Crisis Medical spokesperson Kyle van Reenen said the accident happened in Durban North, on the M4 Ruth First Highway, just after Broadway.  "A single light motor vehicle careened over the centre median, colliding head on with a fully laden minibus taxi," he said.  The M4 north bound remained closed for over an hour whilst emergency services worked to clear the scene. Van Reenen said 13 people had suffered injuries ranging from minor to critical.   "Five people were entrapped in the wreckage and the Jaws of Life were used to cut them free," he said. He said once they were treated and stabilised on the scene, the injured were taken by various ambulances to nearby hospitals for further care. Fire & Rescue had to use the "Jaws of Life" to rescue injured from taxi. (Supplied, Netcare 911) Traffic had been affected.
