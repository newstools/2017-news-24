	     Johannesburg – Police have arrested six men in the parking area outside Nasrec, in Johannesburg, where the ANC's national conference is being held. National police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said police were conducting routine patrols outside the venue on Saturday, when they came across the six men drinking in the parking area. "On Saturday afternoon our officers were just conducting patrols in the parking lot outside the conference centre. They noticed six men consuming alcohol, so when they confronted them they discovered they were in possession of a firearm that was reported stolen in Kliptown," Naidoo said.  He said the owner of the firearm was from Pinetown in KwaZulu-Natal. Naidoo said the men were arrested and were expected to appear in court on Monday on charges relating to the possession of a stolen firearm.
