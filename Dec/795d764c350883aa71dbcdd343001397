	     Pretoria – The Presidency announced on Friday that it would
appeal a judgment by the North Gauteng High Court seeking the removal of the
current National Director of Public Prosecutions.  "Whilst the President awaits a full briefing on the
judgement, he has been advised that an early assessment displays, with respect,
various grounds upon which a successful appeal may be prosecuted," the
Presidency said in a statement. Earlier, the court ruled that Advocate Shaun Abrahams must
vacate his seat as NDPP. Judge Dunstan Mlambo further ruled it would not be just for
the former prosecutions boss Mxolisi Nxasana to be reinstated and that due to
his pending corruption case, President Jacob Zuma was conflicted in appointing
an NDPP. Mlambo has ruled that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa must
appoint a new NDPP in the next 60 days. Freedom Under Law, Corruption Watch and the Council for the
Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac) had gone to court seeking
an order declaring Nxasana’s removal invalid. - Read more: Ramaphosa must appoint new NPA head "The National Prosecuting Authority is an important
institution in our constitutional democracy, appointments in respect of which
are not made lightly," the Presidency said. "Together with judges, who likewise are appointed by
the President, the National Director of Public Prosecutions plays a vital role
in the criminal justice system. Minded by the principle of the separation of
powers, constitutional legality and the rule of law, the judgement will be
appealed. "Out of deference to the court and the judicial system,
these grounds will be properly ventilated in the normal course in court
proceedings."  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
