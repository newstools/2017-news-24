The Columbus Dispatch reports 60-year-old Daniel Slyby, of Gahanna, must post a $64 000 bond by December 30 or his cats will be permanently forfeited to a Columbus animal welfare organisation. Slyby was charged with 11 counts of animal cruelty on Wednesday in Franklin County Municipal Court. Columbus Humane, which conducts animal cruelty investigations, says the cats were found living in deplorable conditions when they were removed from Slyby's home last week. All but one of the cats is receiving care at Columbus Humane's shelter. One cat had to be euthanased. Slyby's attorney, Tony Clymer, said on Thursday that Slyby denies having mistreated his cats. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
