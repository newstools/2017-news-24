	     Cape Town – The City of Cape Town has issued an advisory to residents urging them to ensure that their neighbourhoods do not become "fast food outlets" for baboons.  In a statement, the city's biodiversity manager Julia Wood said during the festive season people generate significant additional waste which attracts animals, especially baboons, to neighbourhoods.  "As the City of Cape Town, we need the public to support and work with us to create baboon-free residential areas, and achieving this requires the cooperation of every resident," Wood said.  Wood advised residents to:  Wood reminded Capetonians that baboons are protected species in the Western Cape according to the CapeNature Conservation Laws Amendment Act, 2000, Ordinance 19 of 1974. The law prohibits the feeding, killing, injuring and hunting of baboons.  "All such offences are punishable by law and carry stiff penalties. Residents are encouraged to report any tip-offs regarding transgressions, or any other baboon-related incidents, to the baboon helpline," Wood said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
