	     Cape Town – Western Cape police commended a taxi driver on Tuesday for his kindness when he stopped to assist two children "wandering aimlessly" along the side of a busy freeway. In a statement, police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut said Mbulelo Mngqenge had been driving along the N2 when he spotted the children - a boy aged four and a girl aged 14 on the side of the road. He stopped, picked them up and drove them to the Nyanga police station, Traut said. "In a province where the safety of children remains a sore point, one can only commend Mr Mngqenge for diverting from his daily taxi routine to see the [children] were in safe hands." Traut said, since Mngqenge dropped off the children, a social worker managed to reunite the boy with his family. The girl is recovering at Groote Schuur Hospital. Details of her condition are unknown. Traut added that police were grateful for the Mngqenge's compassion and said they hoped it would inspire others. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
