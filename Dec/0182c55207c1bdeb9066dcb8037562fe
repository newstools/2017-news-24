	     Cairo - Egyptian security forces killed five militants when they raided a hideout in a suburb north of Cairo on Monday, the interior ministry said in a statement. Security forces have been battling an insurgency by an Islamic State group affiliate based in North Sinai since the military's 2013 ouster of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi and the crackdown on his supporters that followed. Most of the violence has been in North Sinai province, but there have also been attacks on the military, police and even churches elsewhere, including Cairo. The ministry said the five were hiding out at a construction site in Obour City, a suburb some 30 kilometres (18 miles) northeast of Cairo, along with weapons and ammunition. It said they had been planning "a series of hostile operations against important and vital buildings and Christian places of worship". Security forces returned fire after the militants shot at them, the ministry said. Security forces also arrested 10 people in hideouts in Qalyubia province north of Cairo, and in Alexandria province. Investigations revealed that "some of these elements received financial support from terrorist leaders hiding in North Sinai", the ministry said. Security forces also raided a farm in El-Wadi el-Gedid province in southwest Egypt, which was used as a weapons training area, and made one arrest. In January, gunmen killed eight policemen in an attack on a checkpoint in the province. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
