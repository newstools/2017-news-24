Siphelele Nketo SHACK dwellers in Marikana in Kokstad are living in fear after criminals stole valuables and threatened community members who fight against crime in their area.  As a result of the high crime rate the community have organised a meeting with police to address the problem tomorrow. Chairperson of the local community policing forum (CPF) Sinethemba Mdikeli said people have sleepless nights because of high crime rate and criminals are targeting women who live alone.  He says criminals use bush knives and knives to threaten the community.  “Last Sunday, criminals demanded two cases of beer from one of the shop owners in Marikana and they ran away when the community intervened to rescue the shop owner. Crime is out of control,” said Mdikeli.  People have requested street lights to be erected as a crime deterrent. Mdikeli said many cases of housebreakings have been reported to the police, who are struggling to make arrests. People says criminals are stealing valuable items to buy drugs.  SAPS spokesperson Captain Dumisani Ncongo said many housebreaking cases have been opened in Kokstad. He said SAPS are searching for criminals after a housebreaking was reported in Shayamoya last Friday and a TV, cellphones and a laptop were stolen. He called on people to strengthen security in their home, especially over the festive season. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
