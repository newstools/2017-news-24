She is the second person to face punishment for the murder following the conviction of 39-year-old Jwayelile Khuboni, who received a life sentence in the High Court in Pietermaritzburg earlier this month. Police said Dlamini left her Donnybrook home on September 7 with the women. 'Both arms and head missing' "She never came back home. The next day the family became worried and started to look for her but could not find her," Zwane said. The matter was reported to the local police and a search was conducted with the help of residents. Her body was found on September 10 on the side of the road at Sunrise Forest, in Donnybrook.

The suspect was charged accordingly and taken to court."   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
