	     Kampala - Six Ugandan opposition lawmakers have been suspended from the legislature amid heated debate over a bill to abolish the presidential age limit. The lawmakers were suspended on Monday for allegedly disobeying the speaker's orders when they persistently questioned her decisions. Most other opposition lawmakers briefly walked out of the chamber, saying they wanted to consult, but later returned. The controversial bill seeks to jettison a constitutional clause that prevents anyone above 75 from being president. Critics say the bill would allow President Yoweri Museveni, who is 73 and ineligible to run again, extend his rule, possibly for life. Museveni has ruled since 1986. Uganda's ruling party has an overwhelming majority in Parliament and the bill is expected to pass when it is put to a vote. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
