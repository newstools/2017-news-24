	     Johannesburg – ANC members from Limpopo who form part of the mysterious 60-plus delegates whose votes were not counted during voting in the party's elective conference are expected to meet with officials at Luthuli House on Friday. Their lawyer Dexter Selepe told News24 on Thursday that his clients would be meeting with Luthuli House on Friday after threatening legal action against the ANC. "Their demand is very simple. All they are saying is 'my vote should be counted'," Selepe said. On Wednesday, the final day of the ANC elective conference in Johannesburg, the delegates gave the ANC until the end of the conference to respond. Selepe said he would be speaking to his clients on Thursday afternoon before they meet at Luthuli House on Friday. His clients want their votes included, with the hope that their number would overturn former KwaZulu-Natal premier and provincial chair Senzo Mchunu's loss to Free State Premier Ace Magashule in the race for the position of secretary-general. Magashule beat Mchunu by 24 votes. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
