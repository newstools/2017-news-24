	     Harare - A Roman Catholic priest who brokered Robert Mugabe’s
resignation last month says the former president’s wife will face justice in
the future. In an interview with America magazine, a Catholic journal,
Father Fidelis Mukonori said justice would likely be served on Grace Mugabe
after Mugabe dies. “I’m sure that people would do justice to her,” was the
priest’s brief response in an interview with the magazine when asked what would
happen to the former first lady after her husband dies. Deeply unpopular Grace was aligned to a faction of young
ambitious officials vying to take over control of Zanu-PF after Mugabe. She got
Emmerson Mnangagwa sacked as vice president last month. The move triggered a
backlash from the military, who seized control of the party and forced Mugabe
to resign. Although Grace Mugabe appears to have received immunity
under a deal brokered partly by Mukonori last month, the same can’t be said for
her main political allies. Most have been arrested and charged with criminal
offences, or have fled the country. Grace Mugabe is understood to have left Zimbabwe last week
in the company of her husband and other family members for their annual family
holiday in Singapore. It is not clear when they will return to Zimbabwe. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
