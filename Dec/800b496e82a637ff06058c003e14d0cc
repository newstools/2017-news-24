	     Chicago - A 34-year-old California man has been charged after authorities say he told an airline employee at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport there was a bomb in his carry-on bag. The Chicago Sun-Times reports that police found no bomb and charged Otis Evans of San Diego with felony disorderly conduct. Evans was escorted from the plane about 13:00 on Friday. Chicago police said in a statement that the incident caused a "large law enforcement and fire personnel response which resulted in evacuations and delayed flights". A police spokesperson said the area was searched and found to be safe. Evans was expected to appear in court on Saturday. It's not clear if he has an attorney to comment on his behalf. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
