	     Cape Town - The body of a teenager, who had been reported missing, was found buried in a bush along Symphony Way in Delft, Cape Town, on Wednesday. Western Cape police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said officers were called to the scene when someone discovered a hand "sticking [out] from a grave". The body of a 14-year-old boy was exhumed. It had a wound on the side of the head and the face was swollen, Van Wyk confirmed. "The deceased was identified by his grandmother who had reported him missing [on Tuesday] night," he said. Police launched a search after being informed that his family could not find him. The victim is from Delft South. The motive for the murder is unknown and no arrests have been made, Van Wyk said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
