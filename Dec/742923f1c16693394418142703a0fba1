	     Johannesburg – A domestic worker was murdered in Littleton, Pretoria while her employers were away on holiday, police said on Friday. It is suspected that she had been stabbed with a sharp object that was recovered at the scene, police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela said. "The deceased was discovered by her employers, who had been away on holiday since last Friday," he said. Cases of murder and house robbery are being investigated since it is alleged that both a laptop and tablet were stolen from the house, said Mavimbela. "The police are optimistic that the circumstances surrounding the incident will be revealed soon," he said. He said Tshwane Central Cluster police have given an undertaking to prevent serious and violent crimes, and crimes against women and children, "which entails the incarceration of the alleged perpetrators with the aim to prevent the crimes from recurring".  "This case is not an exception. The suspect has to be brought to book," he said. Mavimbela urged anyone with an information that could lead to the speedy arrest of the suspect to contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or to send an anonymous SMS to Crime Line at 32211. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
