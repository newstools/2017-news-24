	     Monrovia - Liberia's National Elections Commission is expected to begin releasing provisional results Wednesday from the west African nation's presidential runoff. State radio correspondents reported unofficial results overnight but authorities warned the two parties to "stop making premature pronouncements". This is the first time in more than 70 years the nation founded by freed American slaves will see one democratically elected government hand power to another. Nearly 2.2 million voters were choosing between 51-year-old former soccer star George Weah and 73-year-old Vice President Joseph Boakai. The winner will replace Africa's first female head of state, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who is stepping down after two terms. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
