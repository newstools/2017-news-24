	     Johannesburg – The ANC must take heed from court judgments against the party and its President Jacob Zuma, North West chairperson Supra Mahumapelo said on Thursday.  On Wednesday a full Bench of the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria delivered two damning judgments against Zuma. First, the court ordered that he personally pay for legal costs in an application he had lodged to stop the release of former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela’s report on state capture allegations. Later, it ruled that Madonsela's recommended remedial actions after her investigation into state capture were wise, necessary, rational and appropriate. The full Bench, led by Judge President Dunstan Mlambo, dismissed Zuma's application to have aspects of Madonsela's report taken on review. Strengthening democracy Commenting on the outcomes, Mahumapelo said: "We must celebrate the strengthening of democracy in SA. When courts take such decisions against the head of state… it's part of strengthening democracy." He said the courts should continue to play their role in all issues brought before them, despite the positions carried by people involved. Mahumapelo added that it was positive that the courts were fearless. “I don’t think its damning, [it's] just a normal judgment like any other judgments we have in the country,” Mahumapelo said. He added that the courts were implementing their mandate without fear or favour. Mahumapelo said the liberation movement should look at past judgments as it seeks to pave a way forward.
