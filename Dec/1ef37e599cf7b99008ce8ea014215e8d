	     SABC employees gathered outside the SABC offices to strike for a 10% wage increase on Thursday morning in Johannesburg. Hundreds of workers, who are affiliated with the Communications Workers’ Union (CWU) and the Broadcasting, Electronic, Media and Allied Workers Union (Bemawu) took part in the strike after the SABC said they should only expect an increase of 4.5%. The protesters were seen holding placards written “Thieves” and “10% increase”. In a statement issued by SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago on Monday, the SABC said they met with Bemawu and CWU to discuss the revised salary increase and that both unions were offered a 4.5% increase which would be applicable for the last six months of the financial year of 2017/2018. Both unions declined the 4.5% offer, which resulted in a strike action at the SABC headquarters on Thursday. The strike coincides with the broadcast of the 54TH National Conference of the ANC, which kicks off on Saturday. Kganyago couldn’t be reached for comment today.
