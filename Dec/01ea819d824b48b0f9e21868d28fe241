	     When it comes to prophets, South Africa has had its fair share of scandalous ones. From pastors who feed rats to their congregants to those who claim they can cure HIV/Aids. And Malawian-born prophet Shepherd Bushiri is no stranger to controversies.  The Major 1 now has everyone talking about the ticket prices for his gala dinner that will be held on 23 December at the Pretoria Showgrounds.  The cost for a seat at a table ranges from R1 000-R25 000, depending on where one would like to be seated. Social media users found these prices ridiculously high and have taken to Facebook and Twitter to share their thoughts.  Do you agree that the price is too high or is it just right to be seated next to the Major 1?  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
