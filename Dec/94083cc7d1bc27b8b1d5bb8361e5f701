	     Burgersfort – Police in Limpopo have arrested the wife of a teacher and two other men in connection with his murder in August. Limpopo police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the teacher's wife, 37, her boyfriend, 42, and the alleged hitman, 34, were arrested this week. Daniel Ramaipadi, 53, a teacher and head of department at a local school, was gunned down by unknown men at his home in Ga-Motodi village outside Burgersfort in August. His car was also taken but was later recovered near the scene of the murder. Ngoepe said in a statement that the three were arrested in what was a "consistent and relentless effort to fight serious and violent crimes" by a special task team made up of the elite provincial tracking team, provincial detectives and provincial crime intelligence. Ngoepe said Ramaipadi's wife, Vuyela, 37, had already appeared before the Praktiseer Magistrate's Court on a charge of murder. Bail was denied and she is expected to appear again next week. Her two accomplices will appear before the same court on Thursday. Ngoepe said investigations were continuing. He said acting provincial commissioner Major General Bafana Linda praised the team for their hard work. "Anyone who still engages in any form of criminal conduct, including this type of the planned heinous acts, their days are numbered," Linda said. "We believe that this great achievement will bring closure to the family, relatives and friends." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
