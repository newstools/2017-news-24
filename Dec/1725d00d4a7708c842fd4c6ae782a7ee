	     Cairo - Egypt's Interior Ministry says security forces have killed five suspected militants in a shootout in a province about 150km east of Cairo. It says in a statement on Monday police have arrested another six militants in follow up raids on a desert area in the Sharqiya province. It adds police found bomb-making materials, assault rifles and ammunition at the site. Egypt's military and security forces have been waging a yearslong campaign against militants, mainly in the northern region of the Sinai peninsula - where Islamic extremists carried out the country's deadliest attack last month, killing 305 people - and the country has been in a state of emergency for months. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
