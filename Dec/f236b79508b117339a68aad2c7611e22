	     Harare – Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party is gearing up for its extraordinary
congress that is set to take place on Friday in Harare. The congress would see President Emmerson Mnangagwa being
endorsed as the party leader by the country’s 10 provinces. The state-owned Herald newspaper, reported on Tuesday that the aim of the congress would
be to "endorse changes that came up as a result
of Operation Restore Legacy that helped stop ruinous divisions in the
revolutionary party".  The report quoted Zanu-PF spokesperson Simon Khaya Moyo as
saying that the revolutionary party was "ready to roar and would emerge stronger
after the congress ahead of the 2018 harmonised elections". Zanu-PF announced recently that Mnangagwa
would be the party's preferred candidate in the 2018 elections. The congress was initially scheduled to confirm former president Robert Mugabe
as Zanu-PF’s candidate for next year’s elections. It was also meant to provide
a platform for the rise of his wife Grace Mugabe to the position of
vice-president, putting her in line to succeed her husband. But the tide had since changed, and war veterans and military strongmen were
now expected to get influential posts within the party.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
