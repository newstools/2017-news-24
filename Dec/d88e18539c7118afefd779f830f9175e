	     Cape Town – The domestic worker of an Alabama, Klerksdorp, couple has been arrested after a neighbour found the man and woman dead in their home on Thursday. North West police confirmed the arrest of the 45-year-old woman who is expected to appear in the local magistrate's court on two murder charges. A neighbour noticed the couple's security gate windows were open at 22:00 and called to them over the fence, authorities confirmed in a statement. When he received no answer, he went to the house, where he found the 60-year-old man in a pool of blood while his 56-year-old wife was in their bedroom and appeared to have been strangled. Police investigations resulted in the domestic worker's arrest. An undisclosed amount of cash and cellphones were stolen from the house. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Baile Motswenyane condemned the "ruthless" incident and said police would ensure that the remaining suspects were arrested. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
