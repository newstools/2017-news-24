Durban mother is seeking justice for the alleged murder of her 34-year-old
daughter, Nisha Wentzel. Nisha
was found dead in her home in Middelburg in Mpumalanga on 18 November, in what
appeared to have been a suicide.  Convinced
her daughter, a three-time cancer survivor, would never attempt to end her
life, her mother Rose Henry dug deeper, soliciting the help of KTT forensic
investigators. Nisha’s
husband, Shane Wentzel, has now been implicated in the crime.  According
to The Middelburg Observer, postmortem results
reveal that Nisha died in a “much more violent way”. The publication reports
that “she had a cracked skull, broken ribs and strangulation marks around her
neck”. Shane
(also 34) is currently in police custody after appearing in the Middelburg High
Court on 11 December. According
to The Post, Nisha’s mother Rose said
the couple got engaged only a week after knowing each other and married a few
weeks later back in 2005. Nisha had met Shane after moving to Mpumalanga from
Durban where she worked as a hairdresser. She was only 21 at the time. Rose
told the Post that she was concerned about Shane’s aloof behaviour, when she
visited her daughter and son-in-law earlier this year but Nisha brushed it off,
telling her not to worry but later confessed about their problems and that she
wanted out of the marriage. The
paper goes on to report that Shane knew about her plans to file for a divorce. It
was through the evidence gathered including, a letter from lawyers confirming
Nisha was seeking a divorce and images of the injuries to Nisha’s body that the
police re-opened the case. The
Post reports that Shane’s family declined to comment. He is due back in court
in January. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
