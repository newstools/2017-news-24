Spaniard Francisco Núñez Olivera, who holds the title of being the world’s oldest man, credits his longevity to “good genes”. It’s clearly in the genes as his younger siblings are aged 93 and 95. While his sons have passed on his daughters, Maria Antonia (82) and Milagros (78), take care of him. Born in a small village in Extremadura, Spain, Francisco is a retired farmer and war veteran. He fought against the Berbers in the 1920s during the Rif War between Spain and Morocco. He became the oldest person in the world in August when Yisrael Kristal, a holocaust survivor died at the age of 113, according to Metro. The father of four children, grandfather of nine and great-grandfather of 15 is affectionately known as Marchena. He added that another secret to longevity is “to work hard. To not be weak and stay in the house”.  Maria Antonia added further explanations for her father’s advanced age, including “a gentle routine in a quiet village, being his own boss, not arguing with the family and enjoying the good life – that revolved around the field, his house and the village bar”. Francisco is in good health despite complications suffered in earlier years. He had a kidney removed when he was 90, a cataract operation when he was 98 and was hospitalised after a urinary tract infection when he was 108. He claims to have never broken a bone and has perfect blood pressure. Sources: Metro, The Local Spain, The Sun 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
