	     Johannesburg - Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa is in South Africa on his first foreign trip as head of state, visiting a country where he sought refuge after being fired as deputy president early last month. Mnangagwa traveled to South Africa on Thursday to persuade investors that economically struggling Zimbabwe is an attractive business prospect after the November 21 resignation of former leader Robert Mugabe, whose 37-year rule ended after a military takeover. The African News Agency says Mnangagwa met South African President Jacob Zuma and remarked that he was happy to be back in the country. Mnangagwa fled to South Africa after Mugabe dismissed him during factional fighting in Zimbabwe's ruling party. The firing prompted a backlash against Mugabe and Mnangagwa returned to Zimbabwe, where he was sworn in as president. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
