 FARM workers and the owners of the Shortlands Riding Centre are still in shock after an employee was shot dead at the farm on Sunday, December 10.  Mike Mpachika (27), sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the arm, abdomen and head.  It’s alleged that four suspects, posing as police officers, arrived at farm at 11pm on Sunday and demanded to see Mpachika.  According to information from Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) and SAPS provincial office, the suspects were wearing police uniforms and driving a Chevrolet vehicle fitted with blue lights.  Head of Rusa Prem Balram said upon arrival it was established that the suspects were driving a Chevrolet.  “The four men made their way to the victim’s room where an argument broke out regarding the services of a traditional healer.  “It is alleged the suspects demanded money from the victim when he attempted to flee.  “The victim was then shot three times, once in the head and twice in the body.” The suspects fled the scene in their gateway vehicle in an unknown direction.  Paramedics stabilised the critically injured man before transporting him to hospital, where he later died.  “According to witnesses the suspect’s vehicle was fitted with flashing blue lights,” Balram said.  Ann Oliff, who identified herself as one of the owners at the estate, confirmed that Mpachika worked for them. “I cannot divulge all the details right now, but what I know is that he was one of our employees.  “I am not sure if he was a traditional healer.”  KZN police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “A case of murder is being investigated by Tongaat SAPS.  “The deceased is suspected to be a traditional healer. The motive for the attack is still unknown.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
