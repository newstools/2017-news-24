	     Cape Town - The man who allegedly shot and killed Cape Town businesswoman Unathi
Sabsana in front of her family has handed himself over to police, Western Cape
police said on Sunday. The 27-year-old man handed himself over at the Gugulethu
police station in Cape Town on Saturday "when he realised police were hot
on his heels", said Brigadier Novela Potelwa. The man, whose identity is known to News24, cannot be named
until he has appeared in court. Potelwa said the man had been on the run since the shooting
of Sabsana, aged 28, last Monday. He faced a slew of other criminal cases against him,
according to the police. At the time of the murder, he was out on bail in connection
with a house robbery in Gugulethu. He was also due in court the day after the murder, last
Tuesday, in connection with a domestic violence case involving Sabsana. Last Wednesday, he was due in court for an assault case. He will now appear in the Athlone Magistrate's court on
Monday on charges of murder. Detectives will oppose bail. In the tragic case, Sabsana, who was a successful business
owner, was shot at her home in Gugulethu in front of her parents and son, aged
10.  In an interview with her parents, detailed in an article by
City Vision on the News24 website, they said that the man shot their daughter
as she arrived home.  - Read more: Unathi shot in cold blood as her parents look on She collapsed in the passage and he then walked to his car
