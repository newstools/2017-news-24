	     Johannesburg - Voting for 80 members of the ANC national executive committee has been concluded and the EleXion agency is expected to start the marathon process of counting the votes, as the party's conference is due to draw to a close on Wednesday. However, a heated debate over disputed votes is expected to come to plenary after lengthy meetings by the conference steering committee.  Member of the steering committee Jeff Radebe confirmed that the meeting continued into Tuesday night.  "We had a meeting last night, we received a report from electoral commission. The commission - which is responsible - will be able to give a report to the plenary this morning at nine," Radebe said. The NEC is the highest decision making body of the ANC between conferences - and both the new ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa and defeated presidential candidate Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma are hoping to dominate the all powerful body. Meanwhile, ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa told News24 that the conference will not go on beyond December 20.  News24 understands that supporters of former KwaZulu-Natal ANC chairperson Senzo Mchunu, who lost out on the position of secretary general to Free State chair Ace Magashule by 24 votes, are considering legal action if the ANC does not include the disputed votes.
