	     Juba - The leaders of South Sudan's Roman Catholic Church are calling on the pope to visit this war-torn nation. "We know his heart is in South Sudan," Samuel Abe, secretary general for the archdiocese of Juba told the Associated Press on Monday. "My wish is if he comes he can be a voice for the voiceless." Pope Francis had planned to visit to this country in October, but cancelled citing security concerns caused by the country's civil war. He has donated $30 000 to help feed the country's most vulnerable citizens ahead of the upcoming dry season. The money was given to the United Nations' agricultural arm, to alleviate a period of "grave food insecurity and major displacement," said the Vatican in a statement obtained by The Associated Press.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
