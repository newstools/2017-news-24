"He has not been arrested yet. The matter is still under investigation," police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane told News24.

"When the suspects saw the police, they abandoned their vehicle and fled into the sugarcane fields, while shooting at police," Zwane said.  He said officers returned fire, killing one of the robbers at the scene while two others died on their way to hospital.  He said two pistols, a revolver and two AK47 rifles, as well as the money which was stolen were recovered.  KwaZulu-Natal acting provincial police commissioner Major General Bheki Langa applauded the police officers for their swift reaction.  "I am glad that our police officers escaped the shooting unscathed and that the stolen cash, as well as firearms, were recovered. We are working round the clock to remove illegal firearms from the hands of the criminals in our province this festive season."  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
