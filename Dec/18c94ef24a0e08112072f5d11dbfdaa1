	     President Jacob Zuma was in Maboloka on Thursday as part of the ANC election campaign in the Bojanala region of the North-West Province. In this interview he sizes up the local support, while also weighing in on the elusive Cape Town metro. Watch. WATCH Johannesburg - Disgruntled ANC members in the North West have won their court challenge to have the Bojanala regional conference nullified.  A member of the disgruntled group confirmed this to News24. The group went to court asking for an order to set aside the 40 branch general meeting and to nullify the regional conference held on September 24.  The decision comes on the eve of the ANC’s national elective conference, and it was not immediately clear if delegates from the affected branches would be allowed to attend. Dakota Lekgoete, secretary of North West, said: "We have instructed the legal team to appeal. Once we appeal, the status quo remains in terms of the [regional executive committee] and the affected 40 branches and what it means, is that all of us will be enroute to Nasrec.'' He said that the process of the regional conference to elect regional leaders, was separate from the branch general meetings, to nominate leaders to be elected at the national conference.
