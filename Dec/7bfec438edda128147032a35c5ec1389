	     Cape Town – The French Development Agency is discussing the possibility of providing financial support for the City of Cape Town's climate resilience strategy as the municipality battles a devastating drought gripping the Western Cape. "This would be mostly around infrastructure needed for desalination and water treatment and reuse," French ambassador Christophe Farnaud confirmed to News24 on Thursday. He was unable to provide further details as discussions were still underway. Mayor Patricia De Lille this week said "day zero" had moved forward by two days – from May 20 to May 18 – after water consumption increased to "dangerous levels" from an average of 611 million litres per day last week to 628 million litres this week. The city on Tuesday confirmed site preparation for the Monwabisi desalination plant was underway. Seven projects are earmarked as part of the first phase of the additional water supply programme: the Monwabisi, Strandfontein, V&A Waterfront, and Cape Town Harbour desalination plants; the Atlantis and Cape Flats aquifer projects; and the Zandvliet water recycling project. These will collectively produce an additional 196 million litres per day between February and July next year.  An additional 12 projects are also at an advanced planning stage. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
