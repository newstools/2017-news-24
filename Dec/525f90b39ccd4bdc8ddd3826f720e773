	       Dakar - UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says the attack on peacekeepers in Democratic Republic of Congo is the worst in the UN's recent history and is "a war crime." "Today is a very tragic day for the UN family," the UN chief says. Guterres is expressing "my outrage and utter heartbreak" at Thursday night's attack, saying early indications are that at least 12 Tanzanian peacekeepers were killed and at least 40 injured, four critically. He says at least five Congolese soldiers were also killed. "I condemn this attack unequivocally," he says. "These deliberate attacks on peacekeepers are unacceptable and constitute a war crime." He urges Congolese authorities to swiftly investigate and bring the perpetrators to justice.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
