	     Durban - One person was killed and two others sustained minor injuries after two vehicles collided on the N3 northbound just before the Umlaas on-ramp in KwaZulu-Natal on Friday afternoon. ER24 spokesperson, Russel Meiring, said paramedics had arrived at the scene at around 17:30, and found the driver of the one vehicle trapped inside the vehicle. "Unfortunately, there was nothing paramedics could do for the man and he was declared dead by another service on the scene." Meiring said ER24 had been assisted by the fire department to extricate the man from the vehicle with the jaws of life. "Two patients from the other vehicle were found to have sustained minor injuries. They were transported to hospital by another medical service on the scene," he said. Meiring said the exact circumstances of the incident were not yet known but police were on the scene for further investigations. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
