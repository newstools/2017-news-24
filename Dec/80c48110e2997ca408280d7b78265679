	     Cairo - An Egyptian female pop singer has been convicted of promoting debauchery in a racy video clip and sentenced to two years in prison. The Cairo court also ordered Shaimaa Ahmed, better known by her stage name Shima, to pay a fine of about $560. Shima appears in the video in her underwear singing while suggestively eating an apple and a banana before a classroom of young men. The video created a stir on social media in conservative and Muslim-majority Egypt and was discussed on TV talk shows. Tuesday's verdict by the court of misdemeanors can be appealed. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
