	     Bunia - Four people drowned while fleeing an attack by a militia group on a mining area in the violence-ridden northeast of DRC, local sources said on Wednesday. The victims died in the Ituri river attempting to escape the Mai-Mai Simba militia group in the mineral-rich Ituri province on Saturday, according to human rights group Convention for the Development of Forest Peoples and local official Idris Koma Kokodila. Forty-six people were also believed to have been abducted by the militia and used to carry loads from the site, a remote area 180km north of Bunia, a city near the troubled border with Uganda. DR Congo's huge eastern region has long been wracked by violence, with dozens of armed groups - some self-described "self-defence" militias like the Mai-Mai Simba - active in the area. Many of these groups were armed during the DR Congo's second civil war - a conflict that ran from 1998-2003 - to fight incursion by Rwandan or Ugandan combatants, and have never been disarmed. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
