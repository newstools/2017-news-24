	     Mbombela - Mpumalanga MEC for community safety, security and liaison, Pat Ngomane, has called on the police to consider charging the owner of the three cows that led to the crash that killed 10 people last night, with culpable homicide. The crash occurred when a minibus crashed into three cows on the R538 Road between Hazyview and White River. READ: 10 dead after taxi crashes into cows, catches fire Ngomane said although the police were still investigating, the owner of the cows involved should also be made to face the consequences of not looking well after their livestock. "Livestock owners have a responsibility over their stock and should therefore not leave their cattle to wander without being attended or kept in secure places." Ngomane called on the communities in the area who may know the owner of the cows, to report to the police, and called on motorists to use the road with heightened caution, especially at night and during bad weather conditions when visibility is reduced. The MEC wished a speedy recovery for five people who survived the accident and pleaded with families of the deceased to remain patient, as government was still working on identifying the victims through DNA tests.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
