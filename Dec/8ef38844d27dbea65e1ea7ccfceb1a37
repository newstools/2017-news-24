	     Johannesburg – A City of Johannesburg's disaster management official was attacked by a mob on Friday evening while responding to a structural collapse call in Alexandra, the city said on Monday. The official was attacked by a mob that fired shots at his car for "no apparent reason", MMC for public safety Michael Sun said in a statement. "A bullet struck the right side of his car, missing the official by inches, but he managed to escape unharmed," Sun said. He said similar incidents of violence against public safety officers were becoming increasingly prevalent and the city would not tolerate it. The attack by "selfish and cowardly criminals" was not only an attack on the official but an attack on the community as well, he said. Sun said the city's disaster management unit had been inundated with calls from residents whose homes had burnt down or had been flooded after flash floods on Friday. He urged anyone with information about the attack to come forward and help identify the suspects.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
