Jackson died from natural causes in the Mediclinic Bloemfontein on Saturday (09/12). This long-time community leader in Heidedal, Bloemfontein, fulfilled different roles within the community. As a respected and dedicated teacher, Jackson was involved in the profession from 1960. He had a stint at the Joe Solomon Primary School before he went on retirement in 1982. Poor health forced him to retire from the teaching profession. Jackson’s involvement in the development of the community includes serving in the Heidedal Management Committee (HMC) and ultimately actively in politics as a member of the National Party in Heidedal, Bloemfontein. In 1988 he was elected chairperson of the HMC, serving in the community structure until 1993. He was later elected to serve in the Bloemfontein City Council following the dawn of democracy in 1994. He served in the council, representing the NP, which disbanded in 2005. Clive Solomon, one of the long-time community leaders and sporting figures in Heidedal, said he would remember the late Jackson for the role he had played in community development in Heidedal and the dedicated teacher that he had been. “He played a huge role in community development as the leader of the Heidedal Management Committee, which looked after interests of the community. “Jackson was a dedicated teacher and played an immense role in the teaching profession during his time,” said Solomon. Jackon’s funeral is set to be held on Saturday, (16/12), with the service taking place in the Old Apostolic Church. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
