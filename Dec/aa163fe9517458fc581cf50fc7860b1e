	     Gauteng – A 43-year-old woman was arrested for allegedly defrauding a medical equipment company out of more than R460m, the Hawks said on Thursday. The woman was arrested on Wednesday at the Hawks’ Commercial Crime Unit office in Germiston, east of Johannesburg, following a three-month investigation, spokesperson Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu said in a statement. Mulamu said the woman was an accountant for the company and had allegedly duplicated payments by transferring money into her late husband’s bank account. The investigation team arrived at her house with search and seizure warrants on Wednesday. "The members managed to attach eleven luxurious vehicles, motorbikes, seven immovable properties... appliances and jewellery."  The woman will appear in the Johannesburg Specialised Commercial Crime Court on Friday. She is facing charges of fraud, theft and money laundering. The Gauteng head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, Major General Prince Mokotedi, said the woman's arrest should serve as a warning that "crime does not pay". "Companies... should take stock of their internal processes to curtail this kind of criminal activities. I am proud of my team, especially of the quick turnaround time, because this kind of cases tend to take long to solve," Mokotedi said.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
