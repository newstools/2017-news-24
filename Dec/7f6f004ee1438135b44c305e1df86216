The dogs were taken from Christina Fay in June. Authorities said the animals were living in filth and suffering from health problems. Fay pleaded not guilty. Fay initially was charged with 12 misdemeanor counts; Judge Charles Greenhalgh dismissed two last month. In his ruling on Tuesday, he found the evidence showed Fay didn't provide proper care or shelter for the dogs. Fay testified at her recent trial before Greenhalgh that she took good care of the animals. Authorities alleged that Fay deprived the dogs of medical treatment and fed them maggot-infested food. Her lawyers didn't immediately return a call seeking comment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
