	     “SHE’S a lovely kid and we are truly blessed to have her in our lives; she loves the camera and we would like to register her at a modelling agency.” So believes Andiswa Duruwe, mother of this year’s Front Page Christmas Baby winner, Amyoli Praise Duruwe from KwaDwesi. She was born on February 5 this year. Andiswa said her former high school teacher told her to enter the Christmas Baby competition. “I actually did not know about the competition. My high school teacher, Miss Mevana, told me about it. She said I must enter Amyoli,” she explained, and added that they never expected Amyoli to win. “She is a very bubbly kid. She is always smiling, always busy and she likes to play.” Her favourite toy is her teddy bear and her mother’s phone, so that is why she will be getting her own toy cellphone this Christmas and a pair of sunglasses, Andiswa said. For Amyoli’s first Christmas, the family, including Amyoli’s two sisters Nikki (7) and Ahluma (4), will be spending time with Andiswa’s grandmother at her house in Port Alfred. According to Andiswa, her uncle, Luyanda Duruwe, gave Amyoli her names. “The name Amyoli means ‘something brings pleasure’.  “For example, if you listen to worship songs and it gives you that satisfaction. I saw her as someone who will be a worshipper, not only by singing, but by her lifestyle. “We gave her all these names because there is a significance in naming a child. A name is a prophecy to your life, the name carries power,” Andiswa said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
