	     Johannesburg - A class-action lawsuit filed in the United States says 92 Somalis sat bound and shackled on an airplane for nearly two days, some urinating on themselves, during a botched US deportation attempt. The lawsuit filed in US District Court in Miami says US immigration agents "kicked, struck or dragged detainees" during the journey that began on December 7.  The lawsuit says the flight to Somalia from Louisiana reached Dakar, Senegal before sitting on the runway for 23 hours and returning to the US because the relief crew was not rested enough. Lawyers are alarmed that the US is returning people to a country that has long been a war zone. The Somalia-based al-Shabaab extremist group was blamed for the massive truck bombing in the capital, Mogadishu, that killed 512 in October. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
