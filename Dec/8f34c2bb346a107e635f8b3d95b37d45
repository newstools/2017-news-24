	     Pretoria – The High Court in Pretoria has ruled that Advocate Shaun Abrahams, the national director of public prosecutions, must vacate his seat. Judge Dunstan Mlambo further ruled it would not be just for the former prosecutions boss Mxolisi Nxasana to be reinstated and that due to his pending corruption case, President Jacob Zuma was conflicted in appointing an NDPP. Mlambo has ruled that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa must appoint a new NDPP in the next 60 days. Freedom Under Law, Corruption Watch and the Council for the
Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac) had gone to court seeking
an order declaring Nxasana’s removal invalid. Nxasana accepted a golden handshake from Zuma worth R17.3m
and left the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in 2015. Before that, an inquiry into his fitness to hold office was
abruptly halted without explanation. The organisations want his removal set aside and the golden
handshake repaid. During the hearing in November, the court heard that Zuma tried
to "bully" Nxasana out of office by using an inquiry into his
fitness.  - This is a breaking story. Follow News24 for further updates.       24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
