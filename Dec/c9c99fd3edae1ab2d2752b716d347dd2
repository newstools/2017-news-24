	     Abidjan - Security experts from West Africa, France and the United States gathered in Abidjan on Tuesday for talks on beefing up anti-terrorism measures at sea in the Gulf of Guinea. The three-day seminar seeks to identify terrorism risks in the Gulf of Guinea - the vast expanse of water stretching from Liberia to Gabon - and any link with terrorists in the Sahel. The Gulf of Guinea is one of Africa's hotspots for crime, ranging from piracy, armed robbery and illegal fishing to oil theft and trafficking in stolen goods. Participants will discuss measures such as specialised counter-terrorism units, pooled intelligence and private security companies,the organisers, the Ivorian-based Institute for Interregional Maritime Security (ISMI), said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
