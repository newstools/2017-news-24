Innovative digital technology will be used to enhance Emergency Medical Service (EMS) coordination over the festive season. The technology will support the dual objectives of patient-centred care, and EMS staff safety.  At the heart of this ground-breaking solution, is a technology ‘platform’ that allows WCG Health’s employees located in six Emergency Control Centres, 52 ambulance stations, and crew in 519 vehicles to collaborate around the clock, 365 days a year.  Global IT group, Dimension Data, has been collaborating with the Department to implement this technology over the last 4 years.  This is according to Western Cape Health Minister Dr Nomafrench Mbombo, who held a press conference on Tuesday to outline the Department’s festive season readiness plans.  The Western Cape EMS is one of the busiest ambulance services in South Africa, transporting between 45,000 and 50,000 patients each month.  “It is critical to get the right medical teams to the right place, quickly. When you’re providing emergency medical care to this many patients, efficiency is crucial, while also balancing the person-centred care approach and staff safety,” said Mbombo.  The provincial Health Department recently launched a Safety Plan in aid of EMS staff, who often work under dangerous conditions in parts of the metro designated as Red Zones.  As part of the Safety Plan this festive season, a dedicated EMS resource will be placed in the City of Cape Town’s Transport Management Centre (TMC) to monitor the Red Zones and alert the ambulances when entering a crime hotspot. There has also been a greater engagement between the Health Department and anti-crime initiatives linked to CCTV footage.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
