Mahlatse Mahlase Johannesburg - ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa has asked his supporters to drop a legal challenge against the 60 odd disputed votes because it may compromise the whole conference. News24 has been leaked a video of Ramaphosa addressing a group of supporters, urging them to accept the results that saw controversial Free State Premier Ace Magashule being elected secretary general of the ANC.  Magashule beat former KwaZulu-Natal ANC chairperson Senzo Mchunu by 24 votes. His supporters have lodged a complaint with the party's steering committee, overseeing the conference. Another group of supporters from Limpopo have initiated legal proceedings against the ANC. In the video, Ramaphosa can be heard telling the group that officials met over the matter. "We felt that what we must try to do is to protect the integrity of this conference. We must not allow the conference to degenerate into controversy and huge legal suits that will nullify the result that we've come up with," Ramaphosa said. Ramaphosa added that he had met some officials over the dispute after a detailed report and explanation was given to them.  "Of those 68 votes, nearly everyone there is an explanation they have produced itâ€¦ they have produced quite an extensive report... other comrades feel they should take it forward to court," he said. Ramaphosa accepted that, although the outcome was not what they had wanted, they have an opportunity to reinstall the values of the ANC. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
