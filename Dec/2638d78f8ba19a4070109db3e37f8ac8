Johannesburg - An application by 11 disgruntled ANC Eastern Cape members to nullify the province's elective conference was dismissed by the Eastern Cape High Court in Grahamstown in Tuesday, according to reports.  Broadcaster eNCA reported that those members were unhappy with the results of the party's provincial elections, which saw Oscar Mabuyane named as the new provincial chairperson. The application was dismissed with costs, and no reasons were given.  News24 reported in October that an application to interdict the Eastern Cape elective conference, which had already concluded by then, was struck off the roll by the High Court, sitting in East London.  Eight delegates were injured when violence broke out at the conference. Delegates hurled chairs at each other, in what Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa described as a "festival of chairs". This came after members disrupted events two nights before, while others who attempted to storm the venue the next evening had to be dispersed with stun grenades.      24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
