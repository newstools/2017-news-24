Teboho Setena A Wepener man, Sello Thomas (32), has received a hefty sentence for the murder of his wife, Sarah Thomas, in November last year. The accused was ­sentenced in the Wepener Regional Court on 9 November to 15 years’ im­prisonment after being found guilty of the brutal murder of his wife on 11 November last year.  He remained in custody for the duration of the one-year trial. The sentencing has brought justice to the victim, Sarah, with whom the accused has a three-year-old child.  The court found Thomas guilty on the charge of murdering his wife.  The accused had beaten her to death.  Community members had reportedly seen him dragging along and hitting his wife in broad daylight in the street of the residential settlement of Nyarela in Wepener. Thomas was arrested after eyewitnesses alerted the police about the brutal actions.  Sgt Yanga Ngcukana, police spokesperson, said the motive for the incident was unknown.  Apparently Thomas would not elaborate on the reason for his actions.  The deceased was reportedly found by the police in a pool of blood outside a house and certified dead.  Ngcukana said the woman had been naked and had sustained visible bruises all over her body.  While Thomas was convicted of murdering his wife, he was acquitted on charges relating to the murder of Tsietsi Mothebe in 2014.  The accused had been arrested after he had allegedly fatally stabbed Mothebe at a local tavern after a heated argument.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
