	     Beaufort West - One person died after a vehicle containing apparently stolen copper cables crashed in the Karoo, Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa said on Sunday. The man died on the way to hospital after the crash in the early hours of the morning.  Three other men were seen fleeing from the scene, said Africa. "There were 17 bundles of copper inside the vehicle." The accident occurred on the N1 between Beaufort West and Leeu Gamka shortly after 05:00, when the driver apparently lost control of the vehicle. "The car rolled and left the road - the vehicle landed on the side of the road." Africa said police were now using the registration number to track down the alleged thieves.       24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
