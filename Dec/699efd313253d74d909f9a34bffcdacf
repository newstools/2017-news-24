	     Monrovia - Liberia's Supreme Court on Thursday lifted a suspension on a runoff vote for a new president, saying two parties alleging irregularities and fraud had insufficient evidence to re-run the first round of voting. "This court cannot proceed to annul the entire elections," a Supreme Court justice said, adding the five-judge panel was "not convinced that burden of proof was met" and instructing the electoral commission to prepare the planned second round. However, the judge ordered a clean-up of the much criticised voter registration roll be conducted before the runoff delayed since November 7 between former international footballer George Weah and current Vice-President Joseph Boakai be held. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
