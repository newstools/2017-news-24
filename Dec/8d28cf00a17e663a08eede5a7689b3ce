	     Johannesburg – A man was left seriously injured after he was shot during a house robbery in Florida, west of Johannesburg, on Sunday evening. In a video circulating on social media, a woman and child can be seen running into the living room and trying to hide. A man with a firearm is then seen following them. In the video, it appears that he fires shots at the woman and child, before trying to take the TV off the wall. While he is doing that, another man comes into the room, and the robber fires shots at him, appearing to hit him in the upper body. A second robber then enters the room and proceeds to take the television off the wall. The two robbers managed to escape with the television. ER24 paramedics found the man in a serious condition after he was shot in the hand and his head, while the woman sustained an injury to her leg. "ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene at 21:30 and found the local CPF already in attendance. A first aider was found on the scene, already treating a man," said ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring. "Paramedics treated the patients and provided the man with pain relief medication, before they were transported to nearby hospitals for further treatment," he said.  Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele said they were investigating a case of house robbery and attempted murder. "The family were in the house when they heard someone fiddle with the gate. The man went outside to inspect and then he was overpowered," Makhubele said. "During the struggle, he was shot on the upper body," he said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
