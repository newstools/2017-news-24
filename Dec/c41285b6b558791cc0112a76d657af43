	     Durban - The KwaZulu-Natal department of home affairs says its online system is "up and running" after it experienced some technical glitches over the past week.  "The system has been back online since yesterday [Tuesday]. Anyone who wants to use the service can now do that happily," home affairs spokesperson Mava Scott told News24 on Wednesday evening. The department had difficulty with the live capture system for passports and smart ID cards. The system was offline since last week, and led some people to take out their frustrations on staff members. On Monday, police were called to the offices in Umgeni Road, in Durban, after staff members apparently received death threats.  The problems were due to the Home Affairs National Identification System (HANIS), which affected turnaround times in some offices. However, Scott has reaffirmed that the system has been restored. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
