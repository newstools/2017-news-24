	     Cape Town - A man who robbed killed a policeman at a bus stop while he waited for his transport to get to work earlier this year has been sentenced to life imprisonment. Constable Sphesihle Chiliza was murdered in Folweni on February 28, police spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said. At 04:00, Chiliza - stationed at King Shaka International Airport - had been standing at a local bus stop, dressed in his full uniform and carrying his service pistol when he was attacked by two men. "He was attacked and fatally shot by the accused. They then robbed him of his service pistol and two fully loaded magazines," Mhlongo said. The duo was arrested three weeks after the officer's murder after his gun was recovered. Mzwandile Ngidi, 23, and Mfanafuthi Ngidi, 29, were sentenced on Friday in the Durban High Court. Mzwandile was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder, fifteen years for armed robbery, fifteen years for illegal possession of a firearm and five years for possession of ammunition.  His sentence will run concurrently. Mfanafuthi was sentenced to fifteen years for armed robbery.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
