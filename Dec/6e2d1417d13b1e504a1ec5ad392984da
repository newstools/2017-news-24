MANY medical interns have completed their two years in our government hospitals and now need to do a year of community service in 2018. Sadly, many have not been placed. There are apparently no posts for them, or is there no money to pay them? However, a large number of doctors are brought in from Cuba. Why are they getting posts when our South African doctors will be without work? They will not be able to practise on their own without having done the community service year. Will we have a large number of doctors becoming waiters next year? This after they have had the toughest two years serving in understaffed government hospitals. Surely our hospitals and clinics need them. W. BORNHEIMER 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
