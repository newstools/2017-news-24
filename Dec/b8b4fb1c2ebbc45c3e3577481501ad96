	     Atop private healthcare executive has been suspended after allegedly assaulting a close female relative and two friends in the early hours of last Sunday morning. “He asked that we women go into another room and he started beating the guy up. Then [his relative] tried to intervene. Then he started beating [her] and threw her against the sliding door. He kicked her and she fell to the ground, then he dragged her to the next room. He sat on top of her, choked her and I’m there trying to pull him off her. Eventually he gets up and goes back to the other guy to attack him,” Gaomphe said. "Demon-possessed" The assault continued until the man’s relative ran to the car to fetch pepper spray and sprayed it around the room. The couple then left.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
