                 Scathing judgment finds Madonsela's actions against Zuma 'wise, necessary, rational, appropriate' Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's recommended remedial actions 
after her investigation into state capture were wise, necessary, 
rational and appropriate, the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria found
 on Wednesday. Maimane advises Zuma to ask the Guptas for a loan to pay legal costs President Jacob Zuma might have to fork out as much as R1.5m in legal fees for delaying the release of the state capture report. Statement from the new party headed by former ANC MP Makhosi
Khoza

 The African Democratic Change is of the
firm belief that President Jacob Zuma should face the full might of the law.  We
note the President missed his deadline to make representations on why he should
not be prosecuted for corruption.  However, we believe that South Africa and its
citizens deserve to see the judicial system work in their interest.

 Cope says the judgment is not extraordinary

 

 "This man has been acting as law unto himself.

 

 The blame for this situation must before the entire
leadership of the ANC"
