	     Cairo - An Egyptian lawyer says a military court has sentenced an army colonel to six years in prison after he announced his intention to run against President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi in next year's elections. The lawyer, Asaad Heikal, told The Associated Press that Colonel Ahmed Konsowa was present at Tuesday's sentencing hearing by a Cairo military court. He was convicted of violating military regulations banning political activism by active duty officers. The verdict can be appealed. Konsowa, 42, was detained following his December 2 announcement that he would run against Sisi, a general-turned-president who took office in 2014. Egypt's presidential elections are due early next year. Sisi is virtually certain to run, although he has yet to make a formal announcement. A prominent rights activist, Khaled Ali, has said he would run. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
