	     Johannesburg - Outgoing ANC president Jacob Zuma gave his final speech for the party as he opened it's national elective conference in Nasrec, Johannesburg on Saturday.  In a lengthy speech, Zuma slammed multiple groups and members he felt were actively working against the ANC, but said he did not bear grudges.  "You are my comrades. I have no ill feelings", he said.  Zuma also proposed that the ANC's national elective conference decide on suitable sanctions for members who take the party to court. While some users on Twitter said they were moved by the president's speech, others didn't hold back in their criticisms.
