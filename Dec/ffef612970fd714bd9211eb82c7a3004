	     Jerusalem - Egypt has warned of "possible dangerous repercussions" if US President Donald Trump follows through on plans to recognize contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Egypt's Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry had discussed the matter with his French counterpart. It said they called on the Trump administration to wait and reconsider. French President Emmanuel Macron earlier said he reminded Trump in a phone call that the fate of Jerusalem should be determined in negotiations on setting up a Palestinian state alongside Israel. Macron said he expressed concern about any possible unilateral US moves and that he agreed with Trump "to speak again shortly on this subject." US officials have said Trump may recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a highly charged declaration that risks inflaming tensions across the Middle East but would be a way to offset a likely decision delaying his campaign promise to move the US Embassy there from Tel Aviv.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
