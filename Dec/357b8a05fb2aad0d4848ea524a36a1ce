	     Johannesburg – The Hawks have confirmed that they are still investigating the leak of classified information that ended up being published in Jacques Pauw's book, The President's Keepers. Last month Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi told News24 that a case had been opened by the State Security Agency and the Hawks were tasked with investigating the source of the leak. READ: Hawks investigate leak of classified information used in Jacques Pauw book Mulaudzi confirmed to News24 on Saturday that investigations were still continuing, but said no further details would be shared. The investigation comes in the wake of two cease and desist letters that have been sent to Pauw and NB Publishers. The SSA is claiming that the content of the book violated the Intelligence Services Act and threatened to approach the court for an interdict to prevent further distribution, publishing or promotion if the book was not withdrawn from store shelves. The publishers released a statement shortly after the letters saying that they would stand behind the book. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
