	     Cape Town – The first order of business for newly-elected ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa should be to institute the much-awaited state capture inquiry, the South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) said on Monday evening.  The institution of the inquiry, recommended by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela in her 355-page State of Capture report in 2016, has been delayed by President Jacob Zuma. Zuma took the report on review to the North Gauteng High Court and raised concerns about the recommendation that the Chief Justice appoint a judge to head the inquiry, saying that it infringed his presidential powers.

Mahlangu said Ramaphosa must chart “a new era of hope” for the country and "ignite a new spirit of patriotism". "The challenge facing the new leadership will be how to forge unity and weed out the culture of factionalism and personality cult that had entrenched itself and characterised the outgone NEC," he said. "[Ramaphosa] must prioritise rebuilding the ANC’s image… and [reclaim] the founding values of the 105-year-old liberation movement." Mahlangu said he also hoped the current elections would mark the end of slate politics in the ANC. "History will judge harshly those who wish to perpetuate divisions within the ranks of the movement." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
