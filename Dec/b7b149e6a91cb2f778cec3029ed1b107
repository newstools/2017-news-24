IN an armed robbery in Dalton last Monday three of a four-member gang were killed in a shoot-out with the SAPS. A service station owner was about to enter the bank when he was accosted by three armed men. They grabbed the bag of cash at gun point and then drove off towards Seven Oaks in a silver Mercedes. It was reported they were seen by the police, abandoned the vehicle and tried to escape into surrounding sugar-cane fields. The robbers fired at the police who returned fire. One suspect died at the scene, two en route to hospital and the fourth managed to escape. Police recovered two AK47s, two pistols, a revolver and the bag of cash. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the Mercedes had been hijacked in Prestbury in October last year. The police operation involved the KZN Crime Intelligence, the special task force, Durban Hawks and the Pietermaritzburg Flying Squad. The businessman, who requested not to be identified, said he deposited money at random times during the week, but suspected the gang had been watching him over a period of time. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
