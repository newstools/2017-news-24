	     Cape Town - Zimbabweans have taken to social media to mock and express disappointment at President Emmerson Mnangagwa's newly appointed cabinet filled with ruling party loyalists and figures linked to the military, whose takeover helped oust former leader Robert Mugabe. No opposition politicians were included in Mnangagwa's first cabinet. Some on social media were quick to point out that the new cabinet lacked gender parity, adding that ex-president Mugabe fared better than the new leader in this regard. Others were disappointed over Mnangagwa's lack of inclusion of young people, as his cabinet was made up of Zanu-PF stalwarts who were reportedly above 60 years.  See the tweets below Mnangagwa appointed as foreign affairs minister Sibusiso Moyo, the army major general who went on state television announcing the military's take-over, a dramatic power grab which culminated in Mugabe stepping down a week later. The long-serving airforce commander Perence Shiri also became the Lands and Agriculture minister, according to a statement released late Thursday night. Mnangagwa, however, kept a sizeable number of ministers from Mugabe's former cabinet - including Patrick Chinamasa who returns to the finance ministry from which he had been removed by Mugabe during a cabinet reshuffle in October. War veteran leaders, who spearheaded mass protests to force Mugabe out of office, four days after the military sent tanks to the streets of the capital Harare, were also awarded positions in the cabinet. Chris Mutsvangwa was now the information minister while another became a deputy in the defence and security ministry. So we have a new cabinet in office in Zimbabwe and here is how it looks like pic.twitter.com/RCDYAWBpyx This is what happened in #Zimbabwe today.

It is ridiculously male dominated with 3/22 being women . Our Constitution implores gender balance at all levels of government. Mr. Mugabe's cabinets achieved better in this regard#CabinetZW #Zimbabwe pic.twitter.com/0NOeUer9J0 Barber: What will it be cuz?

Biggest losers are the PEOPLE of Zimbabwe. How are we supposed to have faith in a bunch of recycled garbage that's responsible for running down our economy in the first place? I am reminded of the feeling one has climbing dwalas in the #Matopos. You think you have got to the summit, but it is false, and there is another climb ahead. Keep climbing #Zimbabwe - we are getting close to the summit and the view is wonderful from up there. #Zimbabwe new minister of foreign affairs.But shush, it’s not a coup.???????????????????????????????????? pic.twitter.com/iQHhylRXuH If Florence Ziyambi is still the Deputy Prosecutor General of Zimbabwe then her husband , Cde Ziyambi Ziyambi will be her boss since he's the Minister of Justice .Oh and the average age of new cabinet seems to be roughly 68. Same old issues we struggled with.#CabinetZW President Mnangagwa’s Cabinet is very disappointing. Largely the same people that caused this crisis have been recycled. The honey moon comes to an end and reality dawns. His concern seems to have been rewarding those who brought him to power and Zanu-PF unity. #Zimbabwe ???? pic.twitter.com/pGDz5t9EAH — Trevor Ncube (@TrevorNcube) December 1, 2017  President ED Mnangagwa betrayed the masses who poured out into the streets in his support by his ‘new’ cabinet.
