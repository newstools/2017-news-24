Speaking to News24 from Upington, Captain Jack September confirmed the death of the 52-year-old painter.

"From the arid and unforgiving terrain of the Namib Desert, the Karoo and the Kalahari through the small towns and dilapidated farmhouses dotted across the South African terrain to the rich vegetation around Camps Bay and the sparkling blue waters of the Atlantic Ocean," the gallery said of the scenes depicted in his work.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
