	     Harare - First class air travel on four foreign trips per year;
private houses and a veritable army of aides and domestic staff – these are
some of the benefits Robert Mugabe will enjoy after he was forced to resign last
month. No tightening of the belt for the 93-year-old jetsetter
whose unpopular wife was known as Gucci Grace: Mugabe gets a diplomatic
passport and three vehicles, including a Mercedes limousine. There’ll also be a four-wheel drive station wagon and a
pick-up. What if they wear out? No worries Your Ex-Excellency – they’ll be
replaced every five years. The benefits are laid out in an official government notice
just published by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, reports the state-run Herald.  And Grace certainly won’t be watering her vegetable garden
herself. The notice says: “There shall be employed in connection with
the residence of the former President (i) three domestic employees, and (ii)
two gardeners, and (iii) two cooks and two waiters and (iv) two laundry
persons.” “The ex-president will also get security staff, office
workers and aide de camp officers,” said the Herald.  The regulations state that
any president who has served at least one full term since 1987 shall be
eligible for the benefits. Mugabe, a former prime minister, became executive
president in 1987. Zimbabweans on social media were on Thursday incredulous. “When I grow up I want to be a retired President!” tweeted
@denvern3. Media watchdog, ZimMediaReview commented: “One day we’ll
have many former presidents :) It will be costly.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
