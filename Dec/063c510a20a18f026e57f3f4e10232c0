	     Cape Town - President Jacob Zuma expressed deep sadness and extended his condolences to the family on the passing of liberation struggle veteran and former Robben Island prisoner, Edward "Eddie" Daniels. "We have learned with deep sadness [of] the passing of the dedicated and fearless liberation struggle veteran and political prisoner, Comrade Edward Daniels, who contributed immensely in the struggle for freedom and development of the democratic South Africa. "We wish to convey our sincere heartfelt condolences to Daniels' family and relatives, our prayer[s] and thoughts are with them in this difficult period. May his soul rest in peace," Zuma said.   Daniels passed away on Thursday, November 30 in Cape Town at the age of 89. Daniels was born in District Six in Cape Town in 1928. He joined the Liberal Party in 1959 and later joined the National Committee for Liberation, which became the African Resistance Movement (ARM) in 1961.  Although he was not a member of the African National Congress, he was close to former president Nelson Mandela.  He was arrested in July 1964 and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, the majority of which he spent on Robben Island, where he furthered his education, obtaining BA and BComm degrees. After his release he obtained a teacher's diploma and became a teacher. In 1994, Daniels completed his memoir, published under the title "There and Back: Robben Island 1964-1979".   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
