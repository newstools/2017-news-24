	     Harare – Zimbabwe's new
president Emmerson Mnangagwa has reportedly described his first 10 days in
office as "hectic", but remained optimistic that his new team of ministers will
turn around the economy of the country.  According to the
state-owned Herald newspaper, Mnangagwa said this during a brief interview
following the swearing in of 21 Cabinet ministers at the state house in Harare
on Monday. "It has been hectic, but I
believe that with my team we will stand up to the challenge," Mnangagwa
was quoted as saying. AFP reported on Monday that Mnangagwa called for
public unity to revive the country's sickly economy as his new cabinet took
office. "I have sworn in a new cabinet
just to finish the term of the former president, which is a period of six to
seven months," Mnangagwa said after the new ministers took the oath of
office. "I believe with my team we
will stand up to the challenge." "I want them (Zimbabweans) to
be united, we must grow our economy," he added. Mnangagwa
was seen as favourite to succeed long-time ruler Robert Mugabe but then fell out with his boss. Mugabe dismissed him after the then
first lady, Grace Mugabe, accused him of plotting to topple her husband. He briefly
went into exile, returning after the army stepped in and the ruling party
expelled Mugabe and a coterie of allies. The veteran ruler resigned on November
21 after 37 years in power.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
