	     Butterworth - Police have arrested a man for the alleged rape of a woman who was returning home from a traditional ceremony on Friday. Police spokesperson, Captain Jackson Manatha, said the woman had been walking home after the ceremony at around 3.20am on Friday morning when she was approached by a man in the Mqambeli Locality, Bawa Village, Butterworth. He said the woman had asked the man to accompany her to her home, and the man had agreed, but as they got closer to her home the man had become aggressive, saying that he could not just accompany her. “He demanded to have sex with the victim. When the victim refused, she was severely assaulted and dragged to a nearby forest where she was allegedly raped,” said Manatha. Manatha said the man had then forced the woman to his home, where they slept until morning, before he released her and allowed her to return home. Manatha said a case of rape was registered at Butterworth police station. He said police had acted swiftly and traced the man and arrested him. Manatha said police had been warning communities not to let their traditional ceremonies run as late, appealing to them to end at around 5pm to avoid crimes. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
