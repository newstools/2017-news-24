	     Cape Town - A father and son suffered burn wounds and smoke inhalation in an early morning fire in Factreton, Cape Town on Saturday. Local community police forum spokesperson Zainulabideen van der Schyff said representatives of their organisation were at the scene after the fire broke out at about 04:00 in Glider Crescent. One house was severely damaged while seven backyard structures were destroyed, he said. “Thankfully there were no fatalities. [We have] confirmed that a father and his son [had suffered] severe burns.” A City of Cape Town fire services spokesperson was not immediately available for comment. Disaster Risk Management spokesperson Charlotte Powell said humanitarian relief was being provided by the Mustadafin Foundation, with council supplying the backyarders with material to rebuild. Powell said according to their information, no injuries were reported and the fire was limited to one house and informal structure. Van der Schyff, however, had photos of a little boy heavily bandaged in a hospital bed as well as eight completely razed sheet metal structures. Those affected are temporarily staying with family and friends. Van der Schyff appealed to anyone able to donate food, bedding or perishables to the affected families to drop it off at the Kensington police station. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
