	     The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leadership took a day
off from politics as they embark on an academic trip to the University of the
Witwatersrand (Wits) to celebrate with Mbuyiseni Ndlozi who graduated with his
doctorate in political studies. Already able to boast about his good looks and authoritative
melodic singing, he can add a PhD to his accomplishments, boosting his academic
credentials. In celebration with their fighter, EFF leadership took to social
media to show their support and joy.  EFF president, Julius Malema tweeted, “Celebrating one of our own,
congratulations Dr @MbuyiseniNdlozi.
