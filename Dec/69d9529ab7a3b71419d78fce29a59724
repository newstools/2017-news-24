	     Harare – A Zimbabwean man has appeared in court after he was charged for undermining the authority of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, said a report.  Gustiv Kativhu was charged for calling Mnangagwa a "murderer" at the recently concluded Zanu-PF congress that sealed former president Robert Mugabe's fall from grace, according to New Zimbabwe.com. Kitivhu was arrested at the Robert Mugabe square where the ruling party had met to endorse Mnangagwa as party leader on Friday.  The 45-year-old was protesting outside the venue carrying anti-Mnangagwa placards. Some read: "Mnangagwa killed my friend. Zanu-PF is giving jobs to China. Mnangagwa–Chiwenga diamond mafia. Chiwenga don’t beat vendors, give them jobs." Another of the placards called for the upcoming 2018 elections to be monitored by the United Nation, fearing that it could result in another 37 years of no employment.   Kativhu maintained in court that Mnangagwa was abusive, accusing him of trying to act as if the country was still under Ian Smith's regime.  "[I] wanted to tell him that he killed my friend," he was quoted as saying.  The state said that it had three witnesses against the accused.  The man was being held in custody until December 21. Under Mugabe's rule, the government had clamped down on freedom of expression, with dozens of Zimbabweans falling foul of the law.     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
