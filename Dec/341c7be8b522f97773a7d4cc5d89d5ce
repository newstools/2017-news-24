This is what Northdale residents face because of the alleged rise in crime in the railway line area. Residents who live next to the railway line told Maritzburg Fever the place has become a crime hot spot as people are robbed almost every day. Dlamini Mfusi said criminals hide in the bush next to the line and wait for people on their way to work and those coming back. “We no longer enjoy living here. People’s cellphones and belongings are stolen from them. This is the stop where people­ get off taxis, and have to cross the railway line on their way home.It has become so dangerous. Even school children are robbed of their cellphones. Sometimes I think of leaving, but I can’t just leave my house. Where do I?” she asked. Naik Ruby, a Lotus Road resident said criminals also break into houses when they are not home. “We are scared to leave our houses now because criminals hide in the bush near the line and when they see you leave home, they break in. This place is dangerous. “The municipality must cut the grass so pedestrians can walk without having to look over their shoulder,” she said. Residents said three weeks ago an Indian lady was found dead in the bush. She was allegedly robbed, choked and stabbed to death. “There was a funny smell and people called the police and the body of a woman was found. We cannot live like this, it must come to an end,” said a resident, who refused to give her name. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
