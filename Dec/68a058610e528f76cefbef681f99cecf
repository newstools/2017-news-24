	     Johannesburg – Bemawu, one of the two unions at the South
African Broadcasting Corporation, has accepted a revised increase from the
public broadcaster, and has called off its strike.  In a short statement on Saturday, SABC spokesperson Kaizer
Kganyago said a resolution has been reached with Broadcasting, Electronic Media
and Allied Workers Union (Bemawu) regarding wage negotiations for the 2017/18
financial year, with members agreeing to receive a 4.8% increase in basic
salary, back-dated to July 2017. This follows after workers across the country embarked on
strike action on Thursday after rejecting the broadcaster's offer of a 4.5%
increase, demanding a 10% increase. "Bemawu has now officially called off their strike
action. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) is currently seeking concurrence
on the offer with their members and they will revert to us when that process is
completed," he said. SABC acting group chief executive officer, Nomsa Philiso,
said negotiations were quite tough as all parties had to find each other in
reaching a solution. "With the organisation dealing with a financial
situation which is not ideal, we have had to strike a balance between taking
care of employees, which is a priority and ensuring we do not put further
stress on the finances of the SABC," said Philiso. Kganyago said the SABC expressed its gratitude to all
managers and staff members who kept the ship afloat during the protest action. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
