	     Harare -  Zimbabwe's parks agency says it has seized 200kg of ivory destined for Malaysia. National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority spokesperson Tinashe Farawo on Wednesday said the ivory was worth over $500 000. Farawo says no one has been arrested yet and police questioned officials from a travel agency before releasing them. Poaching is rife in Zimbabwe's national parks, which teem with elephants and other big game. The agency says close to 900 elephants have been poached since 2013. The southern African country is estimated to have more than 84 000 elephants. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
