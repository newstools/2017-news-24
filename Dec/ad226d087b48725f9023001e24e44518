	     Pretoria - The High Court in Pretoria ruled on Friday that Advocate Shaun Abrahams, the national director of public prosecutions, must vacate his seat.  Judge Dunstan Mlambo further ruled it would not be just for the former prosecutions boss Mxolisi Nxasana to be reinstated and that due to his pending corruption case, President Jacob Zuma was conflicted in appointing an NDPP.  Mlambo has ruled that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa must appoint a new NDPP in the next 60 days.  The court also found that the settlement agreement reached between Nxasana and Zuma was invalid and that the R17.3m golden handshake should also be set aside and be paid back by Nxasana. The Presidency and the NPA announced soon after that they would appeal the judgement. Twitter, as always, didn't miss a beat with their reactions to the news.
