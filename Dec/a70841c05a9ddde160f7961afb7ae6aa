	     It's the last day of the ANC's national elective conference at Nasrec and there's still plenty to be done. Will the conference close as scheduled?


WATCH Johannesburg - The attorney representing ANC delegates from Limpopo, who form part of the mysterious missing 60 plus voters, has been invited to a meeting at Luthuli House with the party later this week.  "They have responded and called for a meeting. We are preparing to meet them and talk about this issue and to find a solution to this problem," attorney Dexter Selepe told News24 on Wednesday evening. Earlier on Wednesday, they gave the ANC until the end of the conference to respond. The group of supporters from Limpopo have initiated legal proceedings against the ANC. They wanted the votes included, with the hope that former KwaZulu-Natal premier and provincial chair Senzo Mchunu would overturn Free State premier Ace Magashule’s secretary general victory. Magashule beat Mchunu by 24 votes. Dexter said the party told them that the meeting would take place on Thursday or Friday.  "We are waiting for our clients to come out of plenary and we will then consult with the ANC on the times which [are] suitable." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
