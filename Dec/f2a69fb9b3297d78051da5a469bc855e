	     Durban - Medical rescue service IPSS has called off a search for a 13-year-old boy who went missing at Sheffield Beach on the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday. The beach is designated as a no-swimming beach. Authorities made use of jet skis and a drone in an effort to find the teen. The search is expected to continue on Sunday morning, after a three-hour search by authorities had to be called off due to high winds and rough sea conditions. IPSS’s Paul Herbst said in a statement that the boy had been seen swimming by a passerby, before disappearing under the waves. "The bystander entered the water to try to locate the boy, but was unsuccessful in his efforts," Herbst said.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
