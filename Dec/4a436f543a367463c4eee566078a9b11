HARDING SAPS are asking the public for help in finding the driver of a white minibus taxi with an NCW registration, which was involved in an accident on Saturday on the N2, near Ingeli Lodge.  At about 1.30pm the taxi driver allegedly knocked over a pedestrian, resulting in the pedestrian’s death.  Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Zandra Wiid said the driver then stopped 50 metres away from the alleged “hit” to let passengers off so he could allegedly “check the vehicle for damages from the accident”. Police are investigating a culpable homicide case.  The investigating officer is Detective Constable Nkosikhona Hlophe, who can be contacted on 039 433 9634 or 078 238 1464 at Harding Detective Service.  - Supplied. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
