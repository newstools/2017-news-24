	     Johannesburg – The body of a nine-month-old baby girl, who went missing after her mother’s attempted rape, was found on Tuesday evening near an abattoir in Parys, Free State police confirmed on Wednesday. Colonel Thandi Mbombo told News24 that the decomposed body of the infant was discovered in the bushes by a passerby just after 18:30 in the evening. "Due to the state that the body was found in, it was difficult to determine how the baby died and a post-mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death,” read a statement. Police in Tumahole, Parys, had been searching for baby Kutloano Maloitsane after a man snatched her from her deaf and mute mother on December 16. The 22-year-old woman was making her way back from her parent’s house, with her baby on her back, when a man approached her, grabbed her by the hand, and attempted to rape her.  "She [the mother] managed to get away, but unfortunately the baby fell down and the unknown male took the baby and ran away,” read the police statement. Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major-General Tollie Afonso, encouraged residents to come forward with any information that would lead to the arrest of the suspect. "The community needs to stand against abuse and senseless killing of our innocent children," the statement read. Mbombo told News24 that no arrests had been made yet. A murder case had been opened, and anyone with information was asked to contact Detective Captain Lois Ferreira on 083 419 7361.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
