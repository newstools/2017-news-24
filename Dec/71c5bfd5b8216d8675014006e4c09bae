	     East London - A 25-year-old man is missing after a suspected drowning at Eastern Beach in East London on Sunday morning, the National Sea Rescue Institute said. "We believe that a group of people were swimming when the missing man was caught in rip currents before disappearing under water," said NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon in a statement. The incident happened shortly after 06:00.  An extensive search involving the NSRI, police divers and municipal rescue services ensued has so far yielded no results. Lambinon said the search would continue through Sunday. Police have also opened an investigation. Meanwhile, the NSRI also issued a warning to the public about the new moon spring tide which will peak on Monday. "Incoming waves during the high tides engulf higher than normal over rocks," said Lambinon. "Beach bathers and shoreline anglers are most at risk." The public was urged to only swim at beaches where lifeguards were present and anglers were urged not to turn their back to the sea.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
