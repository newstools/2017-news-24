	     Providence - A baby who had been on life support since April, when his parents were arrested, has died and officials believe his father may have fled to Nigeria. The Providence Journal reports 11-month-old Tobi Olawusi died on Wednesday at Hasbro Children's Hospital. Officials say his father, Olalekan Olawusi, apparently skipped bail. He's charged with felony first-degree child abuse. The baby was the subject of the newspaper's investigation into procedures the state uses to allow newborns to go home when a parent's competency is questioned. His mother, Arinola Olawusi, pleaded not guilty to felony cruelty or child neglect. The newspaper reports Tobi arrived at the hospital with broken bones, a fractured skull and a human bite mark. Providence police say they'll seek extradition if Olalekan Olawusi is in Nigeria. His attorney didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
