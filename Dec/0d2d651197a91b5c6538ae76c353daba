	     Cape Town – The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services on Wednesday said it welcomed the judgment by the North Gauteng High Court on the former Public Protector's recommended remedial actions after her investigation into state capture.  "The nation will be assured that we have an independent judiciary that continues to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law in the country and that all citizens, regardless of their public or private standing, are subject to the Constitution and the rule of law," committee chairperson Mathole Motshekga said in a statement. In Wednesday's scathing landmark judgment, a full Bench of the court, led by Judge President Dunstan Mlambo, dismissed President Jacob Zuma's application against Madonsela's report, finding that he must institute a commission of inquiry into state capture within 30 days. This would be headed by a judge appointed by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, as per the "binding" remedial actions put forward by Madonsela. In the judgment, Zuma was held personally liable for the costs of his legal challenge, as well as his aborted application to halt the report from being released. The court found that Madonsela's recommended remedial actions after her investigation into state capture were wise, necessary, rational and appropriate. Following the judgment, the former Public Protector said she was happy with the court's decision and believed that she and her team had done their jobs. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
