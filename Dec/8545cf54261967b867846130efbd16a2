	     Benghazi - A Libyan legislator says the parliament based in the east has appointed a new governor for the central bank, which could heighten tensions with the UN-backed government in Tripoli. Saleh Afhaima told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the House of Representatives based in Tobruk approved Mohamed el-Shukri as the new governor of the bank, which controls the country's oil revenues. The parliament sacked Sadik el-Kabir and appointed his deputy, Ali Hibri, as the new head of the Tripoli-based bank in September 2014. El-Kabir challenged the decision and says he remains at his post. Libya descended into chaos following the 2011 uprising that toppled and killed dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The oil-rich nation is now split between rival governments and militias. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
