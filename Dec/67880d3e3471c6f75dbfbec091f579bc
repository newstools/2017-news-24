	     LARATA Dance Club members are training for the South African Ballroom Championships at Sun City on December 14, 15 and 16.  The coach, Thabo Mlovu, said they will show their agility and skill in ballroom and Latin-American. Dance clubs from around the province are also participating but Mlovu said this doesn’t worry the Kokstad dancers because they are training really hard. “We have 20 dancers from Kokstad who are going to Sun City and are ready for the competition,” said Mlovu.  He said this year the Larata dancers have brought home trophies and certificates after participating in many competitions. - Supplied  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
