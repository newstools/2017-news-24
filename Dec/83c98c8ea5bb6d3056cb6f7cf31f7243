	     INCOMPLETE repairs and construction on Old Main St Faiths road from two months ago have raised concerns among motorists with specific concerns about an “accident waiting to happen”, especially during peak season. St Faiths resident Wilson Ngcobo said he uses the road between Port Shepstone and Oshabeni frequently and often sees motorists driving on the incorrect lane in order to avoid the gravel patch on the left side of the road.  “This is an accident waiting to happen. It is now peak season and there will be a high influx of traffic on all roads. How will this one functioning lane be navigated,” he said.  Ngcobo said the pothole, which he said was left behind following municipal fixtures to the road, is an example of slow service delivery in the area.  “I feel that development and service delivery in rural areas in particular is very slow because the municipality neglects these areas.  “In this case, for instance, why would the municipality hire a contractor that would not finish or do their job properly,” said Ngcobo.  “When residents take to the streets in protest they waste more of taxpayers’ monies when these issues could have been simply resolved by properly delivering services,” said Ngcobo.    Ray Nkonyeni municipality spokesperson Simon April said the road was outside of their jurisdiction. “The road in question is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transport. The concern will be escalated to their offices.”  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
