	     Cape Town - A hiker was airlifted from Lion’s Head on Saturday afternoon after suffering a heart attack, the Wilderness Search and Rescue (WSAR) has confirmed. Spokesperson Johan Marais said the 37-year-old man was almost at the top of the mountain when he experienced chest pains. WSAR carriers were called to assist with a possible carry-out and an experienced mountaineer headed up the track with paramedics, who reported the hiker’s condition as serious, he said. A Skymed helicopter was dispatched and a landing zone was created in the Kramat area, from where he was flown from the mountain and to Vincent Palotti Hospital for treatment, Marais said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
