Sportsmen and women are empathetic to the plight of those with life-threatening blood disorders as they appreciate the fact they can enjoy outdoor sport. “Leukaemia patients often spend weeks or months in isolation wards, and sport is not an option for them,” says Allison Ekstrand of The Sunflower Fund. Miles4Hope participants are equipped with the tools to assist them in approaching their personal and work databases to sponsor them financially per mile or kilometre covered with no contribution being too small. Funds raised from the campaign will enable The Sunflower Fund to create awareness as well as educate and recruit more blood stem cell donors to offer the hope of life to patients in need of a life-saving transplant. Any person or club interested in joining the Miles4Hope 2018 campaign may contact Ekstrand on 031 266 1148 or email allison@sunflowerfund.org.za Of special note from the Sunflower Fund regional office is the current availability of limited charity bonds for the 2018 Cape Town Cycle Tour to KZN participants at R1 500 per cyclist, kit not included.
