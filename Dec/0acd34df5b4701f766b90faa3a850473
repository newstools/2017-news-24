	     Cape Town – The Western Cape High Court is expected to rule on Friday whether the two cousins accused of raping and killing 19-year-old Sinoxolo Mafevuka in Khayelitsha last year are guilty of murder.  The cousins, Xolisa and Athabile Mafilika, have pleaded not guilty.  Mafevuka was found dead in a communal toilet in SST 2 Block, Town Two, in Khayelitsha, on March 2, 2016. A post-mortem confirmed she had been strangled. Her naked body was found slumped over a toilet. Her clothes had been stuffed into the cistern. Water from the leaking toilet is believed to have washed DNA evidence away. Her murder not only shocked her neighbours, but also led to visits from politicians who highlighted the reality of daily life for people such as Mafevuka. Former deputy police minister Maggie Sotyu and EFF leader Julius Malema were among those who visited Mafevuka's grieving family. At the time of the murder, the case attracted widespread interest. Police claim the duo had been angry after Mafevuka had, days before her murder, left a Khayelitsha tavern with another man. This while their cousin was making plans to marry her. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
