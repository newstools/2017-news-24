Jan Bornman Durban – One person died and nine others were injured on Thursday morning after a truck lost control and fell on top of two cars, and then crashed into three others on the M7 in Durban. Rescue Care’s operations director, Garrith Jamieson, said it appeared the truck’s load had shifted after it went around a corner, and that the driver then lost control of the vehicle.  He said the truck crashed into three cars before overturning and crushing two other cars. "In one vehicle paramedics found three occupants severely entrapped. The driver was assessed and found to have sustained major injuries, unfortunately there was nothing more paramedics could do and he was declared deceased at the scene.  Two passengers were later freed from the vehicle and rushed to hospital. The cause of the crash was being investigated.  *This story has been updated to include the latest information from paramedics.
