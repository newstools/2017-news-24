	     Cape Town – The biological mother and stepfather of three-year-old Poppie van der Merwe were convicted of her murder in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria on Wednesday. Judge Bert Bam found Poppie’s mother Louisa Koekemoer, and stepfather Kobus Koekemoer, guilty of one charge of murder and two of child abuse, Netwerk24 reported. The child abuse convictions related to Poppie's brother and stepsister.

The couple was arrested after Poppie died near Mamogaleskraal outside Brits, in October last year, News24 previously reported. Bam said that, although much of the evidence was circumstantial, it should be viewed as a "mosaic". He added that both accused had a duty to protect the children, but they ended up blaming each other for the abuse of the children, indicating that they were both aware of what was happening. The case has been postponed to February for sentencing proceedings. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
