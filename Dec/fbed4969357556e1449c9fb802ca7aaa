	     AFTER fighting cancer for four years Misizizwe­ “Miso” Khoza from Pelham still remains positive. The soon-to-be Maritzburg College Grade 12 pupil was in 2013 diagnosed with third stage Ewing sarcoma cancer. Miso has not been able to attend school much this year because of being in and out of hospital.  However, he managed to write his Grade 11 final exams and passed, and according to his mother Nqobile, he is looking forward to Grade 12. Nqobile said she is proud of Miso, but said, unfortunately, his health has worsened.  Speaking to Maritzburg Fever she said Miso was admitted to hospital last Friday and is unable to walk due to being paralysed.  “Miso was doing fine, but things started to change two weeks ago. He complained about severe pain and was in and out of hospital being treated for the pain.  “Last Thursday he had a CT scan and doctors found the cancer has spread to his whole body, brain, lungs, spinal cord, everywhere, and I had to take him to hospital.”  She said since being admitted Miso has received overwhelming support from his support group and the community­ of Pietermaritzburg. “I am very grateful for the support we are getting and hope people continue­ to support us on this difficult journey. “Miso is so positive and is looking forward to next year as he has plans of finishing matric and going to university. I hope people continue praying for him so he gets better, returns to school and fulfils his dreams,” she said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
