	     Polokwane - A Limpopo man was hospitalised after being raped at gunpoint by two middle-aged women, police said on Sunday. "The victim is presently admitted in hospital [in] a serious condition for medical treatment," said spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe. He said the 25-year-old man was hitchhiking in Polokwane on Saturday morning when the two women in a Toyota Tazz stopped to pick him up. However they turned into bushes in Magoebaskloof, pointed guns at him and made him drink "a certain substance". Then they took turns to rape him. Afterwards they left him in a secluded area near the Tzaneen CBD. He reported the attack to the police and was taken to hospital, said Ngoepe. Anyone with information about this attack is asked to contact Lieutenant-Colonel Cecil Machimani on 082 451 7181 or Crime Stop on 0860010111 or Crime Line SMS 32211, or their nearest police station. Ngoepe urged people to use reliable public transport and warned people of crimes that often start at a hitchhiking spot. Laboratory tests will determine the nature of the substance he was forced to drink, said Ngoepe. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
