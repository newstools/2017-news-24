	     Durban – Despite a commanding victory for Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma in the KwaZulu-Natal provincial general council (PGC), many were surprised at the high number of nominations for her rival, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa. While Dlamini-Zuma took 433 branches, Ramaphosa took 193 - something delegates was not expecting. Speaking to News24 earlier in the day, several delegates said expectations were that the deputy president would get no more than 100 nominations. “You have to understand, this is KZN and we are ANC for Nkosazana all the way. She will dominate. You will see,” a staunch Dlamini-Zuma supporter said. However, many were shocked when they realised that Ramaphosa had more support than they had anticipated. Meanwhile, Zweli Mkize took a paltry six nominations and there were 56 abstentions. Vocal KZN youth league secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo was quick to call for the verification of certain branches, after the results were announced. But provincial chairperson Sihle Zikalala immediately asked him to cease his query. He also directed others to enquire later. Provincial chairperson David Mabuza emerged as the favourite for the position of deputy president, after he took 434 branch nominations. Human settlements minister Lindiwe Sisulu followed with 68. For the position of national chairperson, Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa took 358 nominations, while secretary general Gwede Mantashe took 190. The PGC continues on Tuesday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
