Iavan Pijoos Giyani - A 37-year-old Johannesburg Metro Police officer will spend Christmas behind bars after he was arrested for attempted murder in Giyani, Limpopo on Monday.  The officer, Robert Mokgobi, allegedly stole a service firearm and travelled to Giyani on December 2, police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Robert Netshiunda said on Tuesday.

Mokgobi never bothered to report the matter, but fled the scene and returned to Johannesburg," Netshiunda said.  Police launched a manhunt for the officer.  He later fled Johannesburg to Giyani, but was arrested on his arrival, Netshiunda added. Mokgobi appeared in the Giyani Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. the case was postponed to December 27 for a formal bail application. JMPD spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said the department was unaware of the incident. "JMPD Internal Affairs Unit will start investigation with immediate effect, so that he can appear before a disciplinary hearing if the suspect, in fact, is a JMPD officer," Minnaar said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
