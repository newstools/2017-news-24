KZN EMS spokesperson Robert McKenzie said there was a crash involving seven vehicles at the Caltex at Van Reneen which resulted in two deaths and several injuries.  In a separate incident just two kilometres away, two trucks collided resulting in one death. "The entire road had to be closed for recovery. [The] N3 [is] closed indefinitely at this stage," said McKenzie. There has also been a diesel spillage on the N3 from a tanker that was leaking.  "At the top of Van Reenen’s Pass, in a southbound direction, a four-kilometre diesel spill is compounding the traffic problems currently being experienced. "Mop up operations are under way - all resources have been deployed, and good progress is being made, but it is expected to take a few hours before the entire route can be cleared and re-opened to traffic," said McKenzie.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
