	     Cape Town – A paraglider was taken to hospital after suffering serious injuries while paragliding on Little Lions Head, above Llandudno in Cape Town, Wilderness Search and Rescue (WSAR) said on Friday. WSAR spokesperson Johann Marais said a team was called out at about 11:13 on Friday. "All reports indicated that the person had been seriously injured," he said. The paraglider was airlifted to Groote Schuur Hospital at about 13:06. "Authorisation was requested to make use of Skymed (a helicopter). Skymed collected a paramedic and a technical rescuer from the Pinelands Rescue Base at 11:45," he said. He said while the paramedics attended to the patient, the Skymed helicopter "burnt off more fuel to lighten the craft to be able to safely lift the patient". The man was first taken to the Hout Bay NSRI station, "where paramedics attempted to further stabilise the patient". "A decision was then made to take the patient by helicopter to Groote Schuur Hospital," he said. It was not immediately clear how the incident happened. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
