	     Bloemfontein – Free State police officers have been urged to consult with counsellors, their local churches or parents if they are experiencing challenges in their marriages, work or personal life. This comes after a 36-year-old policeman shot his 30-year-old wife dead, before turning his service pistol on himself in F-Section, Botshabelo on Friday morning. Colonel Thandi Mbambo said the police officer's sister woke up and found a suspicious message from her brother. She went to his house to investigate and discovered the bodies. "On arrival at the house in F-Section in Botshabelo, she found the bodies of her brother and his wife in the bedroom and she alerted police," said Mbambo. Police found that the wife had three bullet wounds - two in the chest and one in her head, Mbambo said. "And the 36-year-old member, who was attached to the provincial trio task team, was found with a bullet wound to his head. An official firearm was also found at the scene," she said. The motive for the killing was unknown. Mbambo said police were investigating a murder. An inquest docket has also been opened.
