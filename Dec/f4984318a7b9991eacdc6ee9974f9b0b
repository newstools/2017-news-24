	     Mazowe – Heavily armed
Zimbabwean soldiers are reportedly still deployed at former first lady Grace
Mugabe's farming empire which she controversially acquired in Mazowe. According to New
Zimbabwe.com, an army tanker and several military trucks can be seen in the
area, while a giant military tent has also been erected.   "… the military police
continue to maintain a heavy presence near Grace Mugabe's farm, orphanage and
private school," the report said.  In July, Grace reportedly moved to expand her Mazowe
"empire" in Mashonaland province by grabbing the "iconic
state-owned Mazowe Dam - almost a century after it was built - and surrounding
tracts of land".  The Zimbabwe Independent,
reported at the time that the move heightened Grace's "bitter fights with
local villagers", who were now barred from using the huge dam, as she also
wanted to privatise it. The then first lady's growing
empire already included a huge double-storey mansion, a dairy farm, an
orphanage and a school. She also planned on building a
university. New Zimbabwe.com said that the
Mugabes were believed to own an estimated eight farms in Mazowe alone. These
included; Iron Mask Estate, Gushungo Dairies, Mapfeni Farm, Sigaru Farm, Gwebi
Woods Farm and Gwina Farm.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
