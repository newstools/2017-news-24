	     Beirut - Rebels shot down a Syrian regime helicopter Friday in a southwestern region near the borders with Israel and Lebanon, killing its two crew members, a monitoring group said. "Rebel groups shot down a regime helicopter with a guided missile near the border with Lebanon and the (Israeli-) occupied Golan," said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights chief Rami Abdel Rahman. He told AFP that both officers on board were killed. The area where the helicopter was taken down is an enclave controlled by Islamist rebel and jihadist groups but surrounded by regime forces. Abdel Rahman said the fighting has increased there since October. More than 340 000 people are estimated to have been killed in the Syrian war, which began in 2011 as the regime brutally crushed anti-government protests. Millions have been displaced. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
