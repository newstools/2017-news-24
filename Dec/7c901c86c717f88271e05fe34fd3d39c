A STERN warning is being sent to stokvel members to deposit cash into their bank account to avoid becoming victims of robberies this festive season.  This is after a woman in Verulam was robbed of R50 000 cash from her stokvel club at her home on December 8.  According to the police report, three armed suspects entered the victim’s house and demanded cash.  SAPS Verulam spokesperson Captain Henry Kisten said the suspects searched the premises and found a black bag containing R50 000 that was kept under the mattress.  “The victim withdrew the money [the day before the alleged robbery] to distribute to the members of the club the following day. It’s shocking to note that the public still falls prey to these types of crimes despite numerous warnings about not carrying large sums of cash.  “We urge the public to deposit stokvel money into their bank account either by cellphone banking or transfer,” Kisten said. At the time of going to press no arrests had been made. - Supplied. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
