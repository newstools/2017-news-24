	     Port Elizabeth – Land invaders, who had set up residence on municipal land in Wells Estate and Motherwell, will now be remunerated for their damaged belongings, after their informal dwellings were demolished. The controversial motion, which was tabled by ANC councillor Rory Riordan, and seconded by Mkhuseli Ntsila of the United Front (UF), was passed during the city’s final council meeting on Thursday. The same council meeting saw mayor Athol Trollip and Council Speaker, Jonathan Lawack, survive motions of no confidence brought against them. READ: Trollip survives motion of no confidence Riordan’s motion had five items, namely:  Before the motion was tabled, city manager Johann Mettler labelled the motion as incompetent and warned that any reimbursement would be deemed fruitless and wasteful expenditure, and that councillors could be held personally liable. Despite his warning, the motion carried, with 60 votes in favour, with the ANC (49), EFF (6), UDM (2), PA (1), AIC (1) and UF (1) voting in favour. The DA (57) and ACDP (1) voted against the motion, with each councillor noting their individual objection. Siyasanda Sijadu of the Congress of the People (COPE) abstained from voting. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
