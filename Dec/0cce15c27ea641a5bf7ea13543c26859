IT has been almost 23 years into democracy of a new government and we are still faced with radical oppression of another.     These are things I ask myself: has the apartheid ended or not? What is really going on that we as the citizens of South Africa don’t know about? We have been hearing empty promises for too long from the opposition while the most corrupt leadership dissolves its nation.      Earlier this week I was faced with a horrible experience of being racially mocked on for being an Indian.     The security at the mall would not allow me in to use the ATM simply because I am an “Indian.’ Is this the free South Africa we live in today? Awaiting an order for takeout in the rain, I sat in the car for about 20 minutes until surprisingly I noticed the doors of the mall opened to allow two young women who were of a different race. Immediately I approached the security guards and they ignored me. I tapped on the glass window to get their attention as they ignored my presence as if I was invisible.     After sometime they did come out and open the doors when they heard that I was going to report their behavior and inform the centre management. Sadly after so many years of struggle oppression and racism still exists. We do not need equality as a nation to grow we need equity.
