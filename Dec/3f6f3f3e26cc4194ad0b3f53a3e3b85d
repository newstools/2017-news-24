	     Harare – Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa's newly appointed
deputies – Constantino Chiwenga and Kembo Mohadi – are set to be sworn-in today
at state house in Harare, reports say. Zimbabwe's
state-run media reported on Wednesday that new Mnangagwa had appointed the
country's former military commander as one of his two vice presidents. An AP report said that the naming
of Chiwenga deepened concerns among some in the southern African nation about
the military's close ties with Mnangagwa, who took power last month after
Chiwenga led a military takeover. The dramatic events forced longtime
leader Robert Mugabe, then the world's oldest head of state, to resign after 37
years in power. Mnangagwa over the weekend
appointed Chiwenga and Mohadi as vice presidents of the ruling Zanu-PF party. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
