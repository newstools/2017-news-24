	     Pretoria – Zimbabwean
President Emmerson Mnangagwa has revealed how he walked for more 30km to cross
the border between Zimbabwe and Mozambique in an apparent escape from his
assassination by former president Robert Mugabe's "hunting dogs", reports said
on Friday. Mnangagwa said this on
Thursday in Pretoria where he addressed Zimbabwean nationals, who fled economic
decline and political turmoil in the southern African country. "I came here to pay homage to my brother
President Jacob Zuma. I spent a good 16 days as a 'Diasporan' here in South
Africa after walking some 30km crossing the border into Mozambique.
After I had been fired around 4 o’clock (on November 6), intelligence had made
me aware of the next move intended to eliminate me," NewsDay quoted Mnangagwa as
saying. "Fortunately, I found a [business] card
in my wallet which bore the name of a colleague here, (Justice) Maphosa, whom I
phoned and he picked me. I came here and I was well-looked after." Mnangagwa fled to South Africa
after Mugabe dismissed him during factional fighting in Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party. The firing prompted a backlash against Mugabe and Mnangagwa returned to
Zimbabwe, where he was sworn in as president. Mnangagwa's finance minister
Patrick Chinamasa said that the president had been stripped of his security "both
physically and at his house" immediately after his sacking from government. "This showed his security was
not guaranteed, hence, he had to become a refugee here [South Africa]," said Chinamasa. Mnangagwa also revealed that he had been in "clandestine" communication with
President Jacob Zuma during his stay in South Africa, a New Zimbabwe.com report said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
