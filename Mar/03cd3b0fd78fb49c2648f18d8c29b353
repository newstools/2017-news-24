They got married on July 22, 1998.Ramogibe allegedly received death threats after marrying Buthelezi and was told to leave her. He opened an attempted murder case before his murder.Ramogibe was shot and killed and no one had been convicted as yet. Charges of murder against Mdluli and his co-accused were withdrawn earlier.At the time, Mdluli was the station commander at the Vosloorus police station in Boksburg, east of Johannesburg, and was accused of sabotaging the investigation.News24 previously reported the charges against them stem from the alleged extreme lengths that Mdluli went to between 1997 and 1999 to find out where Buthelezi and Ramogibe were hiding.Mdluli previously testified during cross-examination there were senior people who were part of a project, Ulibambe Lingashoni, set up to "advance their agenda against him".Mdluli claims that the operation was intended to "falsely incriminate him and pull him down".He also said witnesses were found and put in witness protection "in order to coach them to falsely prosecute me".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
