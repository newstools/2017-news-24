THE Rocky Bay Resort trails, on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast, near Park Rynie, will be hosting the “Trails for Tahlia” event on 12 March. Everyone is invited to take part - mountain bike riders, walkers and runners and supporters are also welcome. The event is being held to raise funds for Tahlia-Nia Smith who was diagnosed with microcephaly at only 10 weeks old. She is deaf and suffers from cerebral palsy. Trails will be accessible all day. There is a 19km ride that starts at 8am or a six-kilometre walk at 8.15am for R100 entry fees or a four-kilometre family fun walk or run at 8.30am for R40 entry. Registration is at 7am on the day. There will be lucky draws and prizes as well as jumping castles and face painting for the children. Microcephaly is a rare neurological condition in which a baby’s head is much smaller than that of another. It is believed she contracted the rubella­ virus in the first trimester and as a result suffered extensive injury to her brain stem, midbrain and cortex. Tahlia has seizures every day. Despite her condition, Thalia endures and loves to be tickled and treated like any other child. By the age of four Tahlia had already undergone four major operations. A cochlear implant surgery, adductor muscle lengthening surgery, a failed painful femoral osteotomy, which resulted in a body cast which covered 80% of her body for seven weeks) and a Nissen fundoplication operation because of the full shaft acid reflux. Her parents, Michelle and Corné, have said that despite all of these threats to their daughter’s well-being, she remains a gloriously happy little girl who is hungry for growth and loves reading. The greatest threat at present is her mobility, but funds are really running low. The normal day-to-day living expenses have now placed her parents under huge financial strain as the result of the build-up of debt due to medical costs, travelling and medical equipment. They have put their house on the market, but this won’t help in covering the huge costs. Corne’s sister, a Scottburgh local, Neline Sutherland, came up with a plan. In conjunction with Rocky Bay Resorts, friends and family they will be hosting a walk, run, cycle fun day to raise much needed funds to assist her family. For further information, contact Neline on 081 789 3896 or Janet Simpkins on 083 288 0091. Funds raised will go to Tahlia’s treatment and medical costs.                                    - Supplied.
