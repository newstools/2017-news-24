The breakfast club is facilitated by Mama Ntombi Community Projects, which is a beneficiary of Community Chest working in the Ezinketheni information settlement.This year, Cowling is committed to raising R40 000, which will go towards building two extra classrooms for a cr che, Selby Msimang, in Edendale. Building additional classrooms will ensure that the 120 children at the cr che have the space they need to learn and grow. The centre may even be able to apply for an increase in its state subsidy, which would result in more funds for the children.For more information or to donate, contact Angie Narayanan at 033 394 1031 or e-mail chestpro@communitychest.org.za - Supplied.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
