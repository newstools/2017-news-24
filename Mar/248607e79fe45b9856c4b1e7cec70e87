Guterres, who took over from Ban Ki-moon on January 1, is considering a series of new appointments of envoys who represent him in missions worldwide.The move came after Guterres spoke by phone to Morocco's King Mohamed V1 earlier this month to ask him to pull back troops from a zone in the contested Western Sahara.Ross, an American who served as US ambassador to Algeria and Syria, had been harshly criticised by Morocco who accused him of being biased in favour of the Polisario Front.Morocco maintains that Western Sahara is an integral part of its kingdom despite a UN resolution that calls for a referendum on the future of the territory. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
