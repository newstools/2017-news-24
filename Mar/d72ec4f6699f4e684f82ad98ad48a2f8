Montalto is of the view that Brian Molefe, reportedly favoured by President Jacob Zuma, would be the most likely candidate to replace Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.&nbsp; However, we don t believe any candidate will be market-positive. President Zuma is taking a very large, though calculated, risk here that his majority within the National Executive (NEC) does not fracture and that a rebel ANC caucus in parliament does not manage to remove him. As such, this will be a real test of his stock of political capital and the lack of action of his opponents (until now at least), Montalto said. &nbsp;READ: SACP statement on discussions with ANC https://t.co/jI1VPQdyYd via @News24Mapaila says the SACP rejects corruption and the abuse of state organs.&nbsp;#SACP Mapaila: it&#39;s corruption on steroids, abuse of state organs on steroids @News24Mapaila: "The decision to pull out of the alliance, it's a bigger decision. It's a decision that will not come lightly, because it's a decision that could destroy this revolution.

Because the impression created was that we agreed, but we didn't agree."&nbsp;#SACP Mapaila: really pathetic, to believe a minister with a delegation to go lure investments for the SA is a trip against the country?#SACP Mapaila: the leadership must be able to come out openly, be above factions &amp; unify the movement @News24#SACP Mapaila says treasury must be handled with care. &quot;Can&#39;t allow the parasites &amp; vultures to encircle it&quot; @news24#SACP on claims by intelligence report that Gordhan went to London to discredit the president,&quot;how can we believe that, we are not children&quot;Mapaila will make public another intelligence report, 41 pages.(With claims against Zuma and Gupta&#39;s UK-based PR firm Bell Pottinger) #SacpMeanwhile, at Parliament...&nbsp;President Jacob #Zuma arriving for the debate on his speech to the national house of traditional leaders. @News24 pic.twitter.com/S3z9Pz4lPZMapaila: A country like ours can&#39;t allow gross mistakes like the recent ones which cause it to lose so much money! #SACPMapaila mentions the Guptas.&nbsp;#SACP JUST IN: Mapaila holds up another &quot;intelligence report,&quot; says that, &quot;we recieved it anonymously &amp; will distribute it openly.&quot;Mapaila: We reject the intended reshuffle, including the motives for it. #SACP#SACP want abuse of intelligence to be be addressed immediately.
