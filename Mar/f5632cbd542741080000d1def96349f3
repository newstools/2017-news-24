the number of deaths from the disease in Zimbabwe since October, the health
ministry says. Eighty-six cases of typhoid were reported in just one week
beginning March 5, the ministry says in its latest update. Typhoid cases haven't just been confined to Harare: there
are also typhoid infections in Hurungwe, about 120km from the capital,
and Mazowe, which lies about 85km away. Recent heavy rains across much of the country have raised
fears of intensified disease outbreaks. Typhoid flourishes in the kind of
conditions that are seen in parts of Zimbabwe's capital, where rubbish is
infrequently collected, piped water supply is not reliable and there are often
burst sewage pipes. One person died of cholera in Chiredzi in southern Zimbabwe,
the state broadcaster reported on Tuesday. Floods and heavy rains have also caused a spike in malaria cases. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
