If each sheet contained four bond notes that would give a total of $2 680 worth of notes soon to be released onto Zimbabwe's cash-starved market, if the report is true.There have been concerns about the security of the bond notes, currently available in denominations of 2 US and 5 US (a 1 US bond coin is also in circulation). The 2 US bond notes are green, but the green colour rubs off easily. There were claims that the notes were being faked even before they were introduced.President Robert Mugabe said at his 93rd birthday party on Saturday that the notes were only "temporary". But with reports that the authorities plan soon to introduce the bills in denominations of 10 US and 20 US, there are fears they'll go the way of Zimbabwe's bearer cheques in the pre-2009 era and quickly be rendered worthless.While in theory bond notes have no value outside Zimbabwe, they are being traded on online auction site Ebay where sellers are asking up to $7.59 for a 2 US bond note24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
