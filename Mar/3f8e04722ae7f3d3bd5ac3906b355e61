in eastern Zimbabwe for allegedly swallowing gems had to pick through their
excrement to find them, it was reported on Friday. The three, all employed by the
Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company, have told a court in Mutare that they
were forced to eat a diet of "groundnuts and fresh milk only for
days" which brought on diarrhea, the Manica Post reports. The men were arrested early in
the morning of March 5 after a security guard said he saw them swallowing
diamonds as they worked on a blocked conveyor belt in Chiadzwa, Zimbabwe's rich
dry gem fields that were the site of a military crackdown in late 2008. Defence lawyer Chris Ndlovu was
quoted as saying: "The police would also force them to excrete in buckets
while they watched them thereby denying them their right to privacy." The three were taken for X-rays
at a local hospital, where "foreign bodies" were seen. They were granted $200 bail this week even though they had not excreted any diamonds, the
Manica Post said. The Zimbabwe Consolidated
Diamond Company is a state-owned diamond firm formed when President Robert
Mugabe's government said private companies operating in Chiadzwa had to stop
mining and merge. The move was resisted by some firms. In 2015, a Zimbabwe man was
caught at the border post linking Mutare to Mozambique with 72 diamonds in his
