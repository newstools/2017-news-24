We must take this defence of democracy to the streets,&rdquo; the group said, announcing a march to Pretoria on Friday.Zwelinzima Vavi, under his new party, the South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU), will also be marching to Treasury on Friday.Zuma announced a Cabinet reshuffle in the early hours of Friday, firing five ministers and appointing a host of new deputies.- Follow the Live Update here.Save SA said it was now time to fight.&ldquo;It is therefore a Gupta coup and final confirmation &ndash; for those who needed it &ndash; that our President, our government and our country have been captured by compradors intent on destroying our democracy,&rdquo; Save SA said in a statement.&ldquo;We are urging every woman and man, old or young, to make their way to Pretoria and assemble at Church Square, outside the National Treasury, at 10am today to show their objection to this Gupta-inspired coup.&rdquo;They called on South Africans to bring flags, and for family and friends and occupy central Pretoria.This was the only way, the group said, to &ldquo;stop the capture of National Treasury, and prevent the Gupta proxies from getting access to our money&rdquo;.'Thieves and looters given a green light'Vavi said SAFTU was outraged at Zuma's Cabinet reshuffle and appealed to all South Africans to flood the streets of Pretoria and symbolically occupy the Treasury in the strongest possible protest. &ldquo;The thieves and looters have been given a green light to continue and increase their manipulation of government and SOE contracts to line their pockets for as long as we allow them to get away with it,&rdquo; the federation said in a statement on Friday.&ldquo;If the Zuma faction continues what they are doing it will leave us with a country mortgaged to the Guptas and/or to the Russian, French, Chinese or Americans capitalists through things like the nuclear deal.&rdquo;Vavi was quick to make it clear that their campaign was different from the ones led by capitalists exploiting workers.&ldquo;We will not defend any ANC or alliance factions who are guilty of implementing austerity measures and neoliberal programmes, which have led to the worsening material conditions of the working class. We are not backing any individual or faction but fighting against a monopoly capitalist economic system which is now taking us towards a deadly, corrupt form of crony capitalism.&rdquo;The Congress of South African Trade Unions said it would take time to reflect on the announcement and study the implications of the reshuffle.In his reshuffle, Zuma sacked Pravin Gordhan, Mcebisi Jonas and Derek Hanekom, who on Friday said he had not been informed of the reasons behind the reshuffle.He also moved Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula to police and added a few new entries to the Cabinet.#SAFTU calls on workers and all South Africans to assembly at Church Square at 10:00 #OccupyTreasury its a peaceful demonstrationbringSAflag&mdash; Zwelinzima Vavi (@Zwelinzima1) March 30, 2017Outside the National Treasury, at 10am today to show [our] objection to this Gupta-inspired coup. #savesa #OccupyTreasury https://t.co/LVwBqIUmvv&mdash; Save South Africa (@_SaveSA) March 30, 2017#SAFTU calls on workers and all South Africans to assembly at Church Square at 10:00 #OccupyTreasury its a peaceful demonstrationbringSAflagOutside the National Treasury, at 10am today to show [our] objection to this Gupta-inspired coup. #savesa #OccupyTreasury https://t.co/LVwBqIUmvv24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
