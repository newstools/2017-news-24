As a result, our client has decided to make an application to court to be permitted to intervene in the application and to be joined as a respondent."Letsaolo's attorneys add that he has been left with little time to file court papers and requested that the matter be postponed until next week.Punitive costsIn response, the former board's attorneys denied that Lestaolo had a direct interest in the matter."No relief is sought against your client, nor does any of the relief sought affect your client, in either his official or personal capacity. He has no interest in the order or the outcome of the urgent proceedings," the letter states.The board's attorneys go on to say that Letsoalo's approach "smacks of dilatory tactic and appears designed solely to subvert the hearing of this matter"."It is not open to third parties to seek to prevent an extremely urgent application being heard simply by want of their desire to file papers at some later date."The board cautions that should Letsoalo approach the court to join in as a respondent, he should not prevent the proceedings from being heard.The former board warned Letsoalo that they will seek punitive costs against him in his personal capacity, and argue for a finding of contempt of court, should he request a delay.The matter is expected to be heard in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria on Thursday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
