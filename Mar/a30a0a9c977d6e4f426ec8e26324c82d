A furious President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday lambasted some 5 000 doctors who have been striking for better pay and working conditions, accusing them of "blackmail"."We will not succumb to threats and intimidation. Do these doctors think we are that stupid? We have offered you better salaries than those in private hospitals!" he said at a joint press conference with Munya.At the root of the doctors' strike is a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) agreed between the government and the unions in 2013.The document promises to triple salaries but also to improve often dire conditions in public hospitals - which striking doctors point to when accused of being greedy.The government said the document was still being fine-tuned but doctors argue it is a legal deal which they want implemented immediately. A Kenyan court which declared the strike illegal appointed church leaders to mediate after several other mediators failed. However even they failed to make headway after the union on Tuesday rejected a 50% salary increase and improved risk allowance.The previous offer had been 40%.Poor working conditions&nbsp;Poor salaries and working conditions - such as a lack of vital drugs and equipment - have pushed Kenyan doctors to flee the public sector or go to other countries where there are better opportunities. Kenya's main doctors' union, KMPDU, says the country has one doctor to 17 000 patients, while the World Health Organisation recommends one to 1 000.University lecturers also went on strike in January, a double blow to Kenyatta's government just five months before general elections.A series of corruption scandals - including in the health ministry - are fuelling the discontent, as is anger towards lawmakers who are among the best paid in the world and have voted themselves new benefits while claiming to be unable to meet doctors' and lecturers' demands.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
