I decide who should be where. So you Makonda, do your job and ignore the rest," he said.Nnauye had visited the broadcaster in the wake of the incident, and launched an immediate probe which wrapped up Wednesday."I have the responsibility of protecting free media and freedom of expression in the country and I would not deserve to be in this position if I fail to do so. I will advise my bosses to take punitive measures against the regional commissioner," he said.The probe team chairman, Deodatus Balile, said that Makonda had threatened station staff with blackmail and jail if they didn't air the programme.Magufuli, whose nickname "tingatinga" means "bulldozer" in Swahili, swept to power as a no-nonsense, corruption-busting, man-of-the-people.However critics see a wide authoritarian streak at the core of his populism, as he acts on impulse regardless of due process or political niceties, while being intolerant to any dissent."Since the inauguration of President Magufuli, attacks on freedom of the press have increased in a worrying manner," said Clea Kahn-Sriber, Africa head at pressure group Reporters Without Borders, known by its French acronym RSF."To legitimise this type of behaviour towards the media is to undermine the fundamental freedoms of all Tanzanians to express themselves and to be informed freely," she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
