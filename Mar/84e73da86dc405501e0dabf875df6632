"We hold him in our hearts and prayers as he embarks on the journey to full recovery," Nkosi Zwelivelile Mandla Mandela of the Royal House of Mandela said in a statement. Mandela said during this difficult time for Kathrada and his family the house recognised the role Kathrada played in developing SA. "In these difficult times that we are traversing as a nation, we are reminded of his wisdom when he said that 'hatred, revenge, bitterness. These are negative emotions. The person harbouring them suffers more'," Mandela said. "We would do well as a nation to learn and derive lessons from his wisdom when he said: 'In death, you once more challenge people from every strata, religion and position to think about how their own actions can change the world for better or worse.'" Mandela called on South Africans to honour Kathrada's contribution by dedicating their lives to the cause of changing the country and the world for the better. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
