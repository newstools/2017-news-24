So VIVA to the ice-cream sellers!"Fransman said he challenged Mantashe to stop "bullying activists on the ground" like Lungisa."I will become an ice-cream salesman if comrade Mantashe can stop bringing dishonour to the same office that was so eloquently held by others, not least the one that we honour this year, OR Tambo!"Mantashe was not immediately available for comment.READ: Marius Fransman's ode to Andile Lungisa'Breaking Lungisa's spirit'On Thursday, Fransman - who was suspended by the party following allegations of sexual harassment in 2016 - bemoaned the "abuse of the ANC constitution".He urged the party not to break Lungisa's spirit. Fransman sent a message to Lungisa on his Facebook page, as well as in a statement to the media."Today my status [goes] to a young, highly intelligent, very pragmatic, very grounded, analytical and visionary young man that held very senior positions at a young age, including deputy president of YL, president of Pan African Youth, and now chairperson of a region, comrade Andile Lungisa," Fransman's praises began.Fransman, who is fighting his suspension from the party, used the opportunity to again hit out at Mantashe, who he has previously accused of being part of a group that masterminded his downfall."I will never believe that the constitution must be used as a draconian tool to get rid of people for political expediency."He called on Lungisa not to despair and not to blame the organisation for what he was facing.He offered Lungisa an apology "as a cadre and as a leader" for what he said was a humiliating experience. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
