He pleaded not guilty to killing sex worker Nokuphila Kumalo in Woodstock in April 2013.In December, questions were raised about Mthethwa's decision not to testify during his trial.Both his lawyer William Booth and prosecutor Christhenus van der Vijver agreed during closing arguments that he had a right to remain silent and that doing so was not a sign of guilt.A psychiatrist testified last week that Mthethwa had no recollection of events that night, possibly due to alcohol consumption.Mthethwa did not hand in a plea explanation or testify in his own defence.Van der Vijver cautioned that if the case was not sufficiently answered, it could have consequences for Mthethwa.Kumalo is believed to have died from blunt force trauma.Mthethwa is alleged to have kicked her repeatedly. The State alleged he was caught on CCTV camera as he parked his Porsche in Ravenscraig Road, Woodstock.In a statement, the ANC Women's League said it is greatly concerned that it has taken two years for the murder trial to be concluded."If the [judicial] system is serious on discouraging perpetrators from committing these cruel acts of violence and gruesome murder of women, harsher sentences must [be] imposed," the league added.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
