If land was transferred to people legally, no one would go hungry, as all types of foods would be produced.'Who has benefitted?'Kgoshi Thobejane told Zuma very little had been done to restore the dignity of the Khoi, San, and Nama people. He said colonisers had brutalised them the most.He questioned who had benefitted from mining."We cannot forever be the beneficiary of the dust of mining. We need to benefit from the real production."As long as land was not accessible to traditional leaders, and had not been transferred back to the people, they would never achieve "all these things", he said.He called on government to fast-track the transfer of the land to its original owners.Zuma would respond to their statements later on Thursday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
