Johannesburg - Eighty-seven year old Ahmed Kathrada, affectionately known as 'Kathy' by those close to him, has died. Kathrada underwent surgery relating to a blood clot on the brain earlier this month but experienced several postoperative complications and contracted pneumonia, which affected both his lungs. Kathrada will be remembered, for the most part, as one of the eight iconic men including Nelson Mandela, Govan Mbeki, Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ray Mhlaba, Dennis Goldberg and Elias Motsoaledi who were arrested at Liliesleaf Farm and found guilty on charges including conspiracy and sabotage during the famous Rivonia Trial held at the Palace of Justice in Pretoria in 1963. Kathrada was one of those sentenced to life in prison and hard labour at Robben Island. The stalwart will be remembered as an ardent supporter of human rights, for his patriotism and his special love for young people.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
