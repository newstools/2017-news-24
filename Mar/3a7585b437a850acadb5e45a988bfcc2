Tammy Petersen, News24 Cape Town - A Twitter account from which Social Development
Minister Bathabile Dlamini ostensibly tweeted “Greeting all South Africans. I
am still the Minister of Social Development” on Friday, has been dismissed as a
fake. Her spokesperson Lumka Oliphant said in a statement that she
has no Facebook or Twitter accounts, as both were deactivated in January last
year. Dlamini distanced herself from the accounts which were
illegally set up in her name. “We will not be detracted from our mandate to drive
government’s social assistance programme and improve the living conditions of
poor, vulnerable and underprivileged South Africans.” One account, @Batha_Dlamini, states under a picture of the
minister that she is: “South Africa's Minister of Social Development. President
of the ANCWL”.  Greeting all South Africans. I am still the Minister of Social Development ? #Cabinetreshuffle pic.twitter.com/mIJeXEnx8c  Numerous tweets on the ANC, the Sassa debacle, and the OR
Tambo International Airport heist were made from the account. All official communication from the department was published
on its official Facebook page, Twitter handle @The_DSD and @socialdevelopmentza
on Instagram.  Saying I'm a drunkard and swearing at me won't solve any of the issues we have as a country 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
