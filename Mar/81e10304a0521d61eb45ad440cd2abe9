Nevertheless, better late than never."Its first order of business must be to conduct a disciplinary inquiry into former chief executive Hlaudi Motsoeneng, as directed by the Western Cape High Court, she said.FinancesShe urged President Jacob Zuma to approve the names as soon as possible.UDM MP Nqabayomzi Kwankwa said the new board has its work cut out for it."It also has to ensure that the SABC is not mindless but deliberate."ACDP MP Steve Swart, who also served as a member of the ad hoc committee that looked into affairs at the SABC, said the public broadcaster's finances need to be deeply scrutinised.An ANC MP said Parliament's task was to exercise effective oversight over the interim board and that they hoped all parties could do it together."I hope as the ANC we can travel this road together, in making sure we have clean governance."Muthambi slammedBoth Singh and Van Damme slammed Communications Minister Faith Muthambi's intention to take the separate ad hoc committee report on the SABC on review.Singh said "all members of this House except the United Democratic Movement" supported the ad hoc committee report, and there were internal processes she should have followed before "running to the courts"."I think it is showing disdain for this... House," he said.Van Damme spoke out strongly against Muthambi's intention to fight the ad hoc committee's report and said the committee will fight tooth and nail for its recommendations. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
