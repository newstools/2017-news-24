We will also inform the minister to ensure they receive houses," Booi said."We want to restore that dignity, it is an insult not to be recognised, it is that sense of pride that we want to restore."There are some veterans staying under bridges. That is an insult."Booi said Cape Town was the first region to register outstanding veterans."Next there will be the Boland, then another region until we reach the entire Western Cape," he said."We want to make sure that every single cadre is there. We know that we have limited reach and call on everyone to help us to tell veterans to come."If someone is unable to come, we want to make an effort for that person," Booi said.Registration is set to take place from 08:00 on Saturday morning.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
