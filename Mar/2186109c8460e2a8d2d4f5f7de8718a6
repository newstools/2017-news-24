Police say several people have been detained for questioning after the attack on Friday. Youths smashed a store front on the ground floor of the party headquarters in Athens on a busy road during rush hour traffic, and threw red paint at the entrance of the building. Founded as a neo-Nazi group in the 1980s, Golden Dawn came third in the 2015 general elections, with a surge in popular support during the country's major financial crisis. Party offices have been targeted in the past in bomb attacks, while two Golden Dawn members were shot dead in 2013, an attack claimed by a far-left militant group. Party spokesperson Ilias Kasidiaris accused the government of turning a blind eye to attacks against Golden Dawn. "They think that with terrorism and petrol bombs they will stop Golden Dawn. Golden Dawn will not be stopped and it is the only force that is standing up to the selling out of Greece," he said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
