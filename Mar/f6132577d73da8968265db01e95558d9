Burundi, one of the world's poorest countries, has a population of about 11 million.The malaria cases are "well beyond the epidemic threshold," the report said, citing World Health Organisation investigators.The outbreak is the latest crisis for Burundi, which has been wracked by deadly political violence since 2015 and faces food shortages that the UN says have left nearly 1 in 10 people severely food insecure.The political crisis began with President Pierre Nkurunziza's ultimately successful decision in April 2015 to seek a third term, which critics called unconstitutional. Hundreds have been killed, and more than 380 000 Burundians have fled into neighboring countries.The UN estimates that the number of people affected by food insecurity increased from 2.1 million to 3 million between October and January, the report said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
