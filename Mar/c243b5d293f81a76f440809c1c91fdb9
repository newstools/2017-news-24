They will get their grant on the 1st of April and we are sure about that," Dlamini said.The minister, however, would not say how, or who would be paying these grants, and instead again said they had not reached a deal with current service provider Cash Paymaster Services (CPS).This spotlight on Sassa is due to continue, with Parliament to deal with a draft resolution by the IFP's Liezel van der Merwe on the looming South African Social Services Agency grant payments crisis. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
