WATCHCape Town - A meeting between the Office of the Chief Justice and Parliament's justice committee has been cancelled following the robbery at the Office of the Chief Justice.The Office of the Chief Justice was due to brief the committee on judicial administration and the annual performance plan on Thursday.Committee chairperson Dr Mathole Motshekga said the Office of the Chief Justice had requested a postponement after 15 computers were stolen from the office, in Midrand, on Saturday morning."Due to the robbery at the weekend at the Office of the Chief Justice, the committee felt the request is not unwarranted and agreed to the request for a postponement," Motshekga said.Democratic Alliance MP Glynnis Breytenbach said the party was stunned and angered by the cancellation."It seems that some on the justice committee would prefer to stick their heads in the sand rather than urgently discuss the deeply troubling break-in at the Office of the Chief Justice, which can only be viewed as an attack on the judiciary."They party would write to Motshekga to again ask that the ministers of police, state security, and the Office of the Chief Justice appear urgently before the committee to account for the robbery."This is simply unacceptable," she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
