Roughly 30 emergency personnel searched through rubble to find people injured.&nbsp;The provincial government confirmed that six people suffered minor to major injuries and were taken to nearby hospitals for medical attention.&nbsp;No casualties were reported.&nbsp;Contractor blamedCo-operative governance MEC Jacob Mamabolo, who is responsible for infrastructure, blamed the roof's collapse on shoddy workmanship by contractors waterproofing the roof.&nbsp;"The way they were removing the concrete stone, we could see they did not do a proper check on the strength of the building or the roof itself," he said.&nbsp;Mamabolo said the contractor removed concrete stones and placed them on a thin roof that could not handle the weight, resulting in the roof's collapse.&nbsp;Eyewitness on the scene said they are not surprised that the roof collapsed as there were leaks everywhere.&nbsp;DA provincial spokesperson on health Jack Bloom sent out a statement in 2016 in which he expressed concern over the structural integrity of the building. &nbsp;He told News24 on Thursday that he was exceptionally concerned about the stability of the roof after the recent rains.&nbsp;"This could have been avoided," Bloom said.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
