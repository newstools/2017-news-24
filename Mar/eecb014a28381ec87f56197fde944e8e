He said Smith had told him he had done so "to protect himself".Khoisan declined to say who had given him the recording. As an investigative journalist, he said he could not reveal his source, whom he described as credible and strong. He said he no longer knew where the recording was.Khoisan said several steps had been taken to ensure the recording was authentic.He could not be cross-examined immediately because Knipe, who sat in the public gallery watching proceedings earlier this week, was not present on Thursday due to a family issue.Knipe could, therefore, not give instructions to the legal team opposing Lincoln's claim.On Thursday, top cop Major-General Jeremy Vearey was also set to have been called as a witness.But this did not happen. The case is expected to continue on Tuesday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
