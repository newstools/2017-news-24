The opposition also wants the conference to debate the "current governance" of Mali.The implementation of the peace accord has been piecemeal and insurgents who refused to sign the deal are still active across large parts of the country.Mali's north fell under the control of jihadist groups linked to al-Qaeda in 2012 who hijacked the rebel uprising, though the Islamists were largely ousted by a French-led military operation in January 2013.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
