It adopted English as the language of instruction. Previously it had been both English and Afrikaans.Facility co-ordinator Janli Sonntag told Radio 702 the aim was to preserve Christian values and Afrikaans culture. She rejected claims that its policy was discriminatory.She said other students on campus had recently targeted Afrikaans-speaking students because of their language and accused them of being racist.The residence, she said, was a place where Afrikaans students could "feel safe and passionate about their language, not be victimised or mocked, where they can feel at home".Sonntag insisted that the residence's policy was not racist and could not be compared to apartheid.The residence's policy has sparked calls on social media for the SA Human Rights Commission to investigate it.University spokesperson Candice Jooste said they had no control of the residence&rsquo;s policy as it was privately-owned."The university does not condone accommodation facilities that use race as a selection criteria," she said.#DeGoodeHoop @mantoa_selepe and I have written to the @CRL_Commission to urgently probe this residence. pic.twitter.com/dOdPG7nMsv&mdash; Yusuf Abramjee (@Abramjee) March 23, 2017#DeGoodeHoop @mantoa_selepe and I have written to the @CRL_Commission to urgently probe this residence. pic.twitter.com/dOdPG7nMsv* This story has been updated to remove a tweet 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
