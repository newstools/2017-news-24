Despite several attempts, News24 failed to reach his spokesperson Gugu Ndima.&nbsp;On Thursday, the SANDF said it would only start trying to find Thole once an assessment of the mine shaft had been completed. The SA Military Health Services' Colonel William Bucibe said at the time that they met a team of experts to decide on a plan.The SANDF, Masina, Mine Rescue Services and Ekurhuleni Disaster and Emergency Management Services were involved in the rescue effort, in the Jerusalem informal settlement. Richard Thole fell into the shaft Saturday afternoon, February 25.On Wednesday, Ekurhuleni Disaster and Emergency Management Services&rsquo; spokesperson William Ntladi said heavy rock falls had delayed efforts to find Thole.Last week, Mine Rescue Services sent a camera down the shaft three times. Each time it got caught between a pile of rocks on a ledge at a depth of 60m.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
