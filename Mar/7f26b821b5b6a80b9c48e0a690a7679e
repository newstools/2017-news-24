The Sowetan reported on Tuesday that Netcare Linksfield Hospital had dismissed the nurse for criticising Zuma and his wife, as well as revealing details of her medical treatment, which goes against the health profession's rules. The nurse posted that "10 very expensive black cars plus cops on motor bikes" arrived at the hospital, preventing other customers from seeing their loved ones. "I'm disgusted. We pay for his wife's and his children. Why are they better than the tax paying South Africans. Zuma you are a disgrace to this country. I wished it was you in hospital dying of a heart attack [sic]," the post read.The Facebook post has since been removed, The Times reported.Hospital manager Louis Vanderhoven told the Sowetan that the nurse defied a code of practice and contravened legislation and company policies. The company was also "deeply embarrassed" by the personal opinion expressed by the staff member. Netcare chief executive Dr Richard Friedland personally wrote to Zuma and his wife, following the "most regrettable incident", and apologised unreservedly. The matter would also be reported to the South African Nursing Council and the police. Zuma's spokesperson did not comment on the incident.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
