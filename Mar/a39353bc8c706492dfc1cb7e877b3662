There will also be "monthly airtime bonuses"."When putting together this rewards programme, we analysed the best global rewards practices, as well as what our customers love about the DStv brands," says MultiChoice in a statement slightly adjusted per African country where DStv Thanks was announced."The rewards offered had to provide greater value to our loyal customers beyond the normal, while also providing more motivation to stay loyal to our platform"."We're confident that the rewards we have lined up for DStv Thanks now and in the future will not only enhance our customers' television viewing experience but also solidify their connection to our platforms."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
