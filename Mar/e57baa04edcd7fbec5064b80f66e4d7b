We are saying it is an institution that we have and we can improve it," she said during submissions to the final leg of the Commission of Inquiry into Higher Education and Training (Fees Commission) in Centurion.She went over resolutions the African National Congress had taken since 1994 to improve access to education and the achievement of a progressively free education."We are saying that the ANC and government have made advances in support for students in higher education, but that much more needs to be done in order to be in accord with resolutions and policies adopted by the ANC," she said.There was a need to develop a framework for regulating fees and increase support from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) for poor and "missing middle" students.She called for a review of the current block-grant university funding, and funding for science and engineering students, and artisans to attract and retain young people in these fields.President Jacob Zuma established the commission in January 2016 to investigate the feasibility of free tertiary education.
