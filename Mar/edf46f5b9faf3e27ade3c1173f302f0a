The ANCWL denounces the narrative driven by the opposition that the reshuffle is factional and causing panic that the country is in crisis."'Corrupt business cronies'Government communications acting director-general Donald Liphoko said the government was confident that the new ministers and their deputies would work tirelessly to bring about radical socio-economic transformation and move the country on an upward trajectory. &nbsp;"The appointments made by the president are aligned to improving efficiency and effectiveness in the system and government is confident that the ministers and their deputies will hit the ground running to ensure the continuity of government programmes to realise Vision 2030, which is to eliminate poverty and reduce inequality," he said.In response to the reshuffle, Corruption Watch said the centre of political gravity, and the last hope for the South African democracy, rested with the people of SA and their parliamentary representatives."The events have clearly established that renewal will not come from within the ranks of the ruling party, which has clearly been captured by a narrow clique around the president and his corrupt business cronies."It called on South Africans to make their dissatisfaction known on the streets, in the branches of their political parties, and at the ballot box."And to convey, in no uncertain terms, their rejection of the ruling clique to their elected representatives in their communities, their provinces and their Parliament."'State capture must be stopped'University of Cape Town's Max Price said the reshuffle presented a crisis for good governance in SA."The University of Cape Town calls on members of the campus community to join the public protests planned for today and the next few days to express the nation's call for President Jacob Zuma to restore transparency and accountability to the office of the National President and to abide by the Constitution."Price said the president's actions were simply the most recent in a string of activities that demonstrated contempt for the South Africans he had sworn to serve."State capture must be stopped. South Africans can stop it by demanding an accountable government who abides by the Constitution." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
