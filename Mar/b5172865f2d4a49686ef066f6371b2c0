He died in jail in September before he could stand trial.The death toll from Sierra Leone's civil war is estimated at 120 000 in a country that now has roughly six million people, making it one of Africa's deadliest conflicts in recent history.The government of Sierra Leone has attempted to crack down on cross-border diamond trafficking to persuade foreign investors that "blood diamonds" are a thing of the past.The diamond presented on Thursday, once confirmed by experts, is expected to rank among the largest ever found.A 1 111-carat diamond was discovered at a mine in Botswana in 2015, the biggest find for more than a century.That gem is second in size only to the Cullinan diamond which was unearthed in South Africa in 1905, at 3 106 carats uncut, according to the Cape Town Diamond Museum.The Cullinan was cut into several gems, including two set into the sceptre and crown of the British Crown Jewels.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
