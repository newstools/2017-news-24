It should not be a matter for any discussion. It was unfortunate and indeed regrettable that this matter was subjected to a conference discussion," he told News24."We should have just observed it, and we hope this stops dragging the ANC into negative publicity."Mabuyane said Lungisa's position on the party's provincial council was higher than the regional Nelson Mandela Bay chairpersonship, and the ANC's constitution does not allow for a member to hold two positions of different rank.Lungisa will continue to serve on the provincial council.He said this won't affect any other regional positions in the newly constituted Nelson Mandela Bay&nbsp;leadership.Lungisa was elected along with 23 others to the party's regional leadership on Sunday.The province will constitute a new regional council to elect a new chairperson in due course, Mabuyane added.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
