"During the chaos families were separated and some women were forced to leave their young children behind in Cameroon, including a child less than three years old," he added. The UNHCR said it was particularly alarmed to see that the forced returns were continuing unabated after its previous protests and even after the governments of Nigeria and Cameroon signed an agreement with the UN on March 2 to ensure voluntary returns when possible."While recognising the legitimate national security concerns of the Cameroon government, UNHCR reminds authorities that refugees are themselves fleeing violence and attacks from Boko Haram and that their access to asylum and protection must be ensured," the agency said.Baloch stressed that the forced return of asylum seekers and refugees constitutes refoulement, which is a serious violation of international law.Though Boko Haram was born in Nigeria, the Islamic State-affiliated group has carried out frequent attacks in Cameroon, Chad and Niger, prompting the formation of a regional force to fight back.Some 200 000 Cameroonians from the Far North region near Nigeria have left their villages in fear of the violence.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
