The UDPS "has noted the decision of the biological family... to repatriate his body on March 11, 2017", party spokesperson Augustin Kabuya said.But the interior minister of the provincial government for Kinshasa, Emmanuel Akweti, said that date is "for information purposes only."Akweti has also said the firm building Tshisekedi's memorial site must tell authorities and the family when their work will be finished before the burial can take place.Under the terms of the deal, Kabila would remain in office until elections at the end of 2017 but a transitional council was to be established under Tshisekedi.Kabila has called on the Rassemblement to choose a replacement for Tshisekedi, who would then present three candidates for the post of prime minister.The longer the stalemate continues, "the less likely it is that elections can be organised by the end of 2017," said Philemon Mwamba, a professor of political science at the University of Kinshasa. "Politicians from all sides are not ready to go to elections," he said."As long as the people on the street do not pressure them, we could stay like this for a few years."Tshisekedi led opposition to Laurent Kabila, who took office by force in 1997, followed by his son Joseph who became president after his father's assassination in 2001.Beaten in 2011 elections tainted by massive irregularities, Tshisekedi refused to recognise Kabila's legitimacy to the very last.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
