They want to keep this man in custody because they don't have evidence against him," Kilian said.There was previous speculation that Msimango might be released from police custody over the weekend due to lack of evidence.Spokesperson for acting national police commissioner Kgomotso Phahlane, Athlenda Mathe previously said Msimango has important information on where the 15 computers that were stolen from the chief justice's offices in Midrand were taken.The computers are believed to contain sensitive information about South African judges.Speaking to News24 from the Boschkop police station on Friday, Msimango denied all the allegations."I am willing to work with police in the investigation, but it would be hard as I don't know anything about it," he said.Two other suspects appeared in connection with the case in the Mamelodi Magistrate's Court on Wednesday.They were charged with possession of illegal firearms and forged identity documents.Msimango is expected back in court on Friday, March 31. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
