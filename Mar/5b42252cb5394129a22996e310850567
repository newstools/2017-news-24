Unless you don't believe South Africa [belongs to all],"&nbsp;Lekota said."This Constitution is a product of all of us. The land some people want to take from others, you'll be taking from our grandparents and great-grandparents."We've inherited all of that, the whole country."So please be careful. If you want to take our land from us, to whom are you going to give it?"Historical remindersLekota went through a history lesson of who the original inhabitants of the country were.The Khoi, San, African tribes from the North, Dutch, English, Malay and Phillipino slaves, French Hugenots and German immigrants all contributed to the legacy of the country over centuries.He said coloured people were born as a result of "all of us", in the same way that the Constitution was a product of all of us."They were born here. There is no country called 'coloured land'."The Constitution will never be renegotiated, and a meeting of that magnititude will never happen again, he said.Mbete, Modise, ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu and DA chief whip John Steenhuisen also spoke at the event.Also in attendance was former National Party MP Leon Wessels, the co-chairperson of the Constitution Assembly in the early 1990s.- Read more: Country's fate in your hands, Mbete tells youth on Constitution's 20th anniversaryGuests invited to the event included about 120 students from around the country.
