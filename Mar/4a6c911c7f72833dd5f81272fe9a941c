After that, the Constitutional Court ended its "supervisory" role in the matter.However, Sassa is not ready to take over the grant payments and it has apparently entered into a revised or new contract with CPS to make sure everybody is paid on April 1. It also has a "three-phase plan" to phase out CPS, which could take years.Black Sash said Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan had stated that an extended or new contract with CPS would be unlawful and uncompetitive, because it deviates from procurement processes.He would not sanction it unless the Constitutional Court approved it.Sassa announced that it would approach the court to have the new arrangement approved, but has since withdrawn the application.It said it would just report to the Constitutional Court before the end of March on what it had done.The Black Sash lodged an urgent application with the Constitutional Court so that it could have oversight of the new agreement before it is a "fait accompli".The matter is expected to be heard in Johannesburg on March 15. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
