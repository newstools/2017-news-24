Led by Britain, France and Senegal, the council will meet with leaders, talk to civil society groups and visit camps in Cameroon and northeast Nigeria sheltering some of the 2.3 million people displaced in the region.The visit begins in Cameroon a week after UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres set off alarm bells over the threat of famine in northeast Nigeria, the epicenter of the Boko Haram conflict.The United Nations is seeking $1.5bn in funding for 2017 for the Lake Chad region -- almost half of which is needed for northeast Nigeria, where 5.1m people face acute food shortages.'Perfect storm' of challenges&nbsp;Boko Haram took up arms in 2009 in pursuit of an Islamic state in northern Nigeria, but the insurgency has since spread with frequent suicide bomb attacks.Africa's second-largest oil producer, Nigeria has made inroads in its military campaign to root out the Islamists, but at a high price for civilians. Last month, a Nigerian military jet accidentally bombed a camp for displaced people in Borno state, killing at least 112 civilians, including six Nigerian Red Cross workers, and wounding 100.Compounding the crisis, climate change and population growth have turned Lake Chad - once one of Africa's largest bodies of water - into an environmental disaster.The lake's water basin has shrunk to barely 10 per cent of its 1960s levels.The ambassadors will encourage the four countries to come up with a new strategy to address the crisis and its many facets, French Ambassador Francois Delattre said.Governments should "adopt a comprehensive approach to address the root causes of terrorism, including governance and development," he said.Sweden, a non-permanent council member and big humanitarian donor, hopes the council will be more active in tackling the crisis.The Lake Chad region has been hit by a "perfect storm" of challenges, Swedish diplomat Carl Skau said: "terrorism, trafficking, serious underdevelopment, but also the effects of climate change.""This cannot be a one-off," he added. "We need a serious follow-up when we come back."Fourteen countries pledged $672m to the Lake Chad funding appeal at a donors' conference in Oslo last week, a tally UN officials welcomed as a good start to the aid effort.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
