This has, however, fuelled suspicion that Kabila was trying to extend his term longer than what is constitutionally allowed.Masoka said Kabila had been trying to exercise power &ldquo;outside the constitutional framework&rdquo;. He said the mandates of senators and members of the National Assembly have expired, so in order to keep their power they have to keep from asking questions about Kabila&rsquo;s rule.Masoka also said the military and police had been used to violently suppress anti-government protests.&ldquo;The only chance to implement the (December) agreement is based on the people, churches and international community&rsquo;s support and the pressure on politicians to respect it,&rdquo; Masoka said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
