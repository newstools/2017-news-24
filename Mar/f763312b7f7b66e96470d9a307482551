The court upheld an appeal by the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency and The Mountainlands Owners Association. They appealed against a South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg order in favour of Barberton Mines (Pty) Ltd which sought to commence prospecting operations in an area that would include a part of the Barberton Nature Reserve. The questions in front of the court included whether or not the reserve was a protected area in terms of the National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act 57 of 2003. The court found that the reserve was, in fact, a protected area where mining operations are prohibited by law. The High Court order allowing the commencement of prospecting operations was set aside. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
