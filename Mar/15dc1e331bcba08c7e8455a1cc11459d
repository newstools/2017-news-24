Gordhan was summarily recalled from the UK&nbsp;leg of the trip on Monday. Zuma gave no official reasons.According to the report, Gordhan, Jonas and Treasury director general Lungisa Fuzile had set up "secret meetings" to start "operation Check Mate" and to tell investors they stood together against Zuma and the corruption of the Guptas.Zuma faces a rebellion within his own party should he fire Gordhan, with about 12 ministers considering resigning&nbsp;from their positions and then fighting for the president's removal if he goes ahead, according to four people familiar with the situation. Deputy President Ramaphosa and some deputy ministers may also resign, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the information isn't public. The officials would keep their seats in Parliament and possibly support or abstain from a vote of no confidence in the president if it is called by the opposition or by members of the ANC, said the sources. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
