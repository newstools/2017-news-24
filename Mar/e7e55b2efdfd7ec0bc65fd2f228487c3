This was the first of several payments totalling R80m that Mashaba said he made to George Sabelo, the ANC-linked lawyer, and Maria da Cruz Gomes, an Angolan citizen who calls herself a friend of President Jacob Zuma.The details are contained in Mashaba&rsquo;s latest court filings in Prasa&rsquo;s court bid to have the contract with Swifambo set aside.Mashaba denies that the payments he made to Sabelo and Gomes were linked to the Prasa contract. ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe denied that the organisation received the money.In his affidavit, Montana said: &ldquo;The applicant is using this court as a podium to insult, tarnish and defame my good name. This is a blatant disregard for the law and constitutes an abuse of process.The Prasa board asked the Johannesburg High Court to review and cancel a R3.5bn contract awarded to Swifambo in March 2013 to supply the company with locomotives made by Vossloh Espa&ntilde;a.Prasa instituted civil claims against Swifambo for R2.6 billion, however, the firm has since declared bankruptcy.Swifambo won a R3.5bn contract in 2012 to provide 70 new locomotives, which it bought from Vossloh Espa&ntilde;a. It was then revealed that the Afro 4000 locomotives were too tall for South Africa&rsquo;s rail network.Then public protector Thuli Madonsela released a report, titled Derailed, which found evidence of widespread maladministration and impropriety in the awarding of tenders worth R2.8bn.&ldquo;In his founding affidavit, Mr Molefe attacks my personal integrity and advances numerous false allegations against me,&rdquo; Montana said in his affidavit. &ldquo;Key among these is that the locomotive tender was rigged in favour of Swifambo and that I was the central person behind such unlawful conduct. "Mr Molefe further alleges that I, in my capacity as CEO of Prasa, did not have the authority to enter into a contract with Swifambo.&rdquo;Montana explained that the board of Prasa in July 2012 approved Swifambo&rsquo;s tender after the recommendation of its finance, capital investment and procurement committee.He said the board authorised him, &ldquo;in my capacity as the CEO, to finalise the Swifambo contract&rdquo;.&ldquo;As a direct result of board approval, Prasa and Swifambo entered into a sale-and-purchase agreement, which Prasa is irrationally seeking the court to declare as unlawful, and an order setting aside the contract with Swifambo,&rdquo; said Montana.&ldquo;Instead, Prasa is attempting to use other tricks, including scurrilous claims that the bid was rigged by me in favour of Swifambo, as a justification to cancel the contract with Swifambo. &ldquo;But a careful look at the reasons advanced by Prasa proves that these are simply false, invalid and totally irrational.&rdquo;Montana further claims that he has been the subject of an unlawful intelligence operation that is violating his rights. He alleges that Prasa has been working with a number of companies and individuals in conducting an unlawful investigation against him.&ldquo;Since July 2015, I have been subjected to this intensive campaign by a gang of criminals who had arrogated to themselves key functions of the state.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
