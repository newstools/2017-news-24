All we can do is pray that no shelling hits the house," she said."People are holed up indoors. Schools are closed."'Complex' tiesSince Kadhafi's fall, several armed groups have battled for control of the capital in the absence of a regular army or police force.The GNA has denied having any connection to the takeover of Ras Lanuf and Al-Sidra earlier this month.A Libya expert, in a briefing released last week, described the relationship between the GNA - and the Presidential Council (PC) that heads it - and the BDB that led the attack on the oil terminals as "complex and somewhat unclear"."While the GNA's Minister of Defence, Mahdi al-Barghati, supports the group, as do some members of the PC, the PC has officially condemned the attack and stated it had no ties to the BDB," Claudia Gazzini of the International Crisis Group think-tank said.The BDB were formed in 2016 by fighters including Islamists ousted from Benghazi by Haftar's forces.The GNA said last week that it had ordered oil installation guards who are loyal to it to secure the two terminals.Last month, Haftar and GNA head Fayez al-Sarraj agreed to form a committee to explore amending the UN-backed agreement that gave rise to the unity government.But the pro-Haftar eastern parliament, which was elected in 2014, last week suspended its participation in political dialogue and called for presidential and legislative elections to be held before next February.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
