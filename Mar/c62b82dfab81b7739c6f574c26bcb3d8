"A message was sent to me. It said there are people following me for investigating the case," Captain Amos Maneta said during his cross-examination in the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg. Maneta was the court's witness in the matter. "After obtaining statements, there was a lot of scary stories that those investigating the case would be killed. I saw in the media that prosecutors dealing with the case [were] being guarded," Maneta said. Mdluli was appearing on charges relating to the 1999 kidnapping of the late Oupa Ramogibe‚ who allegedly had an affair with Mdluli's former lover, Tshidi Buthelezi. Mdluli and his co-accused Mthembeni Mthunzi face charges of intimidation, kidnapping, assault with the intent to commit grievous bodily harm and defeating the ends of justice. They pleaded not guilty. 'The witness was lying' Maneta said he investigated the case until he was told that a team from Cape Town would take over. Maneta, who had taken a statement from Buthelezi's friend Alice Manana, laughed off court testimony by Manana that she had not seen Mdluli after she was shot. Maneta said, while taking Manana's statement, she informed him that she had been shot when she opened her door and that she had seen Mdluli sitting in his vehicle during the incident. However, during her testimony in court, Manana said she didn't mention that she saw Mdluli. "The witness was lying to the court when she mentioned that she didn't know what was in the paragraph [which was read in court]." Manana also added in her statement that she was taken to a police station, where she was assaulted. The assault lasted for about 30 to 35 minutes. Secret marriage Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng asked if Maneta knew about a project called "Ulibambe Lingashoni" which Mdluli previously said was created to "falsely incriminate him and pull him down". Maneta said he had read about it in the media. He denied allegations that he and his co-accused had assaulted Manana. During his testimony, he said some officers were instructed to "dig [for] any dirt" on him. The charges against Mdluli and his co-accused stem from the alleged extreme lengths Mdluli went to between 1997 and 1999 to find out where Buthelezi and Ramogibe were hiding. During her relationship with Mdluli, Buthelezi met Ramogibe and they began a relationship. They married "secretly" on July 22, 1998. Ramogibe allegedly received death threats after marrying Buthelezi and was told to leave her or he would be killed. He opened an attempted murder case before his death, but was eventually killed. The case continues on Tuesday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
