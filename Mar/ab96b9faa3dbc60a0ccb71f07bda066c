They would remain in custody.The State was still deciding exactly what charges the accused would face.Mbokazi&rsquo;s lawyer Andile Dakela told reporters outside the court that his client had been in a relationship with Mbambo and that they had a child.Three people arrested"My client says there was a threat to the life of the child, which prompted him to react swiftly. We have to postpone the matter for the DNA test to deal with the matter of kidnapping."Dakela said if it was found that Mbokazi was the father, the charge would fall away. He said he did not feel Mbokazi could be accused of hijacking."The charge of hijacking will fall away because the lady voluntarily handed the child over to my client. From where I stand there is nothing further than this logical explanation."The baby was found alive early on Sunday morning. She was taken in what appeared to have been a hijacking near Game City centre on Friday.A massive search was conducted and a reward of R250 000 offered for any information that would lead to her safe return.Police spokesperson Brigadier Sally de Beer said three people were arrested in the early hours of Sunday morning.The third person was not in court on Monday.&nbsp; The moment Sibongile Mbambo appeared at Durban Magistrate's court.
