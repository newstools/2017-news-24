Grim footage of what appear to be human remains being recovered from the crocodile has been posted to YouTube by online news outlet Bulawayo24. The footage, which News24 has seen, shows men slitting open the crocodile and retrieving human parts from its belly. These are then placed on a grey blanket next to the dead animal.

Bulawayo24 reporter Simbarashe Sithole said that the incident happened on Monday in Mushumbi, Mashonaland Central. "The crocodile was shot on Tuesday and was then cut open. The boy's remains were found in the beast's stomach." "A source told Bulawayo24.com that the young boy's remains were buried on Wednesday," Sithole wrote. There were no more details on the tragedy, which has not yet been confirmed by the authorities. Rains have recently been pounding Zimbabwe, causing flooding in the south of the country and rising river and dam levels elsewhere. This can mean that they shift location to places where they are not normally seen. Earlier this month a crocodile shot dead by rangers in Beatrice was found with what were presumed to be the remains of a fishermen inside its stomach. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
