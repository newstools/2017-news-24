Mantashe said the man who claims to be an ANC fundraiser must show proof that the money ended up at Luthuli House."The man who says he collected it (the money) for us, maybe he has the money. It can't be our money if it never arrived at the ANC," Mantashe said.Mantashe said the party had said the same, when News24 first reported the story."News24, you are repeating the story again, but there is no R80m. We made the point then that we never got the money. It is not the ANC that is in court," he said.News24 reported earlier that the chronology of the events around Swifambo&rsquo;s first payment from Prasa, and Mashaba&rsquo;s subsequent payments to Sabelo and Gomes, casts doubt over Mashaba&rsquo;s claims.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
