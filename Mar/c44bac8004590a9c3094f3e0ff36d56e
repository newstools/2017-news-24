It suspended the order of invalidity until March 31 this year to allow the department and the SA Social Security Agency to insource the administrative requirements to distribute grants.Nationally about 17 million beneficiaries are in limbo.According to its memorandum, the trade union federation was demanding that urgent steps be put in place by the Presidency to ensure that payments take place on April 1; that CPS be investigated for corruption; and that any links between CPS and politicians be revealed.'You have failed'Signed by provincial secretary Tony Ehrenreich, the union slammed social development minister Bathabile Dlamini, saying she had four years to deal with the matter.&ldquo;You have failed to inspire confidence in the people dependent on grants, thus creating great social instability that may lead to unrest. You have failed to prioritise the needs of our most desperate members of society&hellip;,&rdquo; the memorandum reads.Cosatu called for her resignation due to Dlamini&rsquo;s &ldquo;failure to lead this department&rdquo;, calling on President Jacob Zuma to remove her from office should she refuse to resign.&ldquo;We do not make this call easily, but we must put the best interest of our people first. We must ensure that the social compact that exist in the society, where the wealthy can continue to live excessive lives, but a basic income will be provided to overcome the legacy of apartheid until the economy creates jobs needed so out people can provide their own income.&rdquo;They gave Dlamini a deadline of March 21.&ldquo;This social security is the most important assistance tht poorer communities get from the State. This is a direct result of the decisions of the ANC policy conference to assist our people to overcome the legacy of apartheid&ldquo;To have an ANC deployed minister undermine the provision of social security is completely unacceptable. So many of our communities depend on this social rant to ensure that the threat of starvation is kept away from the door.&rdquo; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
