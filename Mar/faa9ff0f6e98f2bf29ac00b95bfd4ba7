South African authorities have declined to confirm the figure which may have been the result of other criminal activity, not just anti-immigrant violence.A protest march against "migrant crime" was held in Pretoria on February 24 and resulted in violent clashes between crowds of young South African men and migrants from elsewhere in Africa, including Nigerians and Somalis. President Jacob Zuma responded by condemning the wave of xenophobic unrest and called for calm and restraint, saying that migrants should not be used as a scapegoat for the country's widespread crime problem.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
