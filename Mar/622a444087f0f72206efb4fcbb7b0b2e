In fact, it is corruption and bad policy that have been the greatest inhibitors to land redistribution and reform," Maimane said. Corruption and bad policy were the greatest inhibitors to land redistribution and reform, and not the Constitution, the DA leader said on Friday.&nbsp; Zuma should have addressed the issue of land ownership in rural areas that fell under the jurisdiction of traditional leaders, Maimane said.&nbsp; "But President Zuma is not interested in policies that help the people of South Africa. His only focus is on whipping up divisive emotions," he said.&nbsp; Zuma on Friday called for "black political parties" to unite in dealing with the land issue. The time for talking and analysing had passed, he said, and called for action within the law. "The fact remains that land hunger is real. This is not surprising as this was the fundamental question at the centre of the liberation struggle." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
