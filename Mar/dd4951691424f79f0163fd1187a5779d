Six people were killed on the ground.The long-running investigation involved officials from the airline, engine manufacturers Pratt &amp; Whitney and international aviation experts."Everybody is satisfied with the final report and those found wanting have made necessary adjustments," said Olateru.Nigerian aviation authorities suspended Dana's operating licence on June 5, 2012, two days after the crash.But it was briefly allowed to resume operation in January 2013 after meeting some safety standards but did not start full operations until the following January. Dana Air was among the most popular carriers in Nigeria before the accident, with heavy traffic on its Abuja-Lagos route. AIB commissioner Akin Olateru told reporters the agency, which released a preliminary report on the crash in September 2012, spent so long on the investigation because of cash shortages.He said the agency needed more funding, as the $50 000 allocated in 2017 was not enough.Nigeria's worst air accident was in 1973, when 176 people died in a crash involving a Nigeria Airways Boeing 707 flying from Jeddah to Kano, according to the Aviation Safety Network website. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
