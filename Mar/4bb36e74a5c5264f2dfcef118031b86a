fourth foreign trip in 19 days, this time to Mauritius, according to a report
on state ZBC radio. Mugabe's frequent foreign trips during a time of economic
difficulty in Zimbabwe have provoked criticism back home. Since March 1, the 93-year-old has visited Singapore, Ghana,
Swaziland and now Mauritius. Said ZBC on its website on Sunday: "President Robert
Mugabe has arrived in Port Louis, Mauritius to join other heads of state and
government, captains of industry and intellectuals for the inaugural African
Economic Platform (AEP)." "President Mugabe was warmly welcomed at Ramgulan
International Airport by the Prime Minister of Mauritius, Mr Provin Jugnauth,
several ministers from the government of Mauritius, and representatives from
the African Union (AU)," the report said. "The flying president," commented Zimbabwe law
lecturer @Wamagaisa on Twitter. Mugabe has previously been nicknamed Zimbabwe's 'visiting
president' by critics. His spokesperson recently defended his foreign trips,
arguing that "diplomacy costs". See reaction on Twitter below. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
