The university said there was no damage to property or injuries reported but the institution gates remain locked."Today there was no academic programme taking place in the campus, staff and students could not access the facilities due to protesters," said university spokesperson Takalani Dzaga.He said the management will be seeking a meeting with the students to resolve the problems."There is commitment from NFSAS to start dispersing meal grants, and we had hope that will assist but we are unable to engage student leaders," said Dzaga.He said it was doubtful if lessons will continue on Tuesday as students' leaders were not immediately available to discuss issues with management.Dzaga confirmed that students have not received meal grant since the start of the academic year.However, he said NFSAS had promised to start distribute funds today. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
