Every one of us was in a jubilant mood," the pastor said."I couldn't sleep that night, we were all praying for what God has done for us."Ethical dilemmaMomoh took the diamond the next day to be weighed by the kind of Lebanese dealer who once purchased the single-carat gems he sold to buy food, supplies and to pay his workers' wages.At 706 carats, an amount that would later rise to 709 when it was placed on the government's official scales, Momoh's diamond was between the 10th and 15th largest ever found worldwide, experts told AFP.Such a find by a so-called artisanal miner, the term for workers who use basic tools or their bare hands to sift the earth, is exceedingly rare, and Momoh faced an ethical dilemma."I was tempted by many close friends who told me to smuggle the diamond to neighbouring Guinea Conakry," he said, thereby avoiding paying any tax on the diamond.Diamond smuggling has harrowing associations for many in Sierra Leone.Cross-border diamond trafficking fuelled the country's civil war of 1991-2002, when rebels allowed traders to exploit diamond mines and ship the gems abroad, largely via Liberia.These became known as "blood diamonds", since most of the labour was done by enslaved members of the population, who were killed or maimed if they refused.Momoh thought of his workers and the degradation mining had wreaked on their bodies.The hard physical labour usually caused hernias and exhaustion, he said, while injuries are also common during digging in pits and washing the dirt.When a pit suddenly collapses in the unregulated informal mines of Sierra Leone, deaths are common, he said, though nobody has died at any of the sites he mines.Most of the diggers are also vulnerable to malaria and often contract parasites by drinking from polluted streams. Momoh paid their medical bills.He made a decision about the diamond."Being a man of God, I decided to hand it over to local authorities," Momoh said, a choice that caused a global sensation, and he was soon invited to Freetown to meet President Ernest Bai Koroma.Imminent sale&nbsp;As a self-employed miner with a valid government permit, Momoh is entitled to the proceeds of the sale due on April 5 in Freetown, apart from the four percent the government legally takes for valuation and export, plus an undetermined level of income tax.Momoh has emphasised that his workers will also benefit from what could be an astronomical sum of money.Without a professional assessment of the diamond's potential flaws and colouring, it is impossible to value the stone.However, a polished stone cut from the Jonker, which is the 10th largest gem-diamond ever recovered at 726 carats, will go on sale in Hong Kong in May.A single 25-carat portion of that stone is likely to sell for $2.2 million to $3.6 million or $88 000 to $144 000 for a single carat, according to one expert consulted by AFP.Momoh is clear where the money will go: straight back to Kono, where he was born, to develop his mining business, support his wife and three children, and to the local community where so many live in desperate circumstances."The people dealing with the diamond," he said, "I hope they are as honest with me as I have been with them."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
