Therefore, this shows that if we can follow our own protocols and uphold rules of good governance Africa can go very far. Ecowas does have some sort of mechanism in place, but these also need to be enhanced," said&nbsp;Hounkpe.&nbsp;Meaningful impact&nbsp;He said that opposition parties were stronger when they were united in fighting those who were reluctant in allowing democratic processes."When opposition political actors come together, they can make a change. Without the political parties coming together in The Gambia, I do not think they could have been able to make a meaningful impact in getting Jammeh out. "However, now it is very important for them to stick together in government to pass their final hurdle in building democratic institution after a long time of a one man show.&nbsp;"It remains important to see how long the united Gambian opposition parties are going to stick together."If the opposition coalition in the country sticks together I am sure president Barrow would deliver successfully on his promise, but, if they have problems, it would be difficult to predict how Barrow's government is going to function," said Hounkpe.&nbsp;Since effectively taking power late in January, Barrow has tried to uphold pledges to overhaul 'government institutions' by&nbsp;assembling &nbsp;a team of allies in forming&nbsp;a government. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
