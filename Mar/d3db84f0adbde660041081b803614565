Le Pen met Putin hours after a previously announced visit to the lower house of the Russian parliament. In the meeting with members of the Duma, Le Pen urged Russia and France to work together to save the world from globalism and Islamic fundamentalism. Such positions put her in parallel with Kremlin stances and there has been wide speculation that Russia aims to influence the upcoming French election. But Putin dismissed those claims. "We in no way want to influence events, but retain for ourselves the right to meet all representatives of all political powers, just as our partners in Europe and the US do," he said. Le Pen has made multiple trips to Russia and often met Russian lawmakers. Moscow has courted far-right parties in Europe in an influence-building campaign amid friction between Russia and the West over the conflict in Ukraine and the war in Syria. France's two-round presidential election takes place on April 23 and May 7. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
