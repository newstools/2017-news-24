	     Dead Sea - Sudan's official news agency says President Omar al-Bashir will attend Wednesday's Arab Summit in Jordan, despite a long-standing warrant for his arrest by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and genocide. The international group Human Rights Watch urged Jordan to deny entry to Bashir or arrest him, citing its obligations as an ICC member. Jordan says that as an Arab League member, Sudan has the right to attend the annual meeting of Arab leaders. Bashir was charged in connection with alleged atrocities in the country's Darfur region. The UN estimates 300 000 people have died there and 2.7 million have fled their homes. Sudan's news agency SUNA reported Sunday that he would attend the summit. He has traveled frequently since his indictment but is careful where he goes. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
