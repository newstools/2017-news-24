Moyo is part of the G40, which is rivalled by a faction led by Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa. This faction is nicknamed Lacoste.Crucially, Lacoste has control over the state Zimpapers stable. It's "using" this to attack Moyo, who has the sympathies of some Zimbabweans on social media not least because of his unusual willingness to engage.So angry was Moyo this week that he threatened to report Zimpapers to Google and Twitter for "routinely reporting fake news". In his statement he said ruling party officials who'd attacked him in the state newspapers were "command liars".It's a far cry from the heady (at least for Moyo) days of 2000 to 2005 when as information minister he crafted AIPPA and controlled the anti-opposition, anti-Western message so evident in the pages of the Herald and the Sunday Mail.As one Twitter user commented this week: "He will be victimised &amp; vilified until the succession [question] is settled."Remembering his past, not every Zimbabwe is sympathetic to Moyo now."Lest we 4get.&nbsp;Jonso&nbsp;started [the] evil eating him," tweeted @mmatigari.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
