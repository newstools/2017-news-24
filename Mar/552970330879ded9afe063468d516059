Washington's annual $1.3bn in military aid was fully reinstated in 2015.In January Trump pledged in a phone conversation with Sisi that the United States remained committed to bilateral ties with Egypt."The president committed to continuing military assistance to Egypt and working with Egypt to ensure that assistance most effectively supports the Egyptian military's fight against terrorism," White House spokesperson Sean Spicer said at the time.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
