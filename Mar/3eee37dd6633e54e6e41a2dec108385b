Malema submitted papers on Thursday asking the court to force Parliament to fulfil its constitutional duty to take action against President Jacob Zuma. Malema delivered an application to the court for it to order the Speaker of Parliament to institute impeachment proceedings against Zuma. The EFF's application cites the president's conduct with regard to the Nkandla scandal and Zuma's "lying to Parliament on numerous occasions". Zuma unduly benefited from security upgrades to his home but refused to pay for non-security upgrades as per the former Public Protector Advocate Thuli Madonsela's binding recommendations on the matter. "If the Constitutional Court can supervise a parastatal like Sassa [the South African Social Security Agency] then it can supervise Parliament," Malema said outside the Constitutional Court. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
