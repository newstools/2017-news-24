TUT is working closely with the SAPS in investigating the matter.&rdquo;Pretora West SAPS said several cases were opened over the weekend about separate incidents on campus. They could not confirm that specific case because their systems had been down since Sunday. &nbsp;The accused was expelled from TUT in 2010 after interrupting Mbeki&rsquo;s speech on Africa: War and Peace. In the video, the accused storms into the Theunis Bester Hall, where the lecture took place, shouting &ldquo;sihamba no Zuma&rdquo; (we are going with Zuma). &nbsp;A case of assault was opened, but the National Prosecuting Authority later withdrew it.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
