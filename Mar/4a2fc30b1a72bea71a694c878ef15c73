From my observation while standing in front of him, he wanted to proceed further and [was swerving from left to right]."I stood in front of them and said: 'This is not allowed in this office.'"He said Mohamed then walked over and shook Seale, who got up and left.Seale laid a charge of assault against Jacobs, claiming he was punched off a chair before being kicked repeatedly while lying on the ground.At the start of the trial Seale testified that Jacobs kept on shouting: "Jy vat my lankal vir 'n naai [You've treated me like a fool for long enough]" after he told Jacobs he hadn't had time to write a report and that he was merely helping him as it wasn't in his job description.Jacobs apparently closed the door and came up behind Seale and hit him against the temple with his fist, causing Seale to fall off the chair.Seale alleged that Jacobs kept repeating the profanity while kicking him in the abdomen and face "between five and ten times".ScreamingHe said he had not retaliated and had instead shouted for help.But according to Jacobs' version of events, a heated exchange took place between him and Seale. He claimed the policy co-ordinator prodded him in the chest.In his plea explanation, Jacobs said he had then used his right hand to slap Seale away from him, connecting with the left side of his face.He also raised his leg to "ward off" Seale at the same time.He could not say if his leg had made contact with Seale as the slap had caused him to apparently fall down against the office safe.Mohamed told the court she had heard Seale screaming: "He's hitting me, he's hitting me, help", before she and a colleague rushed to Jacobs' office.Cause of injuries disputedShe said prior to that, she had not heard any altercations or raised voices.Seale has previously told the court he had required seven stitches to his left ear and had suffered some bruising to his neck and arm.But during closing arguments defence lawyer William King argued that Seale's injuries according to his medical report were not consistent with what he claimed had happened."He said he was repeatedly kicked in the torso and face, yet none of his injuries on his J88 [medical report] can be attributed to these kicks," he said.The ANC's national disciplinary committee found Jacobs guilty of assault in April 2016, following an altercation with the former ANC employee at the party's provincial offices in November 2015.Jacobs had his party membership suspended for 18 months. The sanction, however, was suspended for three years.The case was postponed to April 11. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
