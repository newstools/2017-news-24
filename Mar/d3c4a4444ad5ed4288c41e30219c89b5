The movement comprises current and past activists and ANC members.Maine accused Gordhan of being an "impimpi" for white monopoly capital. He told ANCYL delegates at the league's provincial elective conference in Durban at the weekend how "izimpimpi" were dealt with during the anti-apartheid struggle.Maine questioned who Gordhan was representing. Pre-1994, those labelled izimpimpi were necklaced for their betrayal to the struggle. This method of execution involved putting a petrol-soaked car tyre over someone's head and setting it alight.ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa earlier this week said Maine's statement was "reckless and regrettable"."We think there is everything wrong with that statement politically. The ANC at some point will talk to him and get clarity."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
