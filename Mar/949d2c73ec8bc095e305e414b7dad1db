In many cases that will mean that where traffic police once demanded $20 for a traffic offence, they can now demand $30. Four fines of this level grouped together (not unheard of in Harare) will now come to $120.That's on the spot.&nbsp;And sadly, there are normally no swipe machines in sight.The Facebook group Dear ZRP, which has managed to amass nearly 30 000 members, carries stories of frustrated drivers fined for obscure offences like "dirty exhausts" or "splayed springs".It's widely believed that police have set targets of money they have to raise. &nbsp;Commented one Chronicle reader at news of the increased fines late on Wednesday: "Bribes shall prevail."In February a cop caught demanding a bribe from a driver whose car had been impounded at a roadblock tried to swallow the money. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
