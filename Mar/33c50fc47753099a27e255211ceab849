The second year would focus on rolling out a new plan.She also said they apologised to the Constitutional Court for the "unstable reports" surrounding their readiness to take over the scheme.The department's technical task team, which includes a state law advisor, is currently reviewing the terms of the new contract, and will report back on Friday.Thereafter, the department will make a public announcement on the new deal with CPS.She could not comment on whether Treasury would support the new contract, as required by the Public Finance Management Act, and said Treasury must speak for itself.* This article has been updated.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
