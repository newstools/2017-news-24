"In response to this, we will assign senior officials of the department to meet with the protesting community to hear their reasons for the protest," Gasela said. "The policy that regulates allocation of houses and human settlements units to communities only allocates these to South African citizens and not foreign nationals."She said residents should let the department know if beneficiaries are selling their houses to foreign nationals."We know that some beneficiaries do this. Where our people have knowledge of corruption, they must give us evidence so that we deal with the issue," Gasela said. "The department is committed to resolve issues related to corruption around allocation of houses. Where there has been evidence of wrongdoing, we have dealt with the issues. "Our laws mandate us to allocate houses to South African citizens and not foreign nationals."#ReigerPark residents have turned up in their numbers outside the Ekurhuleni Municipality. @News24 pic.twitter.com/NYqBFg1wan&mdash; Iavan Pijoos (@Iavan13) March 9, 2017#ReigerPark residents have turned up in their numbers outside the Ekurhuleni Municipality. @News24 pic.twitter.com/NYqBFg1wan#ReigerPark residents shouting at EMPD, "Die plek gaan brand.
