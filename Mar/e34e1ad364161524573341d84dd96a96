Heilie CombrinckThe Swartkops River surely is one of the most polluted rivers in Nelson Mandela Bay and some residents living in its catchment area, north of Uitenhage, do not play their part when it comes to illegal dumping.In a joint venture between the Department of Roads and Stormwater which falls under the Infrastructure and Engineering Directorate of the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality together together with Waste Management and a service provider Fine Corp, parts of the river at Nivens Bridge were cleaned up.Experiencing a birds eye view flying over the river, it is evident that the condition of the river dramatically worsens at the Cat Canal inflow close to the Nivens Bridge. Here all kinds of household items as well as refrigerator and washing machine parts can be seen floating in the water. Residents are urged to stop illegal dumping into the Cat Canal. It has a disastrous effect not only on the river and its inhabitants, but also the unique Swartkops estuary and eventually the sea.
