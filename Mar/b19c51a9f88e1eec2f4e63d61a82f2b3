 AT a Sukuma Sakhe meeting recently, community members of Bashaweni and KwaMbotho areas in Harding complained about the poor state of schools, the vandalism of schools, drug abuse, crime and poverty. Inkosi Buyiswa Zungu from the Zungu Tribal Authority in the area asked government to assist communities to fight crime. She said their communities are subjected to drug abuse, which leads to crime and other social ills. “We have a high crime rate in the area. Three schools were burgled and several computers were stolen.” Other people complained about the lack of basic services like water, houses and scholar transport for pupils.    Ward 2 resident Petros Khalala said there are limited job opportunities for disabled people and asked government to create more jobs and teach them skills. Judy Magwaza, the deputy head from Department of Education said the department will attend to the challenges raised. “All issues raised by people will be addressed and reported back to them.” - Supplied
