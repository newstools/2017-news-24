There were instances where the police clobbered defenceless Nigerians to death on suspicion of being involved in criminality."The lawmakers reportedly accused the Nigerian government of not "doing enough" to protect Nigerians in the southern African country.The chairperson of the committee on foreign affairs, Senator Monsurat Sunmonu, said it was time for Nigeria to impose sanctions on South Africa, adding that Nigeria should also consider retaliatory moves against the southern African country.Sunmonu's remarks came just a week after Nigerians staged an anti-xenophobia protest outside the South African embassy in Abuja, calling on authorities to "stop attacks on African nationals".The protest, organised by members of the National Youth Council of Nigeria, urged the South African government to urgently address the situation.The protesters carried placards such as "South Africa we say stop killing our people" and chanted slogans denouncing the attacks. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
