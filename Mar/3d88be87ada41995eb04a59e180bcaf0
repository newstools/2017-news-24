Around him, fellow dignitaries wore suits. ZBC said Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth also "observed the dress code" during his opening remarks.State TV said Mugabe was "well-dressed" in its main evening news bulletin.Mugabe's spokesperson George Charamba told ZBC: "The trouble is that we are so schooled in British dress etiquette that any departure from it amounts to scruffiness."AU Foundation speaks on Pres Mugabe dress code: https://t.co/qt3autG1Kv pic.twitter.com/LaAI8Ka9KEPresident Mugabe back from successful AEP Summit : https://t.co/o9SMxQK3lx pic.twitter.com/Yl04EWSQcg24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
