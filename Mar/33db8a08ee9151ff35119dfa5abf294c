Resources have been sent to ensure that the routes are re-opened and so that traffic can flow again."He said most of the trucks have already moved, and that efforts were being made to re-open the N4 and N1.It was not immediately clear what the truckers' demands are.Pretoria - N1 North: #ProtestAction RT @JustinKennerley @TrafficSA N1N after Rigel has been closed by what appears to be truck drivers. pic.twitter.com/2f92RTXhCX&mdash; Rob Byrne (@TrafficSA) March 1, 2017Pretoria - N1 North: #ProtestAction RT @JustinKennerley @TrafficSA N1N after Rigel has been closed by what appears to be truck drivers. pic.twitter.com/2f92RTXhCX24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
