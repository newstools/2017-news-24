Mpho Raborife; News 24 Johannesburg - Grants agency Sassa has filed court papers to the Constitutional Court.&nbsp;Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng's spokesperson Nathi Mncube confirmed to News24 that an electronic copy of their submissions was filed on Monday afternoon.The papers were heads of argument and not a direct response to questions by the Constitutional Court.&nbsp;The court had sent Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini and Sassa a number of stern questions to answer, including when Dlamini had known that the agency would not meet the April 1 deadline to take over the payments of grants to 17 million beneficiaries.&nbsp;Sassa is in a scramble to ensure that grants are paid on April 1 when its contract with CPS, which was previously declared unlawful by the Constitutional Court, expires.&nbsp;*This story has been corrected to reflect that the papers filed were not a direct response to questions by the Constitutional Court on March 8. The initial story was written off confirmation by the office of Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng&nbsp;that papers had indeed been filed to the court by the deadline.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
