They submitted papers before 16:00," Mncube said.&nbsp;The court had sent Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini and Sassa a number of stern questions to answer, including when Dlamini had known that the agency would not meet the April 1 deadline to take over the payments of grants to 17 million beneficiaries.&nbsp;Sassa is in a scramble to ensure that grants are paid on April 1 when its contract with CPS, which was previously declared unlawful by the Constitutional Court, expires.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
