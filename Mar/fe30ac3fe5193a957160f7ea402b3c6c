SOME twenty-one taxis were impounded and more than R100 000 s worth of fines were issued when Kouga Municipality and the South African Police Service held roving road blocks in and around Jeffreys Bay on Friday, March 16. Kouga Executive Mayor Elza van Lingen said the aim of the joint operation was to clamp down on illegal taxi operators in the municipal area. Public transport vehicles were targeted so as to ensure that they were roadworthy and licensed to operate in Kouga. We wanted to send out a clear message that illegal taxi operators would not be tolerated, the Mayor said. We would like to thank the police for joining us in this anti-crime operation. Our goal is to have regular road blocks so as to rid Kouga of illegal taxis and prevent the conflict which tends to go hand-in-hand with this. The Humansdorp Taxi Association, affi-liated to the Border Alliance Taxi Association, is currently the only association with a valid permit to transport commuters internally in Kouga.She said 25 fines, totalling R106 500, were issued to taxis operating without a valid permit and for vehicles and drivers who failed to comply with fitness requirements. Fines totalling R9 800 linked to 11 warrants of arrests, were also collected during Friday s operation while one arrest was made for reckless and negligent driving.Twenty-one taxis were impounded, of which 15 have thus far been released after the owners paid fines totalling R37 500. The taxis were impounded for either being un-roadworthy or for operating in the Kouga without a valid permit, the Mayor said. The successful operation demonstrates what can be achieved when we all work together. We will be working closely with Brigadier John le Bok and his police officers with the purpose of reducing crime in all our towns . 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
