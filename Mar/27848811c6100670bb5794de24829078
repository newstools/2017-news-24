We will make the announcement before the end of March," Nkonki said.On March 2, five people sustained minor injuries after the roof collapsed near the facility's main entrance.The incident took place while private construction workers were repairing a leaking section of the roof.Mamabolo blamed the collapse on shoddy workmanship by the contractors. He said the contractor had removed concrete stones and placed them on a thin roof that could not handle the weight, resulting in the roof's collapse.&nbsp;The contractor needed to be held accountable for the manner in which the workers had approached the job, Mamabolo said at the time.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
