The Constitution grants the president, and the president alone, the powers to appoint the Cabinet," Nzuza said.Their confidence in Zuma's leadership had been restored, he said."While we may not always fully agree with what often seems to be his over-consultations, which are often betrayed through media briefings, and his willingness to compromise, we appreciate his attempt to achieve unity within the movement."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
