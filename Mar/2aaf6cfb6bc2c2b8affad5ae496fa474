Thanking Treasury for their presence. #SASSAGodi says defence of CPS contract still blows his mind, especially people who fought for freedom. Says it&#39;s totally contradictory. @News24Godi is wrapping up the session. Says Cabinet&#39;s intervention points to a &quot;crisis of confidence&quot; in DSD and Dlamini. #Sassa #Scopa @News24#Kekana: Treasury has assisted us in demystifying this whole thing coz the perception created was that treasury does not want to cooperate.Kekana says #Scopa should look at inviting the CEOs of #Sassa and the Post Office to also give testimony. @News24ANC MPs Booi and Kekana say they are happy with Treasury&#39;s input, and is now more confident over #Sassa crisis. #Scopa @News24ConCourt issues new directive to Sassa, Dlamini&nbsp;The Constitutional Court has issued a new directive to Sassa and Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini on why it missed the deadline to respond to questions by the court. &nbsp;The previous acting CEO of Sassa Thamo Mzobe, current acting CEO Wiseman Magasela and Dlamini were directed to file affidavits by 15:00 on Tuesday on why the directions by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng were not complied with, Mogoeng's spokeperson Nathi Mncube confirmed to News24. The court had sent Dlamini and the grants agency a set of stern questions on March 8. They were given a deadline of Monday 16:00 to make the submission.&nbsp;Godi taking last round of questions from MPs. #Sassa #Scopa @News24Brauteseth asks for clarity, if the work streams deviation was accepted or not. Tshitangano says no. #Scopa @News24Treasury official Solly Tshitangano says the work stream deviation has not been approved. They had 12 months to invite bids. #Scopa @News24Human says deviation was approved on grounds that continuity needed to be addressed and with conditions. #Sassa #Scopa @News24Human says Treasury was told that #Sassa would handle the grants scheme initially, and only received deviation in June. #Scopa @News24Treasury officials providing further clarity. #SCOPA #SASSATreasury procurement head Schalk Human now addressing some issues in govt contracts. #Scopa #Sassa @News24Treasury official says the meetings between #Sassa, DSD and Treasury have been &quot;rolling engagement all the time&quot;. #Scopa @News24Fuzile says there needs to be due process to &quot;disqualify&quot; banks from bidding process. &quot;It can&#39;t arbitrary.&quot; #Sassa #Scopa @News24Fuzile says that money deposited into the account of a grant recipient, then belongs to the estate of the recipient. #Scopa @News24Treasury DG #Fuzile: There aren&#39;t several meetings which we were invited to &amp; did not participate, it was only 1 &amp; that was re negotiations.Fuzile says the difference between R16.44 and R22 could be down to confusing the sum and average of CPI inflation. #Scopa @News24Fuzile: &quot;The money to pay is there. What does not exist [yet] is a contract.&quot; He wants to clarify it&#39;s not a crisis of money. #Scopa @News24Fuzile says if the emergency 12-month figure of R2.3bn is exhausted, there are other means to finance grants scheme. #Sassa #Scopa @News24Treasury DG #Fuzile: There is money to pay the grants &amp; there is money to pay the person who pays the grant. Money is not the issue. #SCOPADDG of Treasury Lungisa Fuzile says there is money for the #Sassa grants scheme. It is earmarked for the service provider. #Scopa @News24Deputy finance minister Jonas says the new contract is being looked at. #Sassa #Scopa @News24Gordhan hands over to his deputy. #Sassa #Scopa @News24Gordhan: In closing, we should assure you that there's no crisis, that there's certainty, and that recipients will be paid in time.&nbsp;"We join you in sending a message to the shareholders of this company (CPS) that they should be more respectful. This is not just a money-making exercise."&nbsp;Gordhans says using slogans like &quot;green, black, red monopoly capital&quot;, or other transformation slogans cloud the issue. #Scopa @News24Gordhan says we can&#39;t use slogans to argue this issue. #Sassa #Scopa @News24#Gordhan: We might need to accept that special meassures need to be in place for the next few months to ensure grants are paid.#SCOPA #SASSAGordhan says CPS CEO Sergio Belamante is getting the message loud and clear from Parliament about his &quot;arrogance&quot;. #Sassa #Scopa @News24Gordhan says there&#39;s a contingency post-April1. Special measures will have to be put in place to ensure grants will be paid. #Scopa @News24Gordhan says Treasury would be equally concerned if the info and data about 17 million recipients is not in govt&#39;s hands. #Scopa @News24Gordhan says courts, judiciary &amp; admin &quot;will find a way&quot; to create the most transparent process in paying the #Sassa grants. #Scopa @News24#Gordhan: We shouldn&#39;t generate panic at all. All processes underway will ensure that grants are paid. #SCOPA #SASSA#Gordhan: On invitations to meetings, I don&#39;t attend those type of meetings. My colleagues can provide clarity on that. #SCOPA #SASSAGordhan says matter surrounding Dr Makhosi Khoza is a Parliament matter, &amp; should be taken up with ethics committee if they see fit. @News24&quot;Let&#39;s put that in the strange box,&quot; Gordhan says. #Scopa #Sassa @News24Gordhan says it is &quot;quite strange&quot; that the details of the new contract will only be available 20 days after. #Sassa #Scopa @News24Gordhan says it is responsibility of the DG involved with the new CPS contract to give Treasury approval. #Scopa @News24Gordhan says its up to officials in charge to decide which option going forward will best handle the #Sassa grants system long-term. @News24Gordhan reaffirms that procurement is the business of officials. &quot;If we respect that line, we get ourselves in less trouble.&quot; #Scopa @News24#Gordhan: SASSA is best placed to explain the R16 vs R22. It is a valid question. #SCOPA #SASSAGordhan says the Net1 contract is not &quot;child&#39;s play&quot;. It deals with 17 million people and gives Net1 R2bn from the govt. #Scopa @News24#Gordhan: On CPS &amp; it&#39;s behavior, I&#39;d send a message to shareholders of Net1 about the public utterances of their CEO. #SCOPA #SASSA Jump to top
