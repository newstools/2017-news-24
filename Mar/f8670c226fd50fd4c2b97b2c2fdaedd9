They managed to find an electrical point and had made arrangements for water."We've decided that no, we've had it," said the protester at the abandoned hospital, which is rented out as a film location.In a preface to their letter of demand, the occupiers said blacks and coloureds are still experiencing the forced evictions that their parents and grandparents went through during apartheid. This time it is driven by urban redevelopment.They are being moved out to make way for places they cannot afford and relocated to informal settlements in Blikkiesdorp, Wolwerivier and Marikana.Their demands are:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
