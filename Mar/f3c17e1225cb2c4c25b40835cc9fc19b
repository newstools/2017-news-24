The minister, Khaled el-Anani, told a news conference on Thursday that the colossus discovered last week in an eastern Cairo suburb almost certainly depicts Psamtek I, who ruled Egypt between 664 and 610 BC. El-Anani spoke in the front yard of the famed Egyptian museum in the heart of Cairo. Sitting just meters away from him were parts of the statue, including the torso and a partial head, which were ferried from the site to the museum early on Thursday. The statue was thought to be of Ramses II, who ruled Egypt more than 3 000 years ago. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
