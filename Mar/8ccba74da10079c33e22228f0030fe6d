The Fisheries Agency said on Friday that the five-ship fleet finished its four-month expedition. Japan says the hunt was for ecological research. Research whaling is allowed as an exception to a 1986 international ban on commercial whaling. Opponents of the Japanese programme say it's a cover for commercial whaling because the whales are sold. The International Court of Justice ruled in 2014 that Japan's Antarctic whaling program should stop because it wasn't scientific as Tokyo had claimed. Japan conducted non-lethal whaling research in the Antarctic in 2015, and revised its programme in 2016 by reducing the catch quota. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
