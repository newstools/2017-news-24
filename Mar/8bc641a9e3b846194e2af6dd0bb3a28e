Opposition MPs shouted back."When we do," he continued, "the minister will be prepared to come back here and address this matter and outline the steps that are being taken.""Where is she?" they shouted one last time.'Nothing suspicious' in review of mental health lawsRamaphosa also addressed the issue of the more than 100 mental health patients who died in Gauteng after being transferred from government-subsidised Life Esidimeni centres to various unlicensed NGOs in 2016.He said the final report of Health Ombudsman Malegapuru Makgoba concluded that there was prima facie evidence that certain officials and NGOs violated the Constitution and the Mental Health Care Act.He said there should be dialogue about mental health care being handled at national government level instead of provincially."When we negotiated this Constitution, many people were fearful that national government would become so powerful and so overbearing it would override interests at the local level."The truth is, many have seen how national government has tried to help all people."There is nothing suspicious that national government does to undermine any sphere of government in the country."Department 'hamstrung' by lawsHe said national government was being hamstrung by current laws in addressing the important issue of mental health on a national scale.There is nothing wrong with South Africans reflecting 22 years into democracy on examining the country's laws and asking if authority should be transferred to the national government and the minister on this issue, Ramaphosa said.He also defended government's overall record in healthcare, saying the life expectancy in South Africa has risen to 62 years of age as of 2016.It was "somewhere in the 50s" when the ANC government took over in 1994.The ANC government took over a fragmented healthcare system that abused people throughout the country, he said.He concluded by saying Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi is doing a good job under very difficult circumstances. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
