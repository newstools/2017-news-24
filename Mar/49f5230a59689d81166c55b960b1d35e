They say that Letsoalo identified serious and false allegations which sought to tarnish his reputation in the founding affidavit."Your client's failure to join our client as a respondent has been prejudicial to our client. As a result, our client has decided to make an application to court to be permitted to intervene in the application and to be joined as a respondent," Letsoalo's attorneys wrote.They added that he has been left with little time to file court papers and requested that the matter be postponed until next week.In a letter to Letsoalo's attorneys, the board cautioned that should he approach the court to join in as a respondent, he should not prevent the proceedings from being heard.The former board members warned Letsoalo that they would seek punitive costs against him in his personal capacity, and argued for a finding of contempt of court, should he request a delay.Molefe was seated in the front row during the short appearance in the packed courtroom.He filed an urgent application for the court to declare the board's dissolution unlawful, to reinstate the board members to their former positions, and to prevent an interim board from being appointed.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
