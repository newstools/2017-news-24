Strategic positions were filled and more appointments were expected," she told the committee.A skills audit had been conducted, and high-speed connectivity installed at 80% of the Public Protector offices.In her strategic report, she raised concerns about security at some of the Public Protector offices."[It] has become a major risk and several break-ins and muggings have been reported in provincial and regional offices.
