We get many children suffering from malnutrition."As an immediate measure all children up to 15 years old are given food at the border itself, he said."We put them through quick nutrition checks, then give them some food and ensure they're vaccinated, mainly against cholera."Behind Saeed, several refugees carrying bags on their heads or in donkey carts cross the border.Once through the checkpoint on the Sudanese side, their details are taken and they are given first aid if necessary."When we started we were scared and thought we wouldn't make it. But finally we're here," said Vivian Fiter, who travelled from the city of Malakal in Upper Nile state with her sister and their children, including a four-month-old baby.Not enough aid, fundingFiter had embarked on the risky journey to be with relatives she said live in a camp run by the United Nations in Sudan."Those not living in the UN camps are really suffering. They have no food or any other aid," she said.Aid workers at the border whisked her children off for a check-up and to get them vaccinated."When they arrive in such conditions we simply have to double our efforts," said Emad Abdurrahman, head of UNHCR's office in White Nile."Our problem is we don't have enough aid items or funding."The UNHCR and its partners have appealed for $166.65 million to meet the needs of South Sudanese refugees in Sudan this year, but so far have managed to raise just five percent of that target."We have to come up with a new plan. The number of refugees is simply increasing," Abdurrahman said.For many South Sudanese arriving at the border, they were actually returning to what was their home country before the split."I was shot in the leg one night in Juba," said Mour Mokor, who arrived at the border on Tuesday in a wheelchair and wanted to get to Khartoum."There is only misery there," he said of the South Sudanese capital."Now I want to join some family members in Sudan, where I used to live before the partition."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
