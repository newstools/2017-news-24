Plato denied the smear campaign allegations.Moses was the leader of a faction of the 28s gang called The Mobsters.Retaliation shootingsSources told News24 The Mobsters had carried out hits for 28s gang kingpin George "Geweld" Thomas who in 2015 was sentenced to seven life terms in jail.On January 15, 2016 two gunmen walked up to Moses, who was parked outside a car rental dealership in Main Road, Strand, and shot him at least six times in the head.The killing is believed to have sparked several retaliation shootings.No arrests were made for Moses' murder and police say it is still under investigation.Vearey told News24 that among the new "rumours" being peddled, which he said also emanated from Hendricks, was that he had planned the killing with an alleged gang boss."After the incident happened, I [according to the information being peddled] took the keys of the hired car [Moses was in] to a colonel," he said.No comment on action against rumoursVearey named a senior police officer as being the driving force in spreading the information.He said Hendricks has made similar allegations about him relating to the same issues before."This resulted in nothing," Vearey said.He was not yet prepared to comment on whether he would take action against the officers he believed were targeting him in the matter.In April 2016, the initial claims linking Vearey to crime, which he spoke out about and which appeared in the media, led to a meeting with Police Minister Nathi Nhleko and Acting National Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane.At the time Vearey and Plato, who Vearey accused or running a smear campaign to tarnish his reputation, agreed they would no longer discuss the matter in public.In May 2016, Vearey had been encouraged to lodge a complaint with Phahlane about Hendricks' claims implicating him in crime.Vearey said in June 2016 the investigation into this had been completed, but he was yet to receive a report into it."I find it problematic," he said.Whistleblower's gang linksNews24 understands the fresh allegations made against Vearey are being taken seriously by police and a policing head visited the source of the information in jail.In December 2016 Hendricks, who has links to the 26s and 28s gangs, was arrested for breaking her parole conditions.Hendricks, who earlier in 2016 told former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela that a Cape Town gangster had been paid R740 000 to have her killed, was previously sentenced to 12 years in jail for various crimes, including making a bomb threat to then Public Protector Lawrence Mushwana.She was arrested in December for failing to tell the Department of Correctional Services of a change in her address which led to department officials not being able to monitor her.National police and the regional department of correctional services are expected to respond to News24 queries later on Tuesday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
