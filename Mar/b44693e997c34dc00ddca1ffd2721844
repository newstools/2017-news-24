"It is creating an air of uncertainty for investors. The CBN is artificially funding the market to punish speculators and hoarders." Of particular concern was the use of foreign reserves to shore up the naira, he said."We are using up in six weeks what we ought to use for six months. This is not sustainable," he said, urging the CBN "to move towards a market-driven" forex market.That would give greater certainty for currently wary investors, he added.Precarious situation&nbsp;The director-general of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Muda Yusuf, said businesses had greeted the bank's move this week with "relief"."Gradually investors confidence is returning to the economy," he said. But he also expressed concern about whether the policy was sustainable."How far can the CBN go in making dollars readily available to industries and importers?"OPEC member Nigeria relies on crude oil sales for 90 percent of its foreign exchange earnings and 70 percent of government revenue, making it particularly vulnerable to global shocks.Crude prices have rallied internationally since the slump began in mid-2014, while militant attacks that hit production in Nigeria's oil-rich south have tailed off, Yusuf noted.But he said the situation was still precarious."The CBN should further liberalise the FX market to allow for other inflows of forex. If the current supply source dries up, we may be back to zero," he added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
