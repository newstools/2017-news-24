Their appeals were still pending with the country's Supreme Court when Barrow granted them amnesty last month.The six men have already begun work, the source added.The December 30, 2014 coup attempt saw a group of heavily armed men storm the presidential palace in Banjul before being repelled by forces loyal to Jammeh.Jammeh is now living in exile in Equatorial Guinea after losing a December election to Barrow. He refused to recognise the result of the historic polls until the threat of west African military intervention to remove him forced the mercurial leader from power.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
