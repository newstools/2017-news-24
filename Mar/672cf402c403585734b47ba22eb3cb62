Ntlemeza applied for leave to appeal against the judgment.In his ruling, Matojane found Ntlemeza had withheld information from the court and police watchdog, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate, which could have enabled the court to make a proper assessment. He found Ntlemeza lacked integrity and honesty.In his application for leave to appeal, Nhleko said Matojane erred in relying on the Sibiya judgment."The full court erred in relying on the remarks made in the Sibiya judgment since such remarks were made without the second respondent [Ntlemeza] having been afforded an opportunity to deal therewith." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
