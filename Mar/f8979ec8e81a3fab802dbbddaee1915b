One of them was American and the other Swedish-Chilean.The CENI "is a target, and this worries us", said its president, Corneille Nangaa.In a report published on Tuesday in Kinshasa, the Episcopal Commission for Justice and Peace (CJP) said the unrest "threatens to delay voter registration".The CJP called on Kinshasa to ensure "a calm atmosphere is maintained before, during and after the voter registration process". Under a power-sharing deal reached on New Year's Eve, DRC is set to hold an election by the end of 2017.But the UN has criticised a lack of progress towards implementing the deal, which also called for a transitional council to be established.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
