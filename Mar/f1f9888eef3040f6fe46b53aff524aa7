Walker said its technicians managed to restore power earlier on Sunday which enabled trains to operate in both directions sharing one line. "These illegal connections present a serious safety hazard and prevent Metrorail from completing repairs that will restore a full service for the week ahead. No further repairs can be done unless illegal connections are removed," he added. A meeting will be held with community leaders and other key stakeholders on Monday. Walker said he was confident that the engagement would yield positive results, allowing the completion of repairs and provide a service on Monday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
