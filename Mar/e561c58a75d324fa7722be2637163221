She said she was fed up and wanted to go to the police because [Mzuvukile] had raped her three times."He had not been home at the time of the neighbour's visit.Another person said Vuyiseka had told her to call the police because she had been raped, but the woman had told her to rather phone Mzuvukile's mother "so that she could decide the way forward because they were married and had three kids".Residents tried to intervene when Mzuvukile allegedly chased Vuyiseka as she escaped from her house to the home of a friend.She fled into the woman's bedroom and Mzuvukile apparently forced his way into the house, locked the door and stabbed her.Case postponedNomala previously told the court that when he arrived at the grisly scene, a wall was covered in blood and Vuyiseka's bloody body lay on her friend's bed.Mzuvukile was arrested by the responding officers at his home.Nomala said a post-mortem found a sexual act had occurred before Vuyiseka's death.Mzuvukile, a project administrator, during his testimony at the start of his bail application elected to remain silent on the merits of the case.The couple had three children together, while Mzuvukile has another outside the marriage.At the start of his bail application he had told Magistrate Goolam Bawa that he had stabbed his wife, but claimed he had not been told she had died of her wounds.The matter was postponed to April 4. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
