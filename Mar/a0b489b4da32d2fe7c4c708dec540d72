The parents are on trial on 42 charges including rape, child and sexual abuse, and drug dealing and possession. They may not be named to protect the identities of their five children, some of whom are minors. Police arrived at the house on the East Rand in May 2014, after the couple’s son ran to a neighbour for help. The father was arrested on May 23. On Monday, Netwerk24 reported that the mother testified that if she didn’t agree to have sex with her husband, he would beat her. She told the court that the man used a device to shock their two oldest children and burned them with a blowtorch.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
