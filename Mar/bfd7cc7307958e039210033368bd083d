Quoting diplomats and government sources, the report said that the west African country leader was spending between one and four hours a day in his office to "conserve his energy levels". "Things are slowing down, particularly on the economic front, which is a concern," a Western diplomat was quoted as saying. Buhari, 74, returned to work a few weeks ago after nearly two months' medical leave in Britain. During his absence, his office had repeatedly denied claims the leader was ill and insisted he was "hale and hearty".But when he returned home, a gaunt-looking Buhari said he "couldn't recall being so sick since I was a young man" and described receiving "blood transfusions".Reports indicated that Buhari was due to return to Britain for further treatment in April.The nature of his illness has not been revealed.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
