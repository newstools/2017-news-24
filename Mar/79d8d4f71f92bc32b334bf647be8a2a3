It has capacity to produce 225 000 barrels of oil and 150 million cubic feet of gas a day.The scheduled maintenance comes as Nigeria tries to export as much oil as possible amid a foreign currency crisis. Militant attacks last year cut production by up to 1 million barrels a day. The government has said production is up to between 1.7 million and 2.2 million barrels a day. Oil provides 80% of government revenue.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
