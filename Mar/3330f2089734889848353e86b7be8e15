With years to do so, nothing happened.On Wednesday, the court reserved judgment in an application by the Black Sash for it to supervise any new contract, and its implementation, to pay social grants.List of demandsAbout 6 000 Nehawu members in the department went on strike on Monday, after talks over their grievances collapsed on Sunday night. They are social workers, childcare workers, managers of homes and care centres, and administrative staffers.Nehawu spokesperson Khaya Xaba said the union's issues with the department date back to August 2015, and had not been addressed adequately. Marches around the country on February 10 did not help either.Their demands include the introduction of an occupation specific dispensation, which sets specific salaries for certain types of workers; the introduction of a rural allowance; for unemployed social workers to be employed permanently; and improved service conditions.They want youth development centres currently run by the private company Bosasa to be insourced, and for contract employees at the gender-based violence command centre to become permanent employees.Xaba said Sassa employees had complained about being underpaid, alleged corruption, anti-union behaviour, and nepotism.At the end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016, the Congress of SA Trade Unions-aligned union brought Parliament to a standstill in a dispute over bonuses.The department could not immediately be reached for comment.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
