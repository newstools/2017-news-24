Selloane Khalane A manhunt for two male robbers posing as police officials has ensued, the police has said. The pair stole an ­undisclosed amount of uncut diamonds, as well as an undisclosed sum of money at a house in Universitas Ridge, ­Bloemfontein, on Thursday, 23 March, in the afternoon. According to police spokesperson Wendy Nkabi, a case of robbery has been opened and the assailants are being sought. Nkabi said the men brandished a fake police identification card to the owner of the house and his son before entering the house in Wickie Mostert Street. “Shortly after entering the house, the suspects tied the hands of the house owner and his 22-year-old son and forced them into the (father’s) bedroom.  “The suspects ransacked the place, looking for ­valuables,” Nkabi said. The suspects allegedly found bags full of money and uncut diamonds after torturing the father. “The son sustained injuries to the head as the suspects assaulted him with the butt of the firearm,” she said. Nkabi said the suspects had initially asked to be led to the safe in which they did not find anything. She said no shots were fired during the incident. A manhunt has been issued for the two assailants. They fled the scene in a white Toyota Hilux bakkie. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
