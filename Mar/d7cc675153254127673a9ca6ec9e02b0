In his court papers, Mahumapelo said he was worried that the forum intended to intensify its smear campaign.Mahumapelo was not immediately available for comment."He did not respond to us, he withdrew the matter from court. We were meant to be in court today, but the premier has denied us a rare opportunity to convict him in a court of law. He leaves the public with no option but to convict him in a court of public opinion," Mogodiri said."We stand by what we said. He should resign with immediate effect."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
