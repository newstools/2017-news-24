The Express-Times in Easton reports John and Godever Ibechem were sentenced on Thursday to serve nine months in federal prison each. The Palmer Township couple acknowledged they plotted to smuggle the woman in to care for their two young boys and failed to pay her minimum wage. She was paid about $20 every other week to provide around-the-clock care. Prosecutors say she was swindled out of about $205 000 in wages, though the attorney for the Ibechems says they also sent money to her family in Nigeria. The Ibechems agreed to pay the nanny $50 000 as part a plea deal. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
