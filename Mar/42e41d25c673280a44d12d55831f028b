If he uses this Doom in his house on himself, it is not a problem."Masilo and the department failed to submit an expert's statement on the complications that might be caused by inhaling Doom, while Lubisi argued that the insect repellent was administered to people who volunteered."If the State wants to interfere and dictate on how churches should operate, it should be done according to the law," said Lubisi.Phatudi lambasted the pastor, saying he was neither a scientist, nor a chemical expert.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
