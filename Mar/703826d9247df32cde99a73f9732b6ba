Dlamini had until March 31 to show why she should not be joined to the proceedings in her personal capacity, and why she should not pay the costs of the application from her own pocket.On Saturday morning a total of 15 computers containing confidential information of all the South African judges, judiciary staff and all the courts was stolen from the office of the chief justice.&nbsp;Acting police national commissioner Lieutenant General Khomotso Phahlane said that a multi-disciplinary task team would investigate the matter.Breytenbach welcomed the appointment of the team.&nbsp;"Attacks on the judiciary cannot be allowed to stand and must be dealt with with the urgency and seriousness they deserve," she said.&nbsp;"The DA will be submitting parliamentary questions as to why there wasn't adequate security at the office of the chief justice which allowed for the break-in to occur."DA chief whip John Steenhuisen said on Twitter that it was possible that State Security Minister David Mahlobo and the State Security Agency could have had a hand in the burglary. "My money's on Mahlobo and the kak-handed SSA. Signal jammer, imaginary social media villains and inept break ins. Intimidation of judiciary," he tweeted.&nbsp;The ANC responded that Steenhuisen made "wild, untested allegations impugning individuals without a shred of evidence to back it up".&nbsp;"The ANC directs Steenhuisen and his ilk to present to the relevant authorities and South Africans at large evidence he is relying on to make draw inferences and make allegations against... Comrade David Mahlobo in this matter," ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said.&nbsp;"We have said and continue to reiterate that all and everyone with information in this matter must co-operate with law enforcement agencies to bring the perpetrators to book. Should he fail to do this, the ANC expects an unconditional apology to Cde Mahlobo and the ANC on the very same platform Steenhuisen uses to tarnish the reputation of our leaders."Kodwa said the ANC trusts that Mahlobo would also consider taking legal action against Steenhuisen.&nbsp;"Wild allegations, frivolous conspiracy theories do nothing but to feed into a reckless frenzy in society, more so from those who claim to be leaders."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
