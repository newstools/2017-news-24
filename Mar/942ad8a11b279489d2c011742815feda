She was arrested on November 21, 2015.Khumalo and Hlophe had gone to a tavern on the day, her Legal Aid defence Cebo Vilakazi said."After we finished the fourth quart of beer, a man greeted me in front of my lover, which angered him. We left for another place, but he started assaulting me, accusing me of cheating on him," she said.Once they had returned home, he continued assaulting and accusing her of being unfaithful."As he continued beating me up, I walked out to the back yard. He went to the fence and pulled out a stick to use it on me. Seeing that he was not prepared to stop, I walked into the house and took a knife from the kitchen. I walked outside, ready to fight back if he attacked me," she said.She stabbed him in the heart."I could have acted differently instead of fighting back using a knife. I know what I did is punishable by law," she said.Geldenhuys said the court was satisfied that she had shown remorse and taken responsibility for her actions.Four years of the 12-year sentence would be suspended for five years. They would come into effect should she be found guilty of an offence like attempted murder, murder, culpable homicide, assault, or common assault during the five-year period.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
