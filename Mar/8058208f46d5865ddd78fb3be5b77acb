 Inspiring young man. May God continue blessing you and giving you the strength you need on your journey. You are a real fighter and an overcomer. Mandisa song called “You are a overcomer”. May God be with you Miso.

 Miso, my thoughts and prayers are with you young man. I watched you last night in the schools performance of Noises OFF and was totally blown away by your excellent performance - this done in the face of illness. You are amazing and a very brave young man.
