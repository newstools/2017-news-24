The Medias24 website said the foreign ministry had been asked "to inform the French authorities of the illegality of the sale and to request the return of the skeleton to its country of origin".The Moroccan authorities have not commented publicly on the subject.APPGM said Morocco's geological heritage was globally recognised for its richness and diversity.But it added that "in the absence of regulatory texts... this heritage is undergoing a systematic and continuous deterioration."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
