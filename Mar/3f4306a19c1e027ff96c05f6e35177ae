This will have serious implications on the defence function of the Republic of South Africa," she said at the time.She said the department had consistently indicated the defence allocation should be incrementally increasing toward at least 2% of GDP, "yet defence is consistently 50% underfunded, with compounding effects on our ability to conduct operations". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
