The vehicle was abandoned in Montclair, south of Durban and since then, police and volunteers have been fanning out in the hopes of finding her.She was wearing her nappy and a little white vest when she was last seen.In an interview with local radio station East Coast Radio, the infant's mother said, "I am pleading with the public to please help me find my child. And also to the suspects if they are listening wherever they are, it's not pleasant at all."Marshall Security is part of the search team, and spokesperson Kyle van Reenen said police and volunteers spent Friday night and Saturday morning searching bushes near where the car was dumped, but with no luck.PIC | #SiwaphiweMbambo father Felokwakhe with his son, Muvo, 8, who was in the car that was hijacked. ??: @sbonisomngadi #HelpFindDurbanBaby pic.twitter.com/gdMg2nMrBY&mdash; Sunday Tribune ??
