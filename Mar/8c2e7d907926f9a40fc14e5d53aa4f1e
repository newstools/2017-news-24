It wants the court to ensure that the present payment contractor, Cash Paymaster Services (CPS), acts &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; in negotiating a new contract with Sassa, and that Sassa reports to the court.In its demands, R2K said it wanted clarity regarding the current contract with CPS, which expires on March 31.&ldquo;Bathabile Dlamini is angering us because she is not being accountable, nor is she giving the public clear answers. We&rsquo;re here today to stand for the millions of grant receivers including the elderly, disabled, women and children. All we want is truth. If she cannot answer any of the public&rsquo;s questions, she must step down,&rdquo; said R2K&rsquo;s Sandile Khwela.&ldquo;We want any information regarding a new contract to be public. No more secrets, no more lies,&rdquo; said R2K co-ordinator Ngazini Ngidi.Morine Shozi, 63, from Umlazi, who supports a family of nine with her old age pension, could not imagine what would happen if she did not get her money.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what we would do. We are barely surviving with my grant money and the child support grant for my grandchild. My family and I would have to go to bed hungry. Sassa cannot let that happen. Grants are a human right and we cannot suffer because of their botched deals,&rdquo; she said.R2K handed a memorandum entitled &ldquo;Hands off our grants&rdquo; to Sassa KwaZulu-Natal communications manager Mbizeni Molalose.&ldquo;People will receive their grants as normal on 1 April,&rdquo; Molalose said.Sassa&rsquo;s Nolubabalo Ntsinga, 40, who depends on the disability grant, said though the turnout was smaller than expected, she was happy to stand in the rain and demonstrate her frustration.&ldquo;We cannot have a minister who acts like Bathabile Dlamini. Such a critical survival resource for the poorest people is now at risk,&rdquo; she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
