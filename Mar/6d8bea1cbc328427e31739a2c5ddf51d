The spacewalk by France's Thomas Pesquet, 39 and American Shane Kimbrough 49, officially began when the duo switched their spacesuits to internal battery power. Pesquet and Kimbrough are installing new docking ports for the next generation of commercial spacecraft and do some minor space station repairs and maintenance. The new crew spaceships, being designed by SpaceX and Boeing, should begin flying astronauts to the station in the coming years...as early as 2018. Currently, the only way the world's astronauts can reach orbit is by buying a ride aboard Russia's Soyuz capsules, at $81m per seat. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
