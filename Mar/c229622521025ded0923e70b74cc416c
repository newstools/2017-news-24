The officials, through the Secretary General, Cde Gwede Mantashe, indicated that the matter would be referred to the National Executive Committee for further deliberations and clarity," Lungisa said in the letter, which News24 has seen.A party insider, who supports Zuma, admitted that - while Lungisa was a strong ally needed to campaign for support in the Eastern Cape - it wouldn't be easy defending him, as other leaders like Deputy Minister of Agriculture Bheki Cele and Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane, who are both NEC members, were previously barred from contesting positions in lower structures.He said the other alternative was for Lungisa to challenge the interpretation of the rule with the courts, but he would risk suspension, as the party does not take kindly to members challenging it in court.Dlamini to face her colleaguesThis is the first time the NEC is meeting since the social grants debacle.Dlamini will face her colleagues after the Constitutional Court slammed her for "incompetence" and for failing to perform her constitutional obligation to find a new service provider, after the court found that the contract with Cash Paymaster Services was invalid.Dlamini has already been hauled before the party's integrity commission.She is expected to explain to the court next week, why she should not be held personally liable for the legal costs.Two party insiders - from the Zuma and anti-Zuma factions, admitted that if the matter was raised within the NEC, "it will lead to a fight". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
