At least 12 aid workers have been killed so far this year and at least 79 killed since 2013, according to the UN."We are extremely saddened by this undeserved event," said Pius Ojara, director of the NGO Forum in South Sudan. "These are people who were here to serve the population." Ojara said police are investigating to find out who killed the aid workers.Grieving families gathered on Monday outside the morgue in Juba to collect and bury their dead."This is very painful for all of us," said Levis Kori. Kori's 30-year-old brother John Riti, was killed in the attack."We're not enemies," said Kori. "They were humanitarians there to do good. They're not soldiers they have no guns."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
