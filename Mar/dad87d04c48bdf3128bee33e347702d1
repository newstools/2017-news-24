Maunye will face a disciplinary hearing soon, which will determine the fate of his position in the provincial legislature. Maunye accepted his organisation&rsquo;s decision, saying he was still committed to programmes to unite the people of Bushbuckridge, who are divided along tribal lines that perpetuate the apartheid legacy. He said many competent people in the region were not given the opportunity to serve in government because they come from &ldquo;a tribe&rdquo; that was discriminated against.&ldquo;If the BRA can negotiate with the ANC, we can break that barrier and people can get deployments and employment [equitably],&rdquo; he said.City Press understands that even though he is in jail, Mokoena was particularly concerned that Maunye could end up getting a higher position than him within the ANC&rsquo;s provincial executive if the deal went through while he was locked up.Provincial ANC secretary Mandla Ndlovu said the ANC would still try to negotiate, adding that it was unfair to punish Maunye because the ANC had met with many BRA leaders.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
