Knives, axes, road signs and hard disks were presented as evidence.Outside, supporters of the two camps, separated by a line of policemen, exchanged slogans and insults."No to impunity for killers!" shouted dozens of victims' relatives, waving Moroccan flags and pictures of soldiers killed."Freedom for political prisoners!" shouted a crowd of Sahrawi activists.A military court in 2013 sentenced the 25 defendants to punishment ranging from 20 years to life imprisonment following a high-profile legal drama.International NGOs condemned the trial as "unfair", and in July the Court of Cassation ordered a new trial in a civilian court.Defence lawyers on Monday said they had little faith that the new trial would deliver justice.The trial "is taking place in very unfair conditions, but we remain at the defendants' side," they said.Ahmed Atertour, president of an association for families and friends of the victims, said he had "confidence in Moroccan justice to commemorate the memory of our (...) martyrs".Morocco says Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony under its control, is an integral part of the kingdom.The Algeria-backed Polisario Front demands a referendum on self-determination for the territory.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
