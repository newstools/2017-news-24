The Drugs and Trafficking Act defines what constitutes a drug.&nbsp;They are also challenging the Medicines and Related Substances Act.They submitted that the laws prohibiting dagga use are unfair, discriminatory, outdated, and applied disproportionately to black users.The two have been helping people arrested for possession of dagga by obtaining a stay of prosecution, pending the outcome of their application.&nbsp;Prince was arrested for possession of dagga in 1989, while a law student at the University of the Western Cape.He paid a R60 fine and though that was the end of it. When he graduated and applied to the Cape Bar to be admitted as an attorney, he was rejected because of the dagga conviction, and because he refused to apologise for it.To Prince, using dagga was a religious choice as a Rastafarian. He unsuccessfully brought an application to the Constitutional Court to have it decriminalised for religious purposes.He became a community legal adviser, but was arrested again in 2012 for growing dagga in his garden in Kraaifontein.His case was among those stayed, pending the judgment on Friday.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
