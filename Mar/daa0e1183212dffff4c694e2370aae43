"What they are doing is against the law. Resources have been sent to ensure that the routes are re-opened and so that traffic can flow again."He said most of the trucks have already moved, and that efforts were being made to re-open the N4 and N1.It was not immediately clear what the truckers' demands are.#TruckStrike #TruckDriverProtest in Pretorius street, Pretoria make their way to the Union Buildings. pic.twitter.com/M5MI91syxSProtest actions today! 14 employees not earning a cent today, my company stands still!
