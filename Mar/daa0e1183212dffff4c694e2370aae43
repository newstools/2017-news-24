Its incredibly hot in Pta @News24 #TruckDriverProtest pic.twitter.com/KL9i8SkIsnThe battle between coal and renewables&nbsp;News from Cabinet ministers that the government s flagship Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme (REIPP) has to date unlocked R200bn in investment commitments and created more than 115 000 jobs over the lifespan of the projects, does not bode well for the coal truckers plight. The coal truckers are protesting Eskom s decision not to renew contracts with 48 transport companies because weak demand, slow economic growth and the introduction of new supply from independent producers has resulted in a 3 million metric-ton coal surplus. Last month President Jacob Zuma said the power utility must sign agreements to buy power from private producers. Eskom had stalled the programme, saying it no longer requires additional renewable energy. The coal truck drivers, who are blocking roads surrounding Pretoria, maintain that Eskom is too big to fail and is in position to say no to IPPs. A plan by Eskom to close its Camden, Grootvlei, Hendrina and Kriel electricity plants by end-March 2020, will result in as many as 20 000 job losses, according to acting CEO Matshela Koko.#TruckDriverProtest arrives at the Union Buildings @News24 pic.twitter.com/n3QyJySbVEWorkers are out in heavy numbers protesting against Zuma&#39;s recent announcement @News24 #TruckDriverProtest pic.twitter.com/PHfB6RJ6dg#TruckDriverProtest @News24 pic.twitter.com/e1Z0pAHYAKWe are making our way into the Union Buildings #TruckDriverProtest @News24 pic.twitter.com/yYth7KLtlrTraffic on Hamilton and Madiba also at a complete standstill in order to allow the convoy through @News24 #TruckDriverProtest pic.twitter.com/GlkFsn0MoUWe did not strong arm the public.
