President Faustin-Archange Touadera took office in March 2016 with a mandate to lead a transition to peace but much of the country remains under the control of armed groups.Bakouma boasts large uranium deposits and the military source said the violence there was "very worrying".Troops from the UN peacekeeping mission known as MINUSCA have been unable to access the town, Vladimir Monteiro, a spokesperson for the mission, said on Wednesday.The uranium deposits were bought by Canadian company UraMin in 2007 from French energy giant Areva which suspended activities in the region in 2012. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
