Colleagues from ACSA issued a statement with some detail, and I don't think we are prepared to repeat what is out there in the public domain. Even if we were to be told that the amount is R24m or R20m, it is still subject to an investigation and needs to be clarified.&nbsp;"In this press briefing, we are not going to be talking to that detail."&nbsp;Phahlane: the investigation will identify security short comings &amp; implement measures to prevent any incident happening again #ORTIArobbery#ORTamboHeist Phahlane: Our responsibilty is to safeguard the airport because it is a national keypoint. @News24#ORTamboHeist Phahlane says allegations that you can pay someone to gain access to restricted areas, are concerning. @News24#ORTamboHeist Phahlane says the journalist should share the information that she was able to gather when she went to the airport yesterday.#ORTamboHeist Phahlane the area that the journalist was in was not a restricted area. @News24Phahlane is now taking questions from the media present.
