Malema, now commander-in-chief of the EFF, was expelled from the ruling party in 2012.He has gone on to become one of the ANC's biggest detractors, often calling for the party's president Jacob Zuma to step down."If it means lifting his suspension will strengthen the ANC let's do it because the ANC is at a crossroad," said Maine."We need to do anything to strengthen the organisation and it would require us to do certain things that ordinarily we would not do," he added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
