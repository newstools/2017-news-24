Critics argue that any exported horns would be hard to monitor and likely would end up on the commercial market, defying global agreements to protect threatened rhino populations.Most of the world's rhino live in South Africa. An international ban on trade in rhino horns has been in place since 1977, and South Africa imposed a moratorium on the domestic trade in 2009, when rhino poaching was accelerating to meet growing demand for horns in parts of Asia, especially Vietnam.South Africa's government has lost court battles to preserve the 2009 ban, which was challenged by rhino breeders, and has leaned toward trade, backing a failed proposal by neighbouring Swaziland at a UN wildlife conference in Johannesburg last year to legalise the international sale of rhino horn.A 30-day period during which the public was invited to express opinions about the draft legislation on rhino horn trade ended on Friday, the Department of Environmental Affairs said."The comments will be evaluated, the draft regulatory provisions will be revised based on the comments received, and the process for approval of the final legislation will be set in motion," the department said in an email to The Associated Press.Foreigners&nbsp;A foreigner who takes rhino horns out of the country must do so through OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg and cannot carry them in hand luggage, according to the draft provisions. They say authorised freight agents must provide authorities with DNA data and other information related to exported horns. Sceptics believe the system would be open to corruption.Some consumers in Asia believe rhino horn in powder form can cure illnesses, although there is no evidence that the horn, made of the same substance as human fingernails, has any medicinal value.Critics say legalisation will spur poaching as illegally obtained horns are laundered into the legal market, similar to the exploitation of elephant ivory. Rhino breeders, however, believe poaching would be undercut by a regulated trade, which likely would allow the sale of horn stockpiles and the harvesting of horns from living rhino.The poaching is not confined to South Africa. This month, a 5-year-old white rhino was shot three times in the head by poachers who broke into the Thoiry Zoo near Paris and used a chain saw to remove the rhino's horn."Banning the trade in horn has made the horn more and more and more valuable. Had we never banned it, the price of horn would never have got to where it is now," said John Hume, a rhino breeder in South Africa. "And that Parisian rhino would have been safe in its zoo because its horn would have been worth a fraction of what it is."'Step in the right direction'Hume described South Africa's draft legislation on the domestic rhino horn trade as "a step in the right direction".But Allison Thomson, a South African campaigner against legalisation, said putting rhino horns on the market would increase demand and that South Africa is sending "conflicting messages" about how to deal with poaching, jeopardising its lucrative wildlife tourism."The risk we run at the moment is that if we open up trade and poaching escalates we will have no rhinos in the wild. We will only have rhino on farms, being farmed like cows," Thomson said.Poachers killed 1 054 rhino in South Africa last year, a 10% drop from 2015, according to the government. While authorities attributed the decrease to increased security and other anti-poaching measures, some conservationists speculate that there are fewer rhino to kill. Drought also killed some rhino in the past year.By some estimates, South Africa has nearly 20 000 rhino, or 80 percent of Africa's population. Asia has several rhino species, including two that are critically endangered.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
