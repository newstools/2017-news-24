Days later, the SABC said it would comply with the decision.On Tuesday, the National Assembly adopted the final SABC inquiry report. It recommends that the 2016 editorial policy be scrapped and that the current SABC board be dissolved.On Wednesday, Parliament&rsquo;s communications committee agreed on five names it would recommend to the National Assembly to constitute an interim SABC board.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
