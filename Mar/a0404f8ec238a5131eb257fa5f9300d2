They were married on November 14 of that year, and Louisa's three children moved with them.The case file says: "The teenager was chased out of the house and she went to live with her granny. She was forbidden to go home and the emotional and verbal abuse against her continued."Both accused also allegedly physically and emotionally abused the two small children."Although the State does not really know the exact conditions, the accused, among others, shouted at, hit, kicked, pulled or twisted their ears, put the hosepipe on them during freezing weather, cut off the girl's hair and threw them against solid objects."During this period, the children regularly suffered injuries and had bruises. They also exhibited improper emotional behaviour."Assaulted the childrenSocial workers started monitoring and assessing the children's surroundings.&nbsp; The charge sheet said they considered removing the children from the accused's care. Louisa and Kobus then fled Orania with Poppie and her brother in September 2016.They moved to Brits on October 3. Poppie was "seriously assaulted" on October 25."The deceased's body was riddled with bruises and marks. The cause of death: head injuries as a result of assault with a blunt instrument."The State will allege that both the accused were active participants in assaulting the children. In cases where just one adult committed the act, the other actively encouraged or didn't protect the children and disregarded his or her legal duty."The Koekemoers remain in custody.Poppie's paternal grandmother and grandfather sat behind the accused in the public gallery. They travelled more than four hours from their home to attend the court case.A picture of a laughing Poppie was pinned to the grandfather's shirt.* The grandfather and grandmother, Poppie and her brother and her stepsister may not be identified because the children are minors and foster parent procedures are currently underway.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
