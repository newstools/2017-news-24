Sassa later told the court it would internally take over payments by 2017.However, it has since become clear the agency does not have the capacity to conduct this and it has turned to trying to renegotiate with CPS &ndash; a move treasury does not support.Meanwhile, the Presidency weighed in on the situation after reports emerged on Sunday that President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s special advisor Michael Hulley had attended meetings with the minister and other Sassa officials about the payments of grants."The Presidency is not aware of the said meetings," said presidential spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga in a statement.Gordhan has accepted an invitation to attend a standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) meeting on Tuesday to discuss the looming social grants crisis.Scopa confirmed on Friday that it had received a letter from Gordhan indicating his intention to account before the committee this Tuesday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
