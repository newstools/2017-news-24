At its general synod in 2015, the church decided that gay preachers need no longer be celibate and that individual church councils could decide if they would allow civil unions between homosexual couples. An appeal was lodged against the decision and, after a year of drama and threats of legal action, the church rescinded the decision at an extraordinary synod in 2016. According to that decision, only a sexual relationship between a man and a woman in a marriage is acceptable. This week, church officials decided to hand the documents of all task teams and the synod, which resulted in the about-turn, to the 11 congregants. However, the notes of the commission which handled the appeals against the 2015 decision would not be made available as they contained information from third parties, said the chair, Dominee Nelis Janse van Rensburg. This was not allowed in terms of the law, unless the third party gave permission. If necessary, they would attempt to get permission. Janse van Rensburg said the minutes of the extraordinary synod could only be approved now, which was why there was a delay in releasing the documents. The 11 congregants had asked for the documents in terms of the Promotion of Access to Information Act. They said it was in the public interest, for the sake of justice, and to uphold human dignity.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
