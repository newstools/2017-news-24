Arjan Babaj is one of three Kosovars arrested in the case. One allegedly was caught on a phone intercept proposing a bomb attack on the famed Rialto bridge. A minor was also detained. Bedri Babaj told The Associated Press on Friday he believes his son is innocent. He argued that there are few practicing Muslims in Venice and that this may have aroused suspicions.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
