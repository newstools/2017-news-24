Her son was apparently initially too scared to tell anybody about the alleged spanking last week Tuesday, because the principal at the boarding school threatened to expel him if he said anything. The boy's friends noticed him crying, and he eventually confided in them. One of the children told his parents what had happened, and they contacted the boy's mother. His mother said it happened because he had not folded his clothes properly."He is only 7," she said.Call for principal to be firedDepartment spokesperson Millicent Merten said they had been informed and were investigating because the Schools Act makes corporal punishment illegal. "The Western Cape education department views incidents of corporal punishment in a serious light and fully investigates all allegations reported to the department," she said on Thursday. "Our district office will offer the necessary support to the learner, as required." Local politician Dawid Kamfer of the Independent Congress of SA (Icosa) called for the removal of the principal. "Icosa regards this incident in a very serious light and asks that the principal is removed immediately," said Kamfer. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
