It had not attempted to determine any guilt.The federal executive would decide whether to refer the matter to a panel for a disciplinary hearing. If this happened, the panel would conduct a process to make a finding and a recommendation.Selfe previously said the federal executive had to accept the panel&rsquo;s finding, and could only increase or reduce the sanction with good reason.DA distances itselfZille's political career is hanging in the balance following her tweets on Thursday, March 16, from which the party was quick to distance itself.Following a visit to Singapore, and reading up on Singapore's post-colonial success, Zille posted several tweets, including: "For those claiming legacy of colonialism was ONLY negative, think of our independent judiciary, transport infrastructure, piped water etc."A second tweet read: "Getting onto an aeroplane now and won't get onto the wi-fi so that I can cut off those who think EVERY aspect of colonial legacy was bad."She explained her thoughts in a column the following Monday.DA leader Mmusi Maimane told City Press last week that he considered comments, suggesting he was scared to act against Zille, as racist."I think that is wrong on two accounts. There is an undertone which says black people can&rsquo;t lead except when they are managed by white people, which I think is racist at its core. I think it undermines Africans; it undermines us as a people," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
