American Michael Sharp and Swedish national Zaida Catalan "lost their lives seeking to understand the causes of conflict and insecurity in the DRC in order to help bring peace to the country and its people," Guterres said in a statement. "I trust that the Congolese authorities will conduct a full investigation into this incident. The United Nations will also conduct an inquiry. In case of criminal acts, the United Nations will do everything possible to ensure that justice is done." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
