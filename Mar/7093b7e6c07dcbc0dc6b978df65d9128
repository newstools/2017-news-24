Why is it that a rich kid from Guatemala gets to stay in the prison hospital section?"Dougherty has dual Guatemalan and Italian nationality and his prominent family lives in Guatemala.He reportedly sexually assaulted and strangled Alban to death.Dougherty faces a minimum of 15 years in jail if convicted. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
