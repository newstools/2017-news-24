He asked customers to continue to pay their accounts on time.&nbsp;"Customers should immediately make payment arrangements if they are unable to pay to avoid attracting credit control actions against them," Maphologela said.&nbsp;Customers could contact the City's call centre on 0860-562-874 for any account queries.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
