In the United States, fully 10% of public lighting has already switched over to LED.That is good news for the fight against global warming, cutting on fossil-fuel burning for electricity, but it may be bad news for health, the AMA cautioned."Some LED lights are harmful when used as street lighting," AMA board member Maya Babu said in a statement.Not only do the bluish, high-intensity lights create a view-obscuring glare, they have "five times greater impact on circadian sleep rhythms than conventional street lamps", the AMA concluded.The new technology also obscured our view on the night sky even more than traditional city lighting."LEDs could double or triple the luminosity of the sky" - which means the stars get lost against the background, said the authors of a 2016 world atlas of night sky brightness.Bit by bit, citizens are starting to push back.A petition circulating in Madrid is calling for a scientific study on the safety and health impacts of LED lighting.In the Canadian cities of Quebec and Montreal, along with Phoenix in Arizona, public pressure has already pushed city officials to install "yellow" LEDs, which are thought to be less disturbing.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
