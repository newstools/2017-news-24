It constitutes a brazen attack on the judiciary, and was clearly orchestrated. &nbsp; "It is now upon the highest political authority to prove this attack did not take place without explicit or implicit consent, and government must investigate this heinous act with great urgency lest elements within it be deemed to be complicit."Save SA said it cannot allow the judicial system to be attacked and undermined in a similar way.It called on South Africans to voice their objection and demonstrate their support for an independent judiciary, in defence of the country&rsquo;s democracy. &nbsp; The stolen computers contained important and sensitive information about judges in South Africa and officials in the office of the chief justice, the Constitutional Court, high courts, Supreme Court of Appeal and other specialist courts. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
