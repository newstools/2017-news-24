He will be closing #SCOPA meeting soon. @News24Dlamini says it is up to the portfolio committee to suggest starting a full inquiry into the #SASSA matter. #SCOPA @News24Dlamini on timeframes. She says they are receiving report on new CPS contract from technical team this Friday. #SASSA #SCOPA @News24She agrees that #SCOPA can continue to engage with the department and #SASSA. @News24Dlamini says the portfolio committee is better placed than #SCOPA to mentor them. #SASSA @News24Dlamini says they are going to reintegrate information from re-registration. Sometimes they lose names. #SASSA #SCOPA @News24Booi says Parliament wants to ensure that #SASSA remains &quot;our baby&quot;. #SCOPA @News24ANC&#39;s Booi says the dept needs to be &quot;mentored&quot; through this process, otherwise CPS will be here for a long time. #SASSA #SCOPA @News24ANC&#39;s Kekana wants to know timelines for CPS contract negotiations. #SASSA @News24New welfare system for SA by 2019&nbsp;South Africa plans to bring in a new welfare-payments system over the next two years and hasn t yet signed a new interim contract with Net 1 UEPS Technologies, the government said. Cash Paymaster Services, a unit of Net 1, will continue making payments while new social-grants arrangements are implemented, Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini told reporters in Pretoria on Sunday. The welfare department is still negotiating a new deal with the company, whose existing disbursement contract ends on March 31, according to Dumisile Ndlovu, the department s acting executive manager for corporate services. The department and South African Social Security Agency, or Sassa, are scrambling to ensure more than 17 million people continue to get their money next month. The payments of more than R140bn a year are a signature policy of the ANC, which says the grants are an important measure to reduce inequality in the nation almost 23 years after the end of white-minority rule. In previous election campaigns, ANC officials have told rallies that if another party came to power, the payments may end. On 1 April, Sassa begins a new era, Dlamini said, adding a transition phase would end in March 2019. As has been the case in the past, no one will go unpaid. &nbsp;Hlengwa wants to know why #SASSA lead Zodwa Mvulane said they won&#39;t approach the ConCourt last week, yet went there later that day. @News24Dept officials have much better grip on the procurement process than #BathabileDlamini. Pity she&#39;s so defensive! #SCOPABrauteseth asks the plan is to blame Treasury when it does not approve new CPS contract in their &quot;self-created&quot; emergency. #SASSA @News24Ross asks Dlamini if she would support a public inquiry into the #SASSA crisis. #SCOPA @News24DA&#39;s Ross says the minister needs to intervene and release a joint stadium with Treasury. #SASSA #SCOPA @News24Scopa chair apologises to Dlamini and says "just five more minutes"...&nbsp;Dlamini just pointed to her watch and told the chair &quot;time&quot;. #SASSA @SCOPA @News24Questions now being posed to #SASSA CFO Chauke. @News24She says dept reached the original tender deadline of August 2015, but they could not foresee they would receive unresponsive bids. @News24A dept official now telling the committee why the new tender processes took two years to complete. #SASSA #SCOPA @News24A bit of back and forth between Ndlozi and the minister about past misdemeanours. #SASSA #SCOPA @News24Dlamini says it seems they are being pushed in two directions, to do the work or to be lame ducks. #SASSA #SCOPA @News24Dlamini repeating her points on the Post Office, BEE compliance and Treasury correspondence. #SASSA #SCOPA @News24Dlamini: I&#39;m speaking the truth here. I don&#39;t want to end up lying because I want to impress you. #SASSA #SCOPA @News24Dlamini repeats they have not finalized the negotiations. #SASSA #SCOPA @News24Dlamini now mentioning names of officials who worked during the work streams. She says they are experts. #SCOPA #SASSA @News24Dlamini also says she is not passing the buck. They have taken responsibility for the #SASSA crisis. #SCOPA @News24Dlamini says she doesn&#39;t appoint herself. A minister is appointed by the president. #SASSA #SCOPA @News24Ndlozi: These are your failures. So why should you still be a minister, if you cannot handle #SASSA? #SCOPA @News24Ndlozi says it seems the central problem according to the minister is other officials in #SASSA. But she appoints them. #SCOPA @News24Post Office CEO: We are ready and willing to take over Sassa payments&nbsp;South African Post Office (SAPO) CEO Mark Barnes said the parastatal is finding it difficult to understand why it is not tasked with distributing social grants. South Africa s social grants are currently under the spotlight as concern grows over whether 17 million recipients will receive their payments next month amid a contract expiry. In 2014, the Constitutional Court declared the R10bn grant payments tender run by Net1 UEPS Cash Paymaster Services as invalid amid irregularities in the awarding of the deal. Subsequently, the court ordered the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) to reissue the tender. Sassa did not award a new contract as it said the bids were non-compliant. The agency said it was not ready to assume the payment function itself by April 1, as previously planned, putting the welfare project in limbo.&nbsp;ANC&#39;s Khunou says there are other firms who can manage the social grants programme besides CPS. #SASSA #SCOPA @News24ANC&#39;s Khunou says she is disappointed that the DG is not here, as they are the ones who must account for the PFMA. #SCOPA #SASSA @News24Sassa 'skimming the poor' the outrage mounts&nbsp;Zohra Dawood, Director of the&nbsp;Centre for Unity in Diversity,&nbsp;is incensed and outraged. That much is clear from the literary blow she delivers here to Sassa s executives and their&nbsp;minister, Bathabile Dlamini. In 2014, no less than the&nbsp;Constitutional Court gave Sassa&nbsp;until October the following year to reissue the five-year tender, finding it was granted irregularly to&nbsp;Cash Paymaster Services&nbsp;(CPS) back in 2012. Sassa failed to do this, whining as the court deadline whizzed past that all of the new bids were non-responsive in mandatory administrative functionality . It s now three years later. OK, let s be generous. Take the 17 months since Sassa allegedly discovered none of the eager aspirant replacements could do the job. Did they spread the net or facilitate collaboration? Is there not a single other outfit in this country that can do the job? (CPS hoped to continue on the back of Sassa s desperate but aborted recent court bid for condolence.)&nbsp;ANC&#39;s Khunou wants to ask Treasury a question. #SASSA @News24Chiloane: Will the new CPS contract deviations affect other agency programmes in the department? #SASSA @News24ANC&#39;s Chiloane now up. #SASSA #SCOPA @News24Booi says there has been no new tendering process by CPS, so the old players are still there. #SCOPA #SASSA @News24Booi says the part they are interested in, is who are the players in CPS? #SASSA @News24Booi asks the minister if she can provide names to #SCOPA of those officials who have held up the process. #SASSA @News24ANC&#39;s Booi now up. Given the time period, and the minister is partially blaming other officials. #SASSA @News24Minister Bathabile Dlamini is a national embarrassment and typifies the unaccountable arrogance and uncaring attitude of the ANC.Dlamini responds: That is a huge indictment. I cannot speak for Treasury. #SASSA @News24He said Treasury has said it will not condone deviations from the contract with CPS, period. #SASSA @News24Brauteseth says the minister is misleading Parliament. #SASSA @News24MPs can be heard moaning, &quot;But the contract&#39;s been signed?&quot; Dlamini repeats they are &quot;still negotiating&quot;. #SASSA @News24 Jump to top
