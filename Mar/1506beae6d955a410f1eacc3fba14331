Makhosandile ZuluTHE ANC Youth League (ANCYL) in the Greater KwaDukuza region has condemned certain iLembe District Municipality councillors whom the league claims are destabilising the municipality by staying away from council meetings as a form of protest demanding they be paid certain allowances.This is according to the league's regional secretary, Musa Zondi who was speaking at a press briefing recently.Zondi said these councillors are from the ANC and their actions have led to the polarisation of the district's councillors representing the organisation."The ANCYL in the Greater KwaDukuza region is very disturbed with the problematic conduct of some ANC councillors in the iLembe District Municipality; these councillors are overly inclined in secondary matters than serving the main objective of being deployed to serve in council. We have it on good authority that the fighting and polarisation in this council emanates, primarily, from the subsistence and travel allowances. This is an indictment of what the national democratic revolution is about if not a spit in the face of the electorate," Zondi said.Spokesperson of the ANC in the Greater KwaDukuza region, Lucky Makhathini said that there is no truth in the allegation that some of the organisation s councillors in the iLembe District Municipality are causing a "polarisation of councillors in the iLembe District Municipality" because they can no longer claim for travel allowances.He said it would be difficult to say that some councillors do not attend some meetings because they have an issue about claims for travel allowances being suspended because none of the councillors that have missed meetings before never gave this as a reason. Even full-time councillors miss meetings and they would provide reasons or apologies for doing so, he said.Makhathini said some of the ANC councillors did raise the matter at an ANC caucus meeting and that the organisation is looking into the matter to try and find innovative ways to deal with the matter amicably.He said the ANC has met with the iLembe Municipality leadership, and that the organisation is yet to meet with the department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) in order to engage further on this matter. The ANC understands that its councillors have been deployed to serve the community yet as the organisation we understand as well that it is difficult for councillors to fulfil this mandate without the necessary resources, he said.However, iLembe District Municipality manager of communications Zee Nqala said to her knowledge the municipality has received no complaints and the allowances are being paid.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
