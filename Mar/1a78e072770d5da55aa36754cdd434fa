Existing state institutions, such as the SA Post Office, should be used to carry out such functions in future, he said.'Dodging Dlamini'The DA meanwhile called for a full parliamentary enquiry into "dodging Dlamini".DA MPs Bridget Masango and David Ross said Dlamini had once again dodged accountability before Scopa. She failed to adequately account for the social grant crisis and even tried to make an early exit during her appearance on Tuesday."Dodging accountability has now become the hallmark of the ANC and comes straight from the top as just yesterday President [Jacob] Zuma instructed officials to stop answering questions on Sassa."They wanted answers on the terms of the SA Social Security Agency&rsquo;s (Sassa) new contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS), the new cost, and about the resignation on Saturday of social development department director general Zane Dangor.The DA had submitted an application to the Constitutional Court asking it to confirm that Dlamini and Sassa violated their duties. The party would hold a march to Dlamini's office on Friday.'Daylight robbery'The UDM said South Africans must not be blinded by the "self-created crisis" by the most "uncaring and reckless administration we have had since the dawn of democracy"."The fact that the negotiations with CPS are not concluded speaks volumes," UDM MP Mncedisi Filtane said.It was unacceptable that Gordhan and Dlamini could not resolve their differences over the matter."The fact that President Zuma&rsquo;s ministers are not working together, to find a proper and legally correct solution to the problem, is a display of arrogance and a sign of a government without regard for the most vulnerable members of our society."Filtane said the public wanted full disclosure on CPS's mobile services and deductions from grants. It was "one of the biggest daylight robbery acts," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
