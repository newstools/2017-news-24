The Post Office would propose a six-month transition period.Granting the contract to the Post Office, an organ of state, would &ldquo;be of benefit to the citizens of the country&rdquo; as a costs-saving to the fiscus.Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has said she is not opposed to Post Office involvement in the payment system, but that CPS objected. MPs have accused her of favouring CPS over the Post Office.Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza has said the problem is that the Post Office has only 2 567 outlets, mostly in peri-urban areas, while the current system offers 10 000 outlets, mostly in rural areas.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
