Their last meeting was this past Friday," Zulu said.KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said the blocked road had since been cleared and the crowd had been dispersed.Empangeni public order police and Eshowe officers were still in the area monitoring the situation.No arrests were made, said Zwane. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
