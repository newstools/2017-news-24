Its main purpose was to ensure the dignity of the party and to anchor its values.Mbekwa said the chaplaincy was unhappy over the way the SA Social Security Agency had handled the grants contract issue and created unnecessary panic.However, on Monday, Mbekwa was full of praise for Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini. He called on God to protect her from her enemies."We spray the blood of Jesus over this minister! She is the child of God. She deserves the best," he said.Dlamini&rsquo;s ministry oversees Sassa, which has failed to find a new contractor to pay social grants after Cash Paymaster Services' invalid contract ends on March 31.He had harsh words though for the DA, blaming the party and Western Cape Premier Helen Zille for inequality and racism in the province.He called on the DA to implement anti-inequality policies and to get internal problems under control for the sake of stability.The DA ousted the ANC to take control of the Western Cape in 2011.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
