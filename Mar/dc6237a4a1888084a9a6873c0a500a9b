Tammy Petersen, News24Pretoria &ndash; Meetings will be missed and thousands will be late for work, but not all motorists are balling their fists at the truck driver blockade that brought Pretoria to a standstill on Wednesday.Some slammed the truckers who caused chaos in the capital as inconsiderate, while others hailed it as a genius way to draw attention to their cause."It's inconvenient for everyone else traveling to Pretoria. But let's acknowledge the fact that it's peaceful," tweeted @smitj2.Tshwane Metro Police senior superintendent Isaac Mahamba confirmed that there have been no incidents of violence, although he said the blockading of the major routes itself was illegal."I honestly feel like they are doing what they can to protect themselves! They wouldn't be heard any other way #TruckStrike," said @tlatsi_kgaphola."Those stuck in the #TruckStrike your gonna spend the day on the road I'm afraid, but it's for a good cause," said Twitter user @bubu_pearl.'Confiscate every truck'"Even if it takes me 2 hours to get to work. I fully support the drivers. We can't afford more job losses#TruckStrike" agreed user @giveawayxexa.However, other motorists were not so understanding."Why don't these truck drivers go block the entrances to Eskom's power stations instead of screwing the average Joe again? #TruckStrike," asked @nicbc123.@shaunodendaal argued there are "better and more legitimate ways to raise a grievance than blockading a highway"."Confiscate every truck involved, liquidate the companies, and give the drivers a damn good thrashing #TruckStrike."Fin24 on Wednesday reported that coal trucks blocked routes in protest of renewable energy projects.The Coal Transport Forum reportedly said that Eskom&rsquo;s agreement with Independent Power Producers (IPPs) will see mining job losses.The move towards IPPs has seemingly irked the likes of coal transporters, who on Wednesday morning said they are leading a convoy to the Union Buildings to voice their grievances to President Jacob Zuma.#TruckStrike Trucks moving at snails pace through Pretoria CBD.
