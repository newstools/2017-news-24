Rights group AfriForum gathered statistics based on news reports and accounts forwarded to its research desk.In a previous attempt at establishing a fuller picture of attacks, an AfriForum researcher explained that, because updated crime statistics were not available, they relied on newspaper reports for their statistics. Other victims, such as labourers assaulted to gain access to a farm, were often overlooked in reports and so were not accounted for in their research."The murders and attacks are a tragedy," Groenewald said."The FF Plus, therefore, welcomes this historical debate. It is of the greatest importance that the public of South Africa knows what political parties do about issues that affect everybody in the country."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
