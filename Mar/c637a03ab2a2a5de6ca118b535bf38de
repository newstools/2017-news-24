They accused the men of passing information to the military," he added, asking not to be identified."The gunmen took the men outside the village where they slaughtered three of the men."Long-time Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq in March 2015, at a time when it was losing captured territory to government forces.But last year ISIS announced that it recognised Barnawi - the son of Boko Haram's founder Mohammed Yusuf - as being in charge of its "West Africa province".Barnawi has criticised Shekau's indiscriminate attacks on civilians.The security sources said the gunmen seized livestock from the nearby village of Dekete but "told the villagers not to panic, that they were not going to touch anyone".Fighters from the Barnawi camp employed a similar tactic on Friday, when they raided a village for food and medical supplies southwest of the Borno state capital, Maiduguri.Analysts suggest that in doing so, he may be trying to bolster public support for the group, which if successful would make the government and military fightback harder.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
