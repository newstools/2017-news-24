Judge Elize Steyn said during Delvigo Ward's pre-trial hearing that the trial would take place on May 8 in Swellendam. The 20-year-old appeared in good condition in the dock, with his toned arms exposed in his cut-off vest, which had the word 'Skat' printed on it. He is accused of killing 22-year-old Sulnita Manho in April 2016. Manho's body was found at the lime works in the rural Overberg town early on a weekend morning. She had apparently been at a local pub with friends when a man offered to walk her back to the farm she was staying, outside Bredasdorp, said Napier Community Police Forum member and councillor Evelyn Sauls at the time. "There was a rope on her neck. She was raped and a bottle was put in her private parts. The person took a brick and hit her on the head," Sauls said.Ward had previously undergone mental observation to determine if he was fit to stand trial.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
