He also called on South Africans to "cool down" over the saga.Zuma was speaking at the Union Buildings following his presidential co-ordinating council meeting with ministers, premiers and some local government officials.He told journalists that he had instructed the two ministers involved in the matter to ensure that money is secured for the payments to go through."Nothing says it should not happen. If that is the case, then you will realise what will happen, what we'll do to those who were supposed to do it," said Zuma."Cool down as a country, old people will get their grants, absolutely," said Zuma. &nbsp;Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini, has to explain to the Constitutional Court why her department failed to act on a previous order it handed down in 2014.The court found that the contract the South African Social Services Agency had with Cash Paymaster Services was invalid and unconstitutional. The contract expires at the end of March, but no other service provider has been secured to take over the task.Zuma also said that tensions between South Africans and immigrants had been discussed.Regarding the recent xenophobic violence in the country, the president questioned why it was labelled xenophobia in South Africa, but in Europe it was called something else."It's a fact Europeans do not want Africans, they are closing their borders. Why are we not calling xenophobia, but it's called something else," questioned Zuma.''It's like corruption. When it's black, it's termed corruption, but when it's white or business it's called collusion," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
