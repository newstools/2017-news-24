A bakkie full of men started stoning the taxi. The driver quickly stopped and told us to all jump [out]. We were only three left. We jumped [out], and they chased the taxi away. Since then, I have been scared to take a taxi again," she said.Students affectedMalgas said she and her other colleagues had a contract with the taxi, which was part of Bata, and wished the taxi violence would end.Other people affected by the closure of taxi ranks are students who study in Mthatha.Lulama Njani from Ngqeleni told GroundUp she had to hire a small car to take her two children to school until school closes on Friday.She had to borrow R400 from a neighbour to pay for her children&rsquo;s transport."We are happy that the MEC is doing something to solve the taxi violence, but we are really struggling a lot," she said."Most people rely on hitchhiking; you can see how they rush, pushing each other just to find transport to work," she said.Priscilla Shozi from Lusikisiki, who studies in East London, said she was worried that she would not be able to go home next week if taxi ranks were not reopened.'I must forget about going home'Usually, she takes a taxi from East London to Mthatha, then another taxi from Mthatha to Lusikisiki."There&rsquo;s no other way to Lusikisiki; we have to pass Mthatha. If there are no taxis, then I must forget about going home," she said.Spokesperson for the Usta OR Tambo branch, Bishop Zola Yolelo, said the two associations had met last week Friday and were in talks about ending the violence.Eastern Cape SAPS commissioner Liziwe Ntshinga commended the police for the arrests of the seven men."We will continue to put the safety of commuters first and intolerance and violence will not be allowed," she said.Ntshinga said the task team on taxi violence had been provided with additional resources from the National Intervention Unit, Public Order Policing, and detectives and intelligence officers. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
