The ANC lost control of Tshwane, the City of Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela Bay in the polls.Galo said there would be another meeting between the two political parties on March 15.Ultimatum remains"We are going to sign an MOU with deadlines as to when the legislative process will kick in," said Galo. He said the processes would ensure Matatiele's incorporation back into KwaZulu-Natal.The AIC was formed in protest against the demarcation of the area into the Eastern Cape."We are not talking about all nine provinces; just two provinces will be affected. Our MOU will have deadlines as to when the legislative processes around this will kick in," added Galo.The AIC president also said his party was happy dealing with the ANC's Jeff Radebe."He has shown that they are taking this Matatiele matter seriously," he said.Although the AIC said it was confident that talks between the two parties would be successful, Galo said its ultimatum remained in place. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
