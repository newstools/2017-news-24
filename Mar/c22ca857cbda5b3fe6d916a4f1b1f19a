"It's not science. It's basically trying to reach an estimation of what the harm has been in relation to the crimes."If Katanga cannot himself pay any reparations awarded then the TFV could decide to dip into its funds, gathered from voluntary contributions from member states.But it only has $5 million available, of which one million has been set aside for the case of Thomas Lubanga. And under its guidelines, it can only help pay collective reparations not any individual ones.Reconciliation&nbsp;The case of Lubanga, another Congolese warlord sentenced in 2012 to 14 years for conscripting child soldiers in the DRC, was the first to see some kind of ICC compensation awarded.In October, judges approved "symbolic reparations" to create a "living memorial" to remember and raise awareness about child soldiers.But a final decision on collective reparations for Lubanga's victims is still awaited.The Ituri region where the Bogoro massacre occurred has been riven by violence since 1999, when clashes broke out that killed at least 60 000 people, according to rights groups.Aid workers say they hope any reparations will go towards long-term projects such as building roads, health centres and schools."Given that today the victims and the executioners are living together, we must help people reach a real reconciliation," said Jean Bosco Lalo, coordinator for the local group, the Ituri Civil Society.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
