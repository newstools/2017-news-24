UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres last week asked the Security Council to send an extra 320 UN police to the country after a deal to end a dispute over the presidential election stalled.The so-called Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of Congo is made up of six people and provides annual reports on the situation in the country, notably on the movement of illegal arms. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
