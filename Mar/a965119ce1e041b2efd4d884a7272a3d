A preservation order was granted to the AFU on Tuesday.Tsepo Ndwalaza, regional&nbsp;NPA spokesperson, said the black C 320 CDI automatic AMG Mercedes Benz and carport were allegedly kickbacks Tantsi had received in connection&nbsp;with a R10m tender issued by the Mnquma municipality two years ago.Tantsi was arrested along with Butterworth businessman Sive Nombembe on February 14 on charges of corruption relating to a plastic bag tender awarded to Nombembe's business, Big Event Boy (Pty) Ltd."In order to make sure that the tender was not cancelled, Nombembe bought the Mercedes Benz from Noor Auto, Durban, and had it delivered to Tantsi and paid Hide 'n Shade CC of Kokstad for the construction of the carport at Mr Tantsi's homestead at Chibini Village, Ntabankulu," said Ndwalaza."These are deemed as gratification in the Corruption Act and are liable to forfeiture to the State," he said. Ndwalaza said the Mercedes Benz was purchased in October 2015 and had an estimated value of R202 949; the carport was constructed for R35 000."Tantsi and Nombembe will be served with the preservation order and be given an opportunity to oppose the granting of a forfeiture order against the kickbacks. Should they fail [to do so] the kickback will be forfeited to the State and the proceeds thereof be used to bolster law enforcement," said Ndwalaza.Tantsi and Nombembe are scheduled to re-appear on March 27 in the Mthatha Magistrate's Court. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
