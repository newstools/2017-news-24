THE recent broadcast by Carte Blanche of professional nurses asleep during their tour of duty is unacceptable, disgusting and contrary to their humanitarian calling.I have been informed by unconfirmed sources that this practice is common in many hospitals. The welfare and wellbeing of patients are at risk. This is tantamount to neglect of duty and the necessary departmental disciplinary procedures should be instituted.I urge the relevant hospital authorities and hospital boards to install CCTV surveillance equipment at strategic locations to obviate neglect of duty. According to the nurses pledge, the total health of patients should be the nurses first consideration. However, this appears not to be the case.Hospital authorities are urged to take the necessary measures to remove this malpractice.LOGAN GOVENDER24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
