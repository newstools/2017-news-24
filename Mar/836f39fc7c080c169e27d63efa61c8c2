This is especially vital in DRC, which ranks near the bottom of the UN Human Development Index and has one of the lowest rates of GDP (gross domestic product) per capita in the world."Joseph Kabila took power following his father's assassination in 2001. He has faced unprecedented pressure to stand down in recent months after his term expired in December.As political tensions soared, he struck a power-sharing deal with the opposition on New Year's Eve that provides for elections late this year. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
