Charlotte van Fowler, a South African who has been living in London since 2002, said when she received a message on her phone about the unfolding incident, she immediately thought of the attack on the French magazine Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, in which 12 people died.Van Fowler is a manager at a cleaning company in Trafalgar Square, which is about 1km from where the attack took place. She said she locked the store and informed staff after she'd received the message. They were shocked, she said. "It could have been worse," she said. "We have a lot to be grateful for."However, she was "shocked" that the attack had been possible, given the strong police presence in the area. She added that she'd attended several courses on what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
