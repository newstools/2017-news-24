Enoch Dongo, secretary general of the Zimbabwe Nurses Association, said on Wednesday that nurses will only return to work when they get a firm commitment that their bonuses will be paid. Nurses and other government workers have yet to be paid a traditional annual bonus. The financially struggling government has proposed offsetting the 2016 bonus payments with land offers. Dongo, however, says nurses want the bonuses in cash, not land. State hospital doctors have been on strike since February 15, forcing the government to send in army and police doctors to care for patients. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
