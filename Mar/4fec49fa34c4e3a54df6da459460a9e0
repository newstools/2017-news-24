She is alleged to have sent him Whatsapp messages asking him to reveal "information about state security" and "to go to Uganda to form an armed group to attack Rwanda".Shumbusho confessed to the charge in court on Thursday while Uwamahoro slammed it as a lie."Yes we used to chat but I didn't talk to him about anything to do with national security. We only discussed family matters. It is a lie."Uwamahoro is the wife of Faustin Rukundo, an official with the exiled Rwandan National Congress (RNC) which was formed by former allies of President Paul Kagame. Kigali has qualified the group as "terrorist".Kagame is seeking re-election in August after the country's constitution was changed in 2015, allowing him to seek a third seven-year term. He has been a main player in the small east African country since 1994 when his forces stopped a Hutu genocide against his Tutsi minority which left some 800 000 dead.After serving as vice president he was appointed by parliament as president in 2000 and then won presidential elections in 2003.While Kagame is regularly praised for the stability and economic performance of his small nation, Kagame is also often criticised by rights groups for lack of political freedoms and freedom of expression.Rwanda is constitutionally a multi-party system but there is only one registered opposition party.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
