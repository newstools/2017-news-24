The crisis is self-made and it seems clear to us as NUMSA that this was intentional," Jim said.Ben Theron, portfolio director for civil organisation OUTA, called Dlamini&rsquo;s briefing on Sunday "nothing short of a disgrace"."We expected the minister to share the status of negotiations, the costs and the process to transfer of responsibility from the contractor to the in-house disbursement management team," Theron said. &nbsp;"Instead, double-speak and denial was the order of the day, with no clarity about the sudden resignation of Mr Dangor, her Director General, or the absence of the Sassa CEO at the briefing," Theron said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
