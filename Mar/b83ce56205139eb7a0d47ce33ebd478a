He represented everything that was good about ANC.Phosa said every ANC cadre should commit to memory Kathrada's 2016 letter to Zuma to resign."A president is one that must at all times unite this country behind a vision and programme that seeks to make tomorrow a better day than today for all South Africans. It is a position that requires the respect of all South Africans, which of course must be earned at all times," Kathrada wrote. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
