Five people were injured when a roof collapsed at the Charlotte Maxeke Academic hospital, but the rest of the hospital's operations were not affected. Jump to bottom Mec Ramkgopa confirms that there are no fatalities#CharlotteMaxekeInfrastructure MEC Jacob Mamobolo says the contractor is Thanzanani enterprises, they are in charge of infrastructure in GP #CharlotteMaxekePremier David Makhura said their immediate concern was to check injured patients, two of them had been discharged. Focus now is on the contractor. Department of labour inspectors are present and will provide a report. Aaron Motsoaledi says the contractors had removed concrete from an are and decided to place it in an area where they weren't working. That area had a thin 'layer of sorts' and the weight of that concrete is what resulted in the collapse.MEC Jacob Mamabolo said it doesn t appear that safety signs were put up to alert people that construction work was being conducted. The contractor must be held accountable as they didn t use safety measures. The contactors will be removed from the site with immediate effect and taken to task.

We want to know from the MEC of Infrastructure and Development, what is the name of the company that is doing the work, Mashego said. We also want to know, as a matter of urgency, if it s an outright accident. She added that the EFF has been receiving numerous complaints from the medical profession, particularly Charlotte Maxeke Hospital. It s a coincidence that this happens now, because during this week we ve been receiving a lot of worrying calls from the medical profession, particularly at this hospital. We are planning to hone in specifically at health and this specific hospital. We have a special interest in this hospital we are going to keep a close eye on the issue, Mashego said.Premier at #CharlotteMaxeke following structural collapse, no fatalities reported, some injuries, cause of the collapse under investigation pic.twitter.com/7sXM3yCidcPremier Makhura @GautengHealth MEC @GwenRamokgopa and @GPDID MEC @JacobMamaboloSA at #CharlotteMaxeke Academic Hospital pic.twitter.com/snyDnfCoDFER24 s Russel Meiring told News24 that there are approximately 20-30 staff and teams trying to work through the rubble at Charlotte Maxeka&nbsp; Hospital.
