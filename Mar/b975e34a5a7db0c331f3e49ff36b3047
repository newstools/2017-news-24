CE pic.twitter.com/Bl1yz7ARRTER24 spokesperson Annine Dormehl told News24 that roughly 6 people were stuck in the rubble when they arrived on scene. She could not confirm the injuries at this time. Gauteng EMS CEO, Arnold Malotana said that the roof was being sealed when it collapsed. They were actually working on the roof. They were sealing the roof when the roof collapsed. They were doing it in phases, so they ll seal one area and move rubble in one area. In that process, when they were working over an hour ago, one part of the roof collapsed. It is estimated that at the time of the collapse there were about 10/12 people working in the area. So far about 4 people have already been taken to casualty with minor injuries. So we still need to account for the missing number and we are waiting for the contractor and the foreman to account for those numbers.&nbsp;We are getting closer to the number, where the biggest rubble is. The first puddle we have searched, we did not find anyone so we are satisfied with that. There are two more areas we still need to search, He said an update on the number of injuries will be provided.Staff told @JackBloomDA that stones were moved onto the section of the roof which collapse onto the hospital street level. #CharlotteMaxekeER24 spokesperson Annine Dormehl told @News24 that roughly 6 people were stuck in the rubble when they arrived Charlotte Maxeke Hospital.R50 million worth of urgent repair was, according to Bloom, needed for structural defects on the building s fifth floor. &nbsp; In a report in 2012, Section 27 highlighted the urgent need for infrastructure repairs at Gauteng hospitals. &nbsp; In many hospitals the buildings and infrastructure have not been maintained, it said. &nbsp; Wards are in a poor condition and are sometimes dangerous (for example, medicine storage rooms without burglar bars; a temporary psychiatric ward in which male and female patients are separated only by cubicles). Passages are often potholed. Doctors' quarters are often decrepit and uncomfortable. Various hospitals in Johannesburg have lifts that are often non-functional. Bloom had previously raised concerns about the hospital.In October 2016 Bloom sent out a press release about issues he had picked up.He had said there were two buckets to collect water that leaks from broken ceiling panels on the hospital street level .In the release, he had said there were leaks in various rooms at a ward in the paediatric clinic and a consultation room was used for storage because of faeces that leaked into it from the ceiling last year. Last year, surgery had to be stopped in one of the theatres because of leaking water. Large ceiling panels are missing at Ward 348 Radiation Oncology, with a huge bucket placed underneath to collect water, it said. There are also leaks in other parts of the hospital and in the parking garages. Sewage is sometimes mixed in as well, causing a foul smell. Bloom had at the time said: I am concerned that structural defects at the hospital are causing the leaks, which management has done little to fix despite many staff complaints. In 2012 there was a report on structural defects at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital that warned that the X-ray department should be evacuated as it could collapse. Concerns about the structural safety at the Charlotte Maxeke Hospital, where a section of the roof collapsed on Thursday afternoon, were previously highlighted by DA provincial legislature member Jack Bloom.Emergency services are going through rubble to see if people are stuck.In 2012, Section 27 highlighted the urgent need for infrastructure repairs at Gauteng hospitals including Charlotte Maxeke Hospital @News24He says that EMS has already gone through one part and are searching in the other part.#CharlotteMaxekeMolostane says that 10-12 people were working. when it collapsed and 4 people have been taken to casualty. #CharlotteMaxekeJohannesburg EMS spokesperson Nana Radebe said one person has been removed from the rubble after a roof collapsed at Charlotte Maxeke Hospital on Thursday.Emergency services are currently going rough the rubble to see if any other person is stuck.

SM pic.twitter.com/rzN668foSXA hospital worker told a News24 reporter that the problem has to do with water seepage. The issue was raised previously - whenever it rains the water seeps from the 9th floor to the 5th floor and they have to clean it up.
