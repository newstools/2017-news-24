 AT the moment, there is no community policing forum in Marburg, but together with the SAPS, we are looking at re-establishing one, said Rajaram.He added that he has received several reports from residents of prostitution and with the help of law enforcement and the SAPS, the issue will be tackled. It is not right that residents live in fear. Prostitution, drugs and crime go together and this is what residents are afraid of. He said that once the Businesses Against Crime forum and the Community Policing Forum have been revived, the problem of prostitution will be prioritised.Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Zandra Wiid said the SAPS is aware of prostitution in Marburg. We have conducted several operations where we have arrested 17 people for prostitution as well as seven for drug-related offences from January to date, she said.Only one house-breaking case and a common assault case were reported in the Wimpy Crescent area. The Port Shepstone station management has changed its strategy and will from now on also target customers in prostitution activities as they are the main reason why prostitution is still rife in the area, she said. We realise that prostitution can also contribute to higher drug activity and crimes being committed in the area, which is why we will concentrate on the customers as well, said Wiid.Anyone with information can contact the police at 10111.CONTINUED FROM PAGE 124.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
