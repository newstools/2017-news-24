	     Johannesburg - A Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department
officer is in ICU in hospital after he was shot while conducting a stop and
search roadblock in Ivory Park on Monday.  MMC for Public Safety Michael Sun said on Tuesday that two JMPD
officers were conducting a roadblock on Freedom Drive in Ivory Park Extension 2
at around 12:20 when they pulled over a suspicious looking white bakkie. "Four male occupants exited the vehicle and one gunman
fired his R5-automatic rifle at the officers,” Sun said.    The officers returned fire with their 9mm service pistols
and during the exchange, one of the officers was shot in the arm and leg.   The suspects fled the scene and the vehicle was later
recovered at Tembisa Hostel. No arrests have been made, he said. During further investigations, it was revealed that the
suspects had also robbed a business near the vicinity where the officers were
conducting their operation. “This is the second incident during the past month where
gunmen opened fire on JMPD officers with R5-automatic rifles. It is cause for
concern that criminals in the city are so heavily armed,” Sun said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
