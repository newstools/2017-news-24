The court had sent Dlamini and the grants agency a set of stern questions on March 8. They were given a deadline of Monday 16:00 to make the submission.Dlamini and Sassa failed to meet the deadline to answer the court's questions about when Sassa knew it would not be able to take over the grants payments, when its contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) expires on March 31. The court also wanted to know which officials were aware of this.The department instead filed heads of arguments on Monday and a proposed draft order but did not file affidavits expected to indicate who should be liable for the crisis. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
