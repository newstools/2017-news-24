They were given a deadline of Monday 16:00 to make the submission, which Dlamini and Sassa failed to meet.&nbsp;The department instead filed heads of arguments on Monday and a proposed draft order.&nbsp;Magasela said in his affidavit on Tuesday that during the four days he was acting CEO when current CEO Thokozani Magwaza was sick, and on Monday, he also "made every reasonable effort to comply with this court's directions".&nbsp;"I believe that minister did as well... I know she did depose an affidavit yesterday dealing with the matters set out in the [initial] directions."#Sassa Papers have been filed, we just aren't sure what the contents are.
