"We have seen an increase in cases of malaria in recent years explained by progress in our screening programme and in our community treatment projects," said Lorna Gurjal, the head of the health ministry's epidemiology department. The number of deaths and serious cases are however decreasing, she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
