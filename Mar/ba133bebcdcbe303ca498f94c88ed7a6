It led to racial tensions, as well as staff and student complaints.The SCA held that this was a good reason to depart from the existing policy. &nbsp;The High Court had held that, in adopting the new policy, the UFS had failed to consider the Constitution and the 2002 Higher Education Language Policy (LPHE).The Constitution guarantees language of choice in public education institutions when "reasonably practicable", while the Higher Education Language Policy advocates the retention and strengthening of Afrikaans at historically Afrikaans universities, such as UFS.The SCA held that the evidence showed that UFS had indeed considered both when taking the decision for the new language policy.The judgment reads that there was no basis for the argument by AfriForum and Solidarity that the UFS had misconstrued its powers when it adopted the new policy.The SCA held that AfriForum was not liable to pay for the UFS&rsquo;s costs because its real purpose was to vindicate the constitutional rights of Afrikaans-language speakers.However, Solidarity, as a trade union had not shown that it had a legal interest in these proceedings and was, therefore, liable for UFS&rsquo;s costs.The judges also ordered that certain parts of the respondents&rsquo; (AfriForum and Solidarity) papers be struck out.The matter was before Justices Kevin Swain, Rami Mathopo, Burton Fourie and Ashton Schippers. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
