They had drowned, apparently in the 24 hours prior to them being discovered shortly after dawn on Thursday in waters directly north of the Libyan port of Sabrata.Despite rough winter seas, migrant departures from Libya on boats chartered by people traffickers have accelerated in recent months from already-record levels.Over 5 000 people have been picked up by rescue boats since Sunday, bringing the number brought to Italy since the start of 2017 to over 21 000, a sharp rise on the same period in previous years.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
