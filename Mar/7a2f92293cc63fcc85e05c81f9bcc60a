But these incidents are not included in the IOM's estimates, in particular as one of the vessels may have been one that capsized in Libyan waters shortly before then, in which 54 people were rescued but 66 were missing.The dangers have not slowed the surge in arrivals this year, however: The Italian coastguard says it orchestrated the rescue of more than 1 100 migrants off Libya between Tuesday and Wednesday morning.The coastguard is taking them to Sicily, which will bring the total number of arrivals to Italy this year to more than 24 000, a sharp increase from the same period last year.Nongovernmental organisations say the increase reflects worsening living conditions in Libya as well as fears, whipped up by smugglers, that Europe will soon block off the Mediterranean passage for good.Italy has been trying to bolster its cooperation with Libya to halt the people-smuggling operations by building camps to house migrants who are intercepted trying to reach Europe, and send them back to their countries.The plan has riled rights groups, who see the potential for abuse in Libya and note that 40% of sub-Saharan migrants who apply for asylum in Italy are currently being accepted. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
