This comes as SAPS revealed that 706 police officials had been arrested for criminal activity in the 2016/17 financial year, compared to 725 in 2015/16.&nbsp;In a statement, acting national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane's&nbsp;spokesperson, Athlenda Mathe, said the officials threatened Lesotho nationals who did not have the correct documentation.&nbsp;In some instances, they assisted these nationals to cross the border without the correct documentation required, Mathe said.&nbsp;A joint operation with the Hawks, at the Ficksburg port of entry into Lesotho and SA, led to their arrests.&nbsp;"During the duration of the investigation, officials were observed and it then became evident that our own were implicated," she said.Phahlane welcomed the arrests.&nbsp;"The arrest of our own is both disheartening and pleasing at the same time because this gives us an opportunity to identify the corrupt elements within the system," he said.&nbsp;"Other members should draw lessons from this, and this should serve as a deterrence within our organisation to those officials who may be involved in corrupt-related activities." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
