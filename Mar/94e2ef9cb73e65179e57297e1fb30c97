It also wanted a warrant to seize additional goods belonging to the accused. Wessels said the alleged incidents had happened in 2014 and 2015.He contended that the police had obtained a warrant on Friday last week and that the house of the accused had already been searched and all relevant items confiscated. Wessels said the woman would be staying with her mother for the duration of the case.Race cardChief Magistrate Steven Hinana agreed with Wessels that an extra seven days would be unnecessary, but contended that the accused had to be treated in the same way as any other bail applicant.&nbsp; Hinana said he wouldn't allow "that, because she is white, she will get preferential treatment to bring an urgent application".&nbsp; In reply, Wessels said his practice had never been guilty of doing that, and all clients were treated equally.&nbsp; He also expressed his displeasure at Hinana's comment, saying it was regrettable that the magistrate had played the "race card" in court.Hinana then recused himself and the case was postponed to Tuesday, when a new magistrate would preside over the matter. The woman was remanded and will appear in court again on Tuesday.The teacher's family, who had travelled from the Western Cape to support her, was in court during proceedings, as were the parents of the minor.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
