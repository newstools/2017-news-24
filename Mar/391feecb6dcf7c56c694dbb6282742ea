The $5 million grant, released through its Central Emergency Response Fund, will be for a maximum period of six months to save the lives of about 108 000 people."The majority of the affected population is still sheltering in places often located in the bush," OCHA said. "These displaced people have no access to drinking water, nor to basic food or health services." The UN organisation added that the insecurity that continues to plague the province has forced many schools to close, "depriving some 53,000 students of normal schooling" this year. Kasai is a particularly isolated and under-developed region in DRC.Clashes between government forces and Nsapu supporters, which began in the central Kasai. have steadily also engulfed the east and west areas of Kasai.In February, a seven-minute video posted to social media, which appeared to be taken by a cellphone, purported to show a massacre of unarmed men and women by Congolese soldiers apparently in the central Kasai area.The government first qualified the video as a "ridiculous montage," rejecting international pressure to investigate. But two days later, it did an about-face, saying it was looking into the video "as a precautionary measure".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
