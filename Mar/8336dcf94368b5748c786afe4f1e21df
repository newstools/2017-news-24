They also agreed to suspend the sentences for Mangenda and Kilolo for three years.Bemba however, did not qualify for a reduction of sentence and will serve the one year "consecutively" to the 18 years already handed to him by the court based in The Hague.He was also ordered to pay a $323 640 fine "within three months" - with the money to be transferred into the ICC's Trust Fund for Victims, which helps rehabilitate victims and affected communities.Handing down the sentence, Judge Schmitt said judges "are of the opinion that there is a need to discourage this sort of behaviour and to prevent it from happening again."The sentences are however lighter than asked for by prosecutors, who wanted eight years for Bemba and Kilolo, seven for Mangenda, five for Arido and three for Babala.The feared former rebel leader and his four associates were found guilty in October of bribing witnesses in what judges at the world war crimes court described as "clear and downright criminal behaviour".The bribery verdict was the first of its kind in the ICC's history, and the charges were brought after a tip-off to the prosecutor's office.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
