He told ANCYL delegates at the league's provincial elective conference in Durban how "izimpimpi" were dealt with during the anti-apartheid struggle. Maine questioned who Gordhan was representing.Pre-1994, izimpimpi were "necklaced" for their betrayal of the struggle. This method of execution involved putting a petrol-soaked tyre over the victim&rsquo;s head and setting it alight.The ACM and JAI called on political leaders to ensure their followers behaved in a dignified and disciplined manner. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
