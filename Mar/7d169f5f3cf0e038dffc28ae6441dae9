I offered an explanation that convinced him, but he asked me to write a letter of apology", the journalist said."Under threat, I accepted."Ngadjadoum was eventually freed without charge.For 27 years, Deby has ruled Chad with an iron fist. The nation is a key ally of the West in the fight against jihadists.RSF lists Chad as the 127th nation out of 179 in its World Press Freedom Index, and describes the country as a "tough" place to be a journalist."Despite laws protecting media freedom, any criticism of the regime or its allies is immediately punished," the watchdog says on its website.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
