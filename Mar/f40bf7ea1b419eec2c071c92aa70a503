It would take a year for the decision to come into effect.The decision followed several court judgments that the government had violated the law by not arresting Al-Bashir during his visit to SA for an African Union summit in June 2016.The ICC had issued warrants for his arrest and wanted him to stand trial on charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
