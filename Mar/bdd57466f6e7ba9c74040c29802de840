Every time it got stuck behind a pile of rocks on a ledge at a depth of 60m.Mines Rescue Services CEO Christo de Klerk said the shaft had been covered with a cement slab, which collapsed during heavy rain.De Klerk said that at a depth of 36m, the oxygen level in the air was at 11%. Air contains about 21% oxygen."I want to make it very clear that no person alive can survive at the level of oxygen," De Klerk said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
