The most affected regions of the country are in the south where floods cut off access to health clinics.Heavy rains battered the southern African country from December until the end of February, leaving 246 people dead and at least 2 000 people homeless across the country while homes and schools were damaged and several dams burst.The government has issued an international appeal for aid.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
