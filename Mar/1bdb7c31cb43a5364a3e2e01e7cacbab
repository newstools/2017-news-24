The bomb, carried by a man on foot, exploded near a police checkpoint monitoring vehicles heading to the Hazrat Shahjahal International Airport. "The bomb carrier himself was killed," said a Dhaka police spokesperson, Yusuf Ali. He did not say whether the attack had specifically targeted the checkpoint. The suspected attack was the third since last Friday, when a suicide bomber blew himself up at a camp for the country's elite security force near the airport. The attacker was killed and two members of the Rapid Action Battalion, tasked with combating Islamist militancy, were injured. The Islamic State group claimed the attack. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
