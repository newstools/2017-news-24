Watch.WATCHCape Town &ndash; The ANC on Friday neither welcomed nor condemned President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s Cabinet reshuffle. Instead, the party called for its members to display unity.The ANC&rsquo;s national officials had expressed varying opinions about Zuma&rsquo;s changes, spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa told reporters on Friday morning that he had raised his "concern and objection" with Zuma about his removal of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, because the decision was based on a dubious intelligence report. He said claims in the report that Gordhan was mobilising overseas investors to push for regime change were "totally unacceptable"."The ANC is confident that the national officials of the ANC will meet soon to further appraise each other on this matter and collectively give guidance and leadership to the organisation," Kodwa said.He said South Africans had bestowed upon the ANC the leadership responsibility to make a success of the country.'Robust engagement'This required committed and focused action from ANC members and leaders, Kodwa said in the carefully worded statement."The ANC, therefore, at all times should focus on common and national challenges in the interest of the people and to advance their aspirations."From time to time, he continued, there might be different views on the nature and means to achieve the type of society they wanted.&nbsp;"Diversity and plurality of views do not mean division, but robust and necessary engagement within our movement in our quest to deliver on our responsibility to our people."He said members and leaders of the ANC were expected to focus on what unified, rather than what divided them."Members of the executive are as always expected to display the highest levels of integrity, selflessness, trustworthiness, honesty and commitment to serve our people in the execution of their duties."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
