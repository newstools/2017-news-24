She said the system inherited in 1994 was &ldquo;inhumane&rdquo;, but Sassa had changed that.She said they were confident that the contract issues would be sorted out soon.&ldquo;As a responsible citizen I call upon all of us in Parliament and elsewhere to calm down and allow the national government to do its work and continue to deliver this vital service to the people of South Africa.&rdquo;Another ANC Western Cape MPL, Maurencia Gillion, took a dig at the DA, which had applied unsuccessfully to join next week's Constitutional Court application to get clarity over who would distribute the grants.&ldquo;If The DA cared, its members would now all be working really hard in warehouses and stores to make up 17 million grocery hampers to distribute before April 1 to those poor people who get state grants,&rdquo; she said.The Department of Social Development came clean earlier this year over its inability to take over the grants payments system from Cash Paymaster Services when its invalid contract ends on March 31.CPS is expected to carry on with a new contract until the department is ready to take over the task. Questions have been raised over how it was able to get the deal without the usual onerous tender processes. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
