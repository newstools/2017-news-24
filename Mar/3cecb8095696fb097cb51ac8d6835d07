This is the biggest jackpot since the game s inception 17 years ago. The winner s bank account is R26, 550, 301, net worth. She carefully selected six winning numbers and purchased the ticket for R15. She told the Ithuba National Lottery that she and her husband usually spent R500 monthly on Lotto and Lotto Plus tickets. This jackpot was her first winnings ever. Very emotional she described how she discovered that she was the jackpot winner. I found out about the winning ticket while standing in my kitchen and checking the numbers from a text message on my phone. When I got to the third correct number, I just started screaming, shaking and spinning around. I was unbelievably excited. I phoned my husband, but he couldn t believe it either. He said that I should make sure first. I then phoned the Ithuba office, who confirmed my win. The winner plans to invest most of the money to prepare for retirement. She would also like to take her husband on a tour to Namibia and Malawi.The couple has received financial advice, as well as psychological and emotional counselling. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
