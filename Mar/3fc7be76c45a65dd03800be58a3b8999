Africa is for all Africans," Meyer said."It's unfair to our brothers and sisters who have to go through this. It's our home, this is us. It's our own people who are oppressing them."She said the country needs to get rid of the problem by providing education on the matter, speaking to young people, talking to churches and to mosques and to "go all over and everywhere"."We cannot have people bullying our brothers and sisters, and their children."Cameroon native and coalition representative Lumumba Chia said it's a blatant lie that "South Africans are xenophobic". He said certain politicians are trying to get false popularity from frustrated, poor South Africans.Most illegal immigrants from the continent want to get their documents in order, but are hindered by Home Affairs policy,&nbsp; he said.He said the system puts unnecessary backlogs on the residence claims of African immigrants, but that their European counterparts don't have that problem. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
