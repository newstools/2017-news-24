Venterpotch, Mooirivier, Tlokwe, Mooinoka and Taaiboschbult.These are some of the suggestions for a name for the new Potchefstroom/Ventersdorp municipality, Netwerk24 reported. The names of struggle heroes JB Marks and Josie Mpama, who both hail from the area, were also put forward. Fears that the money of the Tlokwe municipality in Potchefstroom will disappear into a bottomless pit to finance Ventersdorp have also led to a few tongue-in-cheek suggestions, including Flenterstroom. "Flenters" means "in tatters". Ventersdorp is currently experiencing serious financial and service delivery problems. The cut-off date for suggestions for a new name was last week and about 840 were received.Ben Bole, spokesperson for North West's local government department, said the Tlokwe-Ventersdorp council's portfolio committee would go through the names on Wednesday and then make a recommendation. The whole process to get a name for what is now known as Ventersdorp-Tlokwe NW405, will probably be finalised by the end of June, Bole added.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
