Lauren Klaasen, News24Cape Town - Following the biggest Cabinet reshuffle since President Jacob Zuma took office in 2009, which&nbsp;unfolded on Thursday night, the ZumaMustFall hashtag has made a comeback on Twitter.Zuma appointed 10 new ministers and 10 deputy ministers, axing Cabinet members including Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, his deputy Mcebisi Jonas, and Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom.Many took to Twitter to say "enough is enough".The ZumaMustFall hashtag made several appearances on Twitter and during numerous "Zuma Must Fall" movements last year.Since the announcement of the new Cabinet members, Twitter users have expressed their dismay. Here are some of their tweets:Enough is enough makahambe lo mkhulu #zumamustfall pic.twitter.com/j44X6lx65WDear Jacob Zuma, The power of the people is greater than the people in power.
