Even if the rains started soon, it would take a long time to make up the losses incurred during the drought.Sonday said that if a housing developer eventually got the go-ahead to build over the PHA, storm water would be diverted and wasted, instead of refilling the aquifer."We are the only production area in the country that is completely drought-proof," he said.Father and son team Michael and Reece Julie explained that the underground water source was a lifesaver and deserved to be protected."The beauty of this area is that I don't know of any other agricultural land so close to the city. Transport costs are low, and water costs are low because of the aquifer."Sonday is expected to address the conference, which is being webcast to participating churches globally, on Friday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
