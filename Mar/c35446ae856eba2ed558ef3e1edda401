They are so named for their impressive tusks which nearly scrape the ground. About 15 of these are in Kenya."They are icons, they are ambassadors for elephants," he said.He said one of Satao II's tusks weighed 51.5kg, and the other 50.5kg."I am pretty gutted really. This particular elephant was one that was very approachable, one of those easy old boys to find. Many are the others are much more difficult to see" and stay in remote areas, said Moller."He has been through lots of droughts and probably other attempts at poaching."The Tsavo ecosystem covers some 42000 square kilometres, a major challenge for rangers from the KWS to patrol.The Tsavo Trust helps monitor the elephants through aerial and ground reconnaissance, and works closely with KWS. Moller praised the "pretty swift action" which led to the two poachers' arrest.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
