His dedication to the development of a new generation of young leaders would ensure that his impact on the development of a new, better society would endure for years to come.Sacrificed most of his life"I join the people of South Africa &ndash; and friends from across the world &ndash; in extending my deepest sympathies to his wife, Barbara, and his family, friends and comrades."Your love and support sustained him through a lifetime of service, sacrifice and struggle," Ramaphosa said.Earlier, former president Kgalema Motlanthe, who also sits on the foundation&rsquo;s board, said Kathrada had sacrificed most of his youthful and adult life, "unmindful of the consequences to himself".He never faltered as a liberation fighter on all the political platforms he was part of, Motlanthe said."This made him a special South African and one of those rare human beings who belong to the South African and African political pantheon."He will forever remain in our hearts. The ANC will miss him, as will South Africa, Africa and the world."Go well comrade Kathy! Yours was a life well lived!!! It was an ode to the very notion of being human!" Motlanthe said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
