One of their lawyers, Assureira Sebastiao, on Wednesday said the verdict was a "political" decision and said there would be an appeal. Unita has denied any involvement in the affair.The other defendants in the group were acquitted or sentenced to lighter jail terms that were covered by time already served in custody.General elections are scheduled to be held in Angola in August, but Dos Santos, 74, has said he does not intend to seek a further term.Massive oil boom&nbsp;He has named his defence minister, Joao Manuel Goncalves Lourenco, as his successor.Dos Santos has governed the oil-rich central-western African power since 1979, just four years after independence from Portugal, making him Africa's second-longest serving leader after Equatorial Guinea's Teodoro Obiang Nguema.For half of his tenure, Angola was gripped by a bloody civil war that ended only in 2002, which was followed by a massive oil boom.But critics say millions of Angolans have missed out on the wealth, corruption is widespread and dissent is brutally repressed.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
