"scruffy" white shirt in Mauritius this week and it's not the one
you're thinking of. The 93-year-old president was one of very few dignitaries at
the African Economic Platform who actually stuck to the specified dress code,
says state ZBC radio. Said ZBC: "The AU Foundation which organised the
[African Economic Platform] specified in its invitations that the dress code
for participants at the summit should be smart casual." The broadcaster said the longtime Zimbabwe leader, whose
frequent overseas trips for medical attention worry his nation, was wearing a
"Cuban style shirt". There was bewilderment from some Zimbabweans on social media
on Monday when Mugabe was snapped cutting a lonely figure in Mauritius  in
an untucked white shirt. Around him, fellow dignitaries wore suits. ZBC said
Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth also "observed the dress
code" during his opening remarks. State TV said Mugabe was "well-dressed" in its
main evening news bulletin. Mugabe's spokesperson George Charamba told ZBC: "The
trouble is that we are so schooled in British dress etiquette that any
departure from it amounts to scruffiness." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
