"It's a tricky health situation. The usual Boeing 767 is awaiting a C-check (major aircraft service) which requires over $150 000. The airline does not have this kind of money now," an unnamed official was quoted in the story as saying, adding that "He [Mugabe] could also not use the Boeing 737 because it would require stop-overs every four hours to refuel and other technical check-ups."Mugabe's spokesperson George Charamba confirmed to state media this week that Mugabe&nbsp;had left the country for a scheduled medical check-up and was expected back in the country next week on Monday.Mudzungairi and Chidza were summoned on Friday morning before being charged with undermining the authority of Mugabe, their lawyer, Obey Shava reportedly said.&nbsp;Shava said that the publishers of the paper Alpha Media Holdings was the first accused, while &nbsp;Mudzungairi and Chidza were second and third accused respectively. "The first accused is Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) and the second accused is the editor and the third accused is the journalist. They are accused of breaching section 33 of criminal law codification and reform act, undermining or insulting the office of the president," Shava was quoted as saying.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
