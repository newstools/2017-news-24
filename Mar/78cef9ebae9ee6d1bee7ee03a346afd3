We love our country and we appreciate that we need to help others as they did during the harshest times in the country."She said she saw the effects of xenophobia when her son told her he had assaulted a foreign national."I saw the anger in my son's eyes and I decided that I needed to make a change in my house. It is hard to face up to your own faults. I was shocked to hear what my son and his friends had done and I wanted to make sure I lead by example."Sibiya said she decided to join the march to educate herself and her family on the meaning of ubuntu."My family was in the struggle. My uncles were in exile. How can I hate someone who welcomed my family into their country when we needed help the most?"Sebei said they would not be deterred by their rejection from the presidency."We are not going to give them a choice but to respond to our demands. We are going to mobilise in our communities," Sebei said.#MarchAgainstXenophobia organisers are baffled by "government granting permission for march against foreigners but not theirs" @News24 pic.twitter.com/UROWs6Zp11Viva Africa #MarchagaintsXenophobia @News24 pic.twitter.com/f8j25hhhtr24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
