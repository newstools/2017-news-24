Just be honest, please," she tweeted.Just before she boarded her flight, she tweeted: "Getting onto an aeroplane now and won't get onto the Wi-Fi so that I can cut off those who think EVERY aspect of colonial legacy was bad."She later apologised for "a tweet that may have come across as a defence of colonialism".But by then her successor as leader of the DA, Mmusi Maimane, and some other party members had distanced themselves from her comments.Getting onto an aeroplane now and won't get onto the wi-fi so that I can cut off those who think EVERY aspect of colonial legacy was bad.&mdash; Helen Zille (@helenzille) March 16, 2017Getting onto an aeroplane now and won't get onto the wi-fi so that I can cut off those who think EVERY aspect of colonial legacy was bad.No Twitter banDuring Zille's attendance in the provincial legislature later that day, angry MPLs rounded on her and the ANC caucus has since asked the Speaker for a snap debate on the topic.The Speaker's office is still deciding what to do about the request.Meanwhile, Selfe said Zille had not been suspended."Our view on the matter is that the suspension is normally only contemplated when the person being investigated interferes with the investigation or intimidates witnesses," he said.Zille had also not been ordered to stay off Twitter."She has obvious rights as a citizen of South Africa to freedom of expression, and I would have thought that perhaps in view of this investigation, she would obviously want to temper it herself."DA Leader @MmusiMaimane has referred @helenzille to the Federal Legal Commission for investigation: https://t.co/jGjRTKECLs&mdash; Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) March 16, 2017DA Leader @MmusiMaimane has referred @helenzille to the Federal Legal Commission for investigation: https://t.co/jGjRTKECLsI apologise unreservedly for a tweet that may have come across as a defence of colonialism.
