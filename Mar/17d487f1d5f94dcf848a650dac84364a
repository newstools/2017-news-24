However, this application was opposed by the South African government&nbsp;who argued that the centre was not a neutral party and that such submissions should focus only on points of international law. This was despite the fact that SALC had brought the urgent application to have Al-Bashir arrested, back in&nbsp;June 2015, and had in-depth and factual knowledge of the case.Despite government&rsquo;s objection, SALC however admitted to make its submissions.&nbsp;"SALC's submissions clearly demonstrate that South Africa had both domestic and international legal obligations to arrest and surrender President Al-Bashir to the ICC when he arrived in&nbsp;the country in 2015."However the facts show that South Africa flouted these obligations by actively facilitating President Al-Bashir&rsquo;s escape, or, at the very least,&nbsp;by failing to comply with its duty to arrest and surrender him to the ICC", said Kaajal Ramjathan-Keogh, SALC's&nbsp;Executive Director.SALC said the submissions would show how&nbsp;various government departments appeared to have colluded to facilitate the departure of Al-Bashir from South Africa. "Had these Ministers wanted to ensure compliance with the interim court order, which sought to prevent Al-Bashir&rsquo;s departure while the matter was being heard, they could have taken steps to inform their officials, in whose care the Sudanese delegation was entrusted," said Ramjathan-Keogh. SALC was expected to attend the hearing, which was to be&nbsp;broadcast live from Court Room at the ICC.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
