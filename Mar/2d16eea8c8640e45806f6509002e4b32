How many units will it be? Will it be 10 units, will it be five units? And we don&rsquo;t imagine that it will be much.&rdquo;SACP Cape Town deputy chairperson Thembela Duka said the province&rsquo;s decision was a return to apartheid.&ldquo;They are moving our people far away from the city centre. They are prioritising private developers,&rdquo; Duka said.Reclaim the City is a subsidiary of Ndifuna Ukwazi. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
