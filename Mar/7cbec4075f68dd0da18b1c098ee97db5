Aliché Stuurman (11) from Papenkuil Primary School in Gelvandale, recently became the best U/12 trials player and also the best overall trials player of the Nelson Mandela Bay Junior Chess Union (NMBJCU). Papenkuil Primary School was also placed third in the A League in the Bay. Papenkuil’s chess convenor, Leela Chowhan, said Aliché started playing chess at the age of 8 and has represented the province since then in the National Chess Championships held in different provinces over the years. “She has been selected to participate in the South African Closed Chess Championships held in Benoni from April 5 to 13, but she requires sponsorship to get her there.” According to Chowhan, Aliché would need about R8 000 for the trip and she will be accompanied by her father.
