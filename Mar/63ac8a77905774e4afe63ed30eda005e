"Our gathering today marks a turning point, since these recommendations made by the commission are binding and we now have to accept them and focus on working together to ensure that we build a better future together," said Dube-Ncube.In his address to his traditional community, Inkosi Dube called upon everyone to work together for unity and peace as there was much work that needed to be done for the community to progress to the desired level in terms of provision of service delivery.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
