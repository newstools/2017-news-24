"If I do it, I know it will attract men," said retail worker Stella Brew, 19, wearing a white, knee-length dress.The teenager said her church also preached against "provocative" clothing. "It makes the one who gets attracted to you to sin," she told AFP.Boatemaa Akua Benedicte, a 24-year-old nursing graduate wearing a flared dress with an African print headband, said a woman was responsible if she was attacked while wearing a short skirt.The rapist should shoulder only some of the blame, she added.High school student Maria Abdullha, 17, also shied away from short dresses. "If you wear short clothing, people will think bad about you," she said.Hanson said Djaba's comments - and those of the women in the street - showed such views remained pervasive in Ghanaian society.But she said the outcry, particularly on social media, indicated there had been a "serious rise in consciousness" about the issue of rape and sexual assault.Hanson runs sex education workshops for young people in Accra, focusing on consent and tackling rape culture.She said the minister had at least opened up a public debate about the issue.Shifts burden&nbsp;Accra-based journalist Nana Ama Agyemang Asante has spoken out against Djaba on social media and radio programmes.She told AFP she understood Djaba was trying to ensure girls' safety but described the theory that clothing prevents or invites rape as "sexist and stupid".It "absolves the rapist of any responsibility for his actions (and) shifts the burden of preventing rape to the woman", she added.The comments did little to change the reluctance among Ghanaian women to report rape for fear of being shamed or blamed, she said.The results of a 2015 government survey suggested that 30% of women would face some form of sexual violence in their lifetime.The same study indicated nearly two-thirds of women believed a woman was to blame for rape if she wore revealing clothes: just over half of all male respondents (56.2%) agreed.Statistics for sexual and gender-based violence were not immediately available but last year the previous administration reportedly said only 4.4% of cases made it to court.Djaba, who has two daughters and a son, has defended her comments, telling local media she was dispensing "strong advice from a mother to her children". "I wasn't in anyway encouraging rape with my comments," she added.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
