This is a clear move by state securocrats to try [and] clamp down on freedom of expression and increase their powers to censor the internet."'Cyber bullies'R2K said the call from Mahlobo came on the back of a range of existing and "deeply problematic censorship policies"."Regulation of social media already exists. [Platforms] like Twitter and Facebook have added self-regulation measures to empower users to take action against online harassment and cut down on the spread of fake news and propaganda."Meanwhile, DA spokesperson on telecommunications and postal services Marian Shinn said the call from Mahlobo was "worrying"."Such statements pose a direct threat to media and internet freedom in SA. Instead of making such irresponsible threats, our government should rather distance itself from the continent's despots when it comes to developing policies and regulations for internet behaviour."Shinn said Mahlobo's concerns about false news and scams needed to be looked at against the backdrop of "the pending 2019 general election and the increasing denial of digital rights by African governments feeling threatened by the citizen empowerment that the world wide web facilitates".Shinn highlighted how the SA government, "along with cyber bullies such as Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and India", had voted against the United Nations Human Rights Council's declaration that access to the internet was a human right. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
