Andrew Felix Kaweesi was being driven to work early on Friday when his car was attacked by unknown assailants. Also killed were a driver and a bodyguard, said presidential spokesperson Don Wanyama. Watch the video of the three bodies being driven away from the scene of the shooting. There was no word yet on the possible motive, but the suburb where the attack occurred is noted for its relatively high crime rate. Kaweesi's last public appearance as spokesperson was at an event on Wednesday where he disputed a Human Rights Watch report that accused Ugandan forces of killing scores of people during an attack on a tribal leader's palace in November. Uganda has been rocked by a series of apparently targeted killings, many involving Muslim clerics, in recent years. At least a dozen Muslim clerics have been shot dead since 2012, killings that remain largely unsolved. In March 2015 a high-profile prosecutor named Joan Kagezi, who had been involved in a case involving alleged Islamic extremists, was shot dead by gunmen in a Kampala suburb as she tried to buy groceries. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
