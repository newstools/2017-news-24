"But luckily we were able to arrest him."'Blood everywhere'&nbsp;Kneip said the suspect's brother had worried when he bought an axe about a week earlier.And when he realised his brother had left their home in Wuppertal, 30km west of D&uuml;sseldorf, he phoned the police to report him missing.But the call could not prevent the attack shortly before 21:00 (20:00 GMT).Among the victims were a 13-year-old girl who sustained bad injuries to her upper arm, two female Italian tourists and another woman, as well as five male commuters, all aged between 30 and 50."We were on the platform waiting for the train," an unnamed witness told Bild daily. "The train arrived and suddenly someone with an axe came out and started attacking people. "There was blood everywhere."The man then tried to re-enter the carriage but the train driver locked the doors, protecting the terrified passengers inside who looked on as he beat the windows with his fists, police said.On edge&nbsp;Germany has been on edge after a string of attacks in recent months - several claimed by Islamic State jihadists, including a truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market in December which left 12 people dead.The security services say there are about 10 000 radical Islamists in the country, of whom 1 600 are suspected of having links to militant groups.But there have also been several attacks where the assailants have turned out to be psychologically unstable.Last July, a mentally disturbed 17-year-old migrant wielding an axe and a knife went on a rampage on a train in southern Germany, seriously injuring four people. And last month, a 35-year-old German national, who was reportedly suffering from psychiatric problems, drove his car into a group of pedestrians in the southwestern city of Heidelberg, killing one and injuring two.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
