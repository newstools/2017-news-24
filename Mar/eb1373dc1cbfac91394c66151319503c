"Who will be liable for us if we go missing?" Nearly 40 000 uprooted people live in the Juba camp. Gatwot Matai, head teacher at one of three secondary schools set up there, said they had prepared 965 students to sit the exams but only 70 had dared to leave to take the tests.Matai said the education ministry gave no explanation when it issued an order last week that all students must sit their exams outside the UN base.Contacted by AFP, South Sudan's National Secretary for Examinations, Lul Ruei Dhol, said, "We are working on a solution" but gave no further details. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
