To be honest, we are starting to doubt them," she said.Science centre 'just talk'Some learners said the promises were just part of a campaign for the local government elections.A learner from St James High School said at the imbizo there were more people wearing ANC T-shirts than there were parents."They got us because we voted for the ANC thinking that they were going to build us a science centre as promised," she said.Cofimvaba Senior Secondary School principal Noxolo Sabata said: "Officials from Intsika Yethu municipality were here at our school in January to congratulate us on getting a 92% matric pass rate. They spoke about the science centre, but that was just talk." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
