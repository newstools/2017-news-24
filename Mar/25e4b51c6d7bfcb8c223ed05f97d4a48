The choir had hired a canoe to facilitate crossing the river Mtete which demarcated the two villages. The river was flooded due to heavy rainfall."The choir... managed to cross the river safely when going but things were not the same when they were returning home&hellip; The canoe developed [a] leakage and started accumulating water very quickly through holes and spaces," the report said. This forced the canoe to capsize. Well-wishers rushed to rescue the victims.It was later discovered that Innocent who had been on his mother&rsquo;s lap was missing. Search for him proved fruitless until he was found on Monday floating on top of the water.This came just a few weeks after a 28-year-old fisherman drowned in Lake Malawi.His body was found floating.
