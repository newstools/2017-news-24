Clarke, however, dismissed the initiative as a &ldquo;desperate attempt to buy prisoners&rsquo; votes with KFC".Clarke said according to the department&rsquo;s response, all procurement procedures were followed and the expenditure incurred came from the budget of the office of the MEC. &ldquo;Why would the department mislead the public and the media in saying it cost just over R60 000, when in fact it had been signed off from the Office Budget for over double the amount?"She said engagements with criminals didn&rsquo;t warrant a dish-out of take-away chicken.&nbsp;Clarke said the party would submit further questions to obtain the alleged three service provider quotations and the supply chain procurement documentation.&ldquo;We will continue to haul the MEC over the coals and grill her for her decision in dishing out finger-licking food.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
