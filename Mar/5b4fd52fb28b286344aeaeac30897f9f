We suspect that a pupil took the dog to school to show his friends but, after losing courage, pretended it was a stray."The dog was found at a school in downtown Bloemfontein.He was receiving care for a severe infection on its cut ear. It is still unclear what caused the sores on its body.Meyer appealed to the public to help with any information on what happened to the dog, or who the owner is.The Bloemfontein SPCA&nbsp;can be contacted on 051 447 3801. All information will be kept confidential.
