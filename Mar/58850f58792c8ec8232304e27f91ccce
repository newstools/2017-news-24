She said that the small prizes handed over this time were "painful."That hasn't stopped some Zimbabweans online expressing their consternation."Who is to blame for this shocking $8.50 prize given to the Miss Deaf 2017?" tweeted radio station @capitalkfm.Said @Oldschoolvalue1: "They deserve better."Herald writer Tafadzwa Zimoyo said the prize was "a shock in the history of beauty pageants."&nbsp;Hukuimwe will go on to represent Zimbabwe at Miss Deaf World and Miss Deaf Africa, the Herald said.See tweets belowhttps://t.co/MHVQWM1FdZ $26.50 prize money shared amongst Miss Deaf Zim winners??????
