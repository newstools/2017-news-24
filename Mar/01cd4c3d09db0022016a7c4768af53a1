The militias, which oppose the parliament, say they intend to take the eastern city of Benghazi and drive Field Marshal Khalifa Hifter from the area. Hifter's army is allied to the parliament, while the Tripoli government opposes him."The GNA unity government is not legitimate any more, as well as its presidential council and anything to do with this entity," Ablaihig said, urging the international community to lift an embargo on weapons sales to the Libyan army under Hifter.His forces have deployed more troops in preparation of a counterattack to drive out the militias, known as the Benghazi Defense Brigades, which are comprised of Islamic militants and former rebels recently defeated by Hifter's forces in Benghazi, Libya' second largest city. They are also joined by militiamen from the western city of Misrata, and a day earlier announced their intentions from there.Libya descended into chaos with its 2011 civil war, which ended with the killing of longtime dictator Moammar Gaddafi and led to the current split.Western ambassadors have condemned the escalation of violence and called for an immediate cease-fire. Egypt on Tuesday condemned the seizing of the oil installations more singularly, saying that "elements linked to al-Qaeda" were involved in the attack, which it said posed "serious risks" for Libya.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
