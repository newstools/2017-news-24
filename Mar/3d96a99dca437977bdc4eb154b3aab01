In as much as we want to protect the rights to the cultural practice, we must also ensure that rights of children are always paramount," said Mzinyathi."The deaths of initiates as a result of botched circumcisions - from both legal and unregistered initiation schools - or any harm [caused] to initiates due to conduct at the initiation school, directly infringes on the initiate's rights to dignity and life," reads a report from the NPA.Other recommendations by the NPA include the possibility of introducing a national register of those found guilty of offences for record-keeping purposes, and an efficient monitoring process that regulates the number of initiations a traditional surgeon can perform daily.WATCH this video:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
