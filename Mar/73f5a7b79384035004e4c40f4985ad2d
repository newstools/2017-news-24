They later withdrew money from her accounts.The woman, whose young son was forced to lie on the floor of the taxi while she was being raped on the backseat, told the radio station she hoped her example would encourage other women to lay charges in order to prevent more attacks.Following leadsThe radio station received many related calls after that and the Gauteng police confirmed that they were investigating several similar cases.Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said it was difficult to say exactly how many victims there are because they suspect that not all the cases have been reported."The police are investigating various cases involving a group of three to four men who reportedly are using a white and grey Quantum minibus taxi to commit the crimes," Dlamini said. "We are following up on several leads in order to identify the suspects."According to Dlamini, the gang is active in the Johannesburg area, especially Booysens, Soweto and Roodepoort. It is suspected that they pretend to be taxi drivers on these routes to lure their victims.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
