He returned in September 2016, but then left permanently in October."I basically learnt he had been cleared of the allegations, but there was very serious discomfort about him having to come back. They said he was a risk, so he can't come back," Nkosi had said.She said she didn't know if the SSA's involvement was "forgotten" or deliberately kept from her, but she said it had been downplayed.MPs across the political spectrum registered their shock on hearing that the SSA was involved in an investigation of an SABC staff member.The SABC 8 journalists told the committee how journalists had been harassed at the broadcaster. One had a laptop seized and searched, and returned when nothing was found.Snake that 'eats other snakes'President Jacob Zuma appointed Dintwe on March 13, after Parliament recommended him for the job.He is the head of the police practice department at the University of South Africa. The published author and co-editor has worked as a police constable, a detective, and as a principal anti-corruption investigator.During his interviews for the post, he told the joint standing committee on intelligence that he was an expert in forensics."I am competent for this office. I'm a cocktail, all in one. My career goes across all different spheres that are involved in anything which deals with the criminal justice system in this country," he told MPs.He was a snake that ate other snakes, he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
