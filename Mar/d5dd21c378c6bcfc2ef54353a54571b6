Illegal Zimbabwe migrants are now paying to slip across the crocodile-infested river to South Africa in dinghies, a report says.Masvingo &ndash; A Zimbabwean woman, Nyaradzo Makholiso, 38, miraculously survived cyclone induced floods by "hanging precariously on a tree branch for six hours", with her 2-months old baby strapped on her back, a report says.&nbsp;The floods were a result of torrential rains induced by cyclone Dineo which hit parts of the southern African country two weeks ago.&nbsp;According to The Standard, families in Masvingo's Chivi area were left devastated by the floods after one of the rivers in the area burst open, leaving a trail of destruction. Makholiso and Maud Goredema (65) of Nzviyo village watched helplessly as their houses were swept away by the floods.Narrating her ordeal, Makholiso, dressed in an orange top, a tattered brown skirt and torn sandals - the only clothes left after floods swept away all her belongings - said she was left homeless. Her livestock were also swept away."I owe my survival to this tree. Had it not been for this tree, I would be dead...," Makholiso reportedly said, as she looked at a Mobola plum tree, with tears trickling down her cheeks.Reports last week indicated that floods in the southern African country had killed at least&nbsp;246 people and left nearly 2 000 homeless&nbsp;since December. &nbsp;The country had since appealed to international donors for $100 million to assist those affected.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
