Mohamed Deeq, a member of the Puntland coastguard, told AFP earlier that if talks to free the vessel and eight Sri Lankan hostages failed, "the forces will possibly engage" the pirates.&nbsp;Illegal fishing fuels piracy&nbsp;The Aris 13 was about 18km off the Somali coast when it was attacked, according to Steed. He said the vessel was not following the "best practices" put in place to avoid piracy, since it was taking a cost- and time-saving route too close to Somalia's coastline, was travelling too slowly and was without an armed escort.Village elders of Alula said the pirates had not made clear demands, but claimed to be driven by anger over illegal fishing."These are fishermen who are infuriated with the illegal fishing off their coasts. They desperately need to show their grievances by seizing the boat," said Abdiwahab Ahmed, an elder in Alula. In Sri Lanka, a spokesperson for AJ Shipping Private Limited which represents the Greek owner of the Aris 13 met with family members of the hostages.The spokesperson Tyronne Fernando said the owner of the ship had spoken to its captain Nicholas Thangenthren who had assured him that all the hostages were unharmed."We are confident that the crew will be released very soon," Fernando told family members in the presence of reporters.Somali pirates began staging waves of attacks in 2005, seriously disrupting a major international shipping route and costing the global economy billions of dollars.At the peak of the piracy crisis in January 2011, 736 hostages and 32 boats were held. Though anti-piracy measures ended attacks on commercial vessels, fishing boats have continued to face attacks.Illegal fishing has long been used by Somali pirates as an excuse for attacks and Steed has in the past warned that the presence of foreign vessels emptying Somali waters could reverse the gains against piracy.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
