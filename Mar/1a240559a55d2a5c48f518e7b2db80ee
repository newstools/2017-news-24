The DA in the Free State wants to take up the water reduction for the cash-strapped Kopanong Local Municipality by Bloem Water with the MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Sisi Ntombela. The cut in water supply is due to the Kopanong Municipality s R190 million debt to Bloem Water. Job Smith, DA councillor in Kopanong, said the water supply to nine towns in Kopanong has been reduced by 25% of the normal supply. He said in order to settle this debt, the municipality needs to pay monthly installments of R4 million. With a pathetic collection rate of 26,3%, the municipality will remain unable to pay Bloem Water, he said. The party has decided to delegate James Letuka, representative serving in COGTA in the provincial legislature, to persuade Ntombela to intervene in the Kopanong Municipality s water crisis.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
