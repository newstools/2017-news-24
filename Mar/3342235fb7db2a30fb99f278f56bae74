"One in every five Central Africans is either displaced internally or is a refugee in neighbouring countries," the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Thursday, adding that 100,000 new internally displaced people had been registered since September.Funding for aid agencies, which are major contributors to basic social services in Central Africa, remains critically short, OCHA said in a statement.President without an army&nbsp;While parts of the country remain wracked by violence, military intervention in 2013 by France and MINUSCA restored relative calm to the capital Bangui.But since France withdrew in October, and with the Central African army still under an international arms embargo, the UN peacekeeping force is now the sole functioning force on the ground.With international support, efforts are under way to bring the national army back into action - though it is unclear how long that process will take.According to General Herman Ruys, who heads the European military training mission in Central Africa, the country's first 750 troops will be ready for operations in mid-May.And at a recent meeting, US ambassador Jeffrey Hawkins pledged $8 million in aid for military equipment purchases, local media reported.On a recent visit to restive Bambari, Touadera announced: "I have come to tell you that I have decided to restore order in Bambari and in Ouaka province."But without a functioning army, it remains to be seen how he plans to do that."The weapons that the army (today) has are barely enough to equip... 150 men," the recently appointed Central African military Chief of Staff Ludovic Ngaifei has said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
