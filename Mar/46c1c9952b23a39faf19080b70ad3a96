It suspended its declaration of the invalidity for that period.Dlamini said she had believed that all the goals that had been set would be met before March 31, 2017, except for one relating to a query system, which would be established thereafter and was not a core aspect of the system."There was therefore no reason to believe that Sassa would not be in a position to comply by 31 March 2017."With hindsight, she believes she should have exercised caution and approached the court for directions earlier in light of the looming deadline."I accept the concern by the court that the interests of the beneficiaries of social grants stood a real risk of being compromised. This I say with the benefit of hindsight."In retrospect, she said she should have demanded greater accountability from Sassa officials and more frequent communication and updates on the progress of implementing their plan.The turnover of leadership at Sassa between 2012 and 2016 partly explained the disconnect in communication, she said.RegretsShe said she felt she should not be joined in the proceedings personally because she was only discharging her responsibilities as a minister.Her belief, later proved erroneous, was that Sassa would be able to procure another service provider."As it turned out&sbquo; this could not be achieved as there were no compliant bidders."Dlamini said she believed at the time that the application by Sassa to deviate from a competitive procurement process would be approved by Treasury."At that point, hindsight shows that there would have been no legally valid platform to provide those social services without the approval of this court. This I regret."Dlamini retained her position after President Jacob Zuma made major changes to his Cabinet in the early hours of Friday morning.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
