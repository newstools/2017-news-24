Makhosandile Zulu KWADUKUZA SAPS spokesperson, warrant officer Johannes Khoza has said vigilantism in and around KwaDukuza is a growing concern for the SAPS."Mob justice, vigilantism is a concern in the Kwa-Dukuza police patrol area," Khoza said in a statement.He said those suspected of committing crimes end up being hospitalised, and sometimes die following mob justice attacks."One victim of vigilantism was attacked by the community of Ntshawini recently. Such cases are difficult to investigate. Currently, we are investigating seven such cases," Khoza said.He urged locals to desist from taking the law into their hands, they should rather seek assistance from sector and station commanders, heads of crime prevention, community policing forums and subforums in dealing with crimes and those suspected of perpetrating crime in their areas."I appeal to the community to join hands with the SAPS and report cases rather than put those suspected of crimes in kangaroo courts," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
