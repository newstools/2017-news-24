We lived in our house with four other families, surrounded by the spirit of ubuntu. I am from humble beginnings and never realised we didn&rsquo;t have much, even when there was only bread with coffee for dinner."Celebrating history and recipesSome of her favourite memories were made in the kitchen, watching her single mother cook and her sister bake. Mbalo-Mokoena never got an opportunity to stand behind the stove, but was allowed to lick the bowls, she joked.She started dabbling in the kitchen as a student on a shoestring budget, creating new recipes with limited ingredients.After marrying her husband, she had a new guinea pig to sample her creations, Mbalo-Mokoena quipped.He and their three children eventually convinced her to enter season three of MasterChef SA, where her cold audition dish was a terrine made with umleqwa, duck and turkey."Throughout the competition I made dishes which celebrated our township cuisine, such as lamb served with mushrooms and butternut mqa [pap]," she explained.Mbalo-Mokoena made it to the top six, where she was eliminated for failing to create a glass disc using treacle sugar, glucose and isomalt.The burnt sugar which cost her her spot in the competition eventually inspired the toffee apple which features on her dessert menu.Mbalo-Mokoena believes in celebrating the history and recipes stemming from the country&rsquo;s oldest communities, from isiXhosa to Cape Malay."It saddens me that we celebrate other nations&rsquo; food instead of our own. We order paella &ndash; which is actually peasant food &ndash; in restaurants, but won&rsquo;t have our own umngqusho (samp and beans). We look down on it."'Nostalgia through food'The Mokoenas previously lived in Melkbosstrand until they bought a house in Khayelitsha from which to run their fine-dining restaurant.There they grow their own vegetables and allow diners to walk freely through their home, from the pantry to the dining room.Mphako/Padkos/Mofao, situated 200m from the restaurant, was opened two months ago. Here Mbalo-Mokoena grows her own herbs &ndash; which she uses in all her dishes &ndash; in old bathtubs.She employs three locals, and on busy days has two scholars who help her run her business.While it was originally planned to serve as a takeaway business, tourism agencies convinced Mbalo-Mokoena to extend it to include a seating area.Over the coming months she plans to transform it into an open-air replica of a four-room house, where township stories can be shared."I want to invoke memories and nostalgia through food and dialogue. Guests should take that home with them and share it with their neighbours," she said.Too many successful people are moving from the townships to the suburbs, leaving young people still living in poverty without any role models to look up to, Mbalo-Mokoena insisted."It&rsquo;s important that our young black professionals also contribute and invest in the economy here, in areas like Khayelitsha. They are moving out and taking their stories with them, when we should be using our achievements to motivate the youth who still live here."Historical communities with their rich history should be celebrated and developed for tourism opportunities, to decrease poverty and enable job creation. And she is on a mission to do just that."I hope to see this business grow to include our country&rsquo;s oldest townships, from Soweto to Port Elizabeth," Mbalo-Mokoena said."It is up to us to put ourselves on the map."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
