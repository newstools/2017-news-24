We also uncovered approximately 100 skins," he said.The donkeys had not been pre-stunned to render them unconscious prior to slaughter, a contravention of the Animals Protection Act.De Klerk said they discovered that 10 of the donkeys had been slaughtered on Tuesday night."The NSPCA is of the opinion that this is a commercial operation which is involved in the donkey skin trade and also linked to the recent sale in Hartswater in the North West province where an estimated 450 donkeys were auctioned and sold."He said NSPCA personnel were present at the auction, inspecting all the animals and intervening when necessary.De Klerk said an abattoir was discovered on the property, however it was only registered for the slaughter of cattle, sheep and goats - not equines, making the slaughter of the 10 donkeys an offence.The donkey skins have been removed from the property and sent to a place of safety.Criminal charges will be laid against the farm owners in terms of the Animals Protection Act, Stock Theft Act and the Meat Safety Act, De Klerk said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
