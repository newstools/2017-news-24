It was the first time in Nigerian political history that an opposition candidate had won at the ballot box against an incumbent head of state.Buhari took office on May 29, 2015.The vote was initially postponed from February 14, 2015 as the government said the military could not provide security at polling stations because of operations against Boko Haram insurgents.The election passed off broadly without a hitch, despite a history of widespread voter fraud and election-linked violence that left hundreds dead across the country in previous polls.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
