She has never lied to us. I don't have any doubt that I will receive payment on April 1," said 78-year-old ANCWL member Betty Sebotso.Constitutional dutySebotso said she had come to the court in a bus, with several other supporters from Sebokeng.Sebotso receives R1 410 from Sassa. With the money, she is able to support her two great-grandchildren, she said."I know that it's important for the country to go through this process. We don't blame Dlamini. We blame those who are responsible."ANCWL supporter Colly Matolo, from Klerksdorp, said she believed that the Constitutional Court would provide the country with a solution that will appease the country."The solution will please all South Africans. We trust Dlamini."On Wednesday, the court heard that Dlamini had failed in her constitutional duty in respect of social grants and the 17 million beneficiaries.Advocate Geoff Budlender, SC, representing Black Sash, said that as it stood, no-one knew who was going to pay the beneficiaries after March 31.He argued that Dlamini had failed to apologise and take responsibility."The executive has failed to carry out their duties," Budlender told the full bench of justices.The court gallery was packed to capacity with journalists, lawyers and Black Sash supporters.WATCH:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
