The attackers fled toward the border with Mali after security forces streamed in.The Ansaru Islam group, which has links to the Ansar Dine extremist movement in Mali, claimed responsibility for those attacks. Ansaru Islam also killed at least 12 gendarmes in the province in December.The leader of Ansaru Islam is a radical Burkina Faso preacher who earlier this year asked teachers to stop teaching in French and to teach the Quran in Arabic.The violence comes as Burkina Faso hosts an international film festival in Ouagadougou.Burkina Faso was long spared the jihadist unrest experienced by neighbouring countries. But extremists recently have abducted foreigners in the north and in January 2016 launched a major terror attack on a cafe popular with foreigners that killed 30 people.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
