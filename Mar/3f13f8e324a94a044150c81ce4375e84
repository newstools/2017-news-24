The retort is too funny not to laugh.But in between Fransman's heaped scoops of playful criticism, there is politicking through and through."Now comrade Mantashe must know, in the coloured community where I grew up, ice cream selling was not a crime," Fransman said on Friday."In fact many of the professionals of SA today was built on the sweat and hardship of those men and women that sold ice cream in our communities for a living! "So VIVA to the ice-cream sellers!"Fransman then pledged to help 50 poor, unemployed South Africans "become the best ice cream sellers in SA!"What can Mantashe say to that, without risking the disapproval of poor, working class people everywhere?Challenge accepted Mr Mantashe, jelly tots and all. Your move.Mantashe explained to News24 that "selling ice cream" was essentially a call for cheap popularity."When you sell ice cream, you ring a bell and the children come running," he said.He also said it was his first job as a student.This little clash of tastes&nbsp;obviously means more in the context of Andile Lungisa&rsquo;s fate, due to be decided by the party&rsquo;s national executive committee this weekend.If Lungisa wins his claim to stay on as Nelson Mandela Bay chairperson, and resigns from his post on the provincial council, Fransman has backed a side that has won on a national level.More importantly, Mantashe has lost.It may mean very little in Fransman's own appeal against his sexual harassment charges. But it will at least ensure he has more political support from comrades who may have a say in his future later down the line.Until then, he remains out in the cold.But while he is there, he may as well make ice cream.- Paul Herman is a journalist at News24.
