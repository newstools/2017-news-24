This was after the Constitutional Court found he failed to uphold the Constitution when he ignored the Public Protector's recommendation that he repay some of the public money used to upgrade his Nkandla home. "To paraphrase the famous MK slogan of the time: There comes a time in the life of every nation when it must choose to submit or fight. Today I appeal to our president to submit to the will of the people and resign," Kathrada said.&nbsp;Kathrada dedicated his life to fellow human beings - Makhura&nbsp;Gauteng Premier David Makhura has praised one of the last remaining Rivonia trialists for dedicating his life to his fellow human beings.

"He served the ANC and the country with humility and always led with dignity. His values will always inform the work we do for the people," Makhura said on Tuesday.&nbsp;Kathrada, 87, would remain the greatest inspiration to all South Africans.&nbsp;#AhmedKathrada Hatang closes the proceedings saying &quot;We will continue the walk&quot; @News24 pic.twitter.com/bEapl7oOJNIsidingo actor Jack Devnarain recalls the time #AhmedKathrada visited the set pic.twitter.com/Pq1sCPB3DXKathrada's touching eulogy at Nelson Mandela's funeral.&nbsp;WATCH: Mandela's fellow inmate gives emotional speech&nbsp;#Kathrada Hatang: &quot;When you get to the other side tell them that you have left people who won&#39;t let them down.&quot; @News24#Kathrada Hatang: &quot;Our hearts broke when Mr K was delivering his eulogy at Madiba&#39;s funeral.&quot; @News24#Kathrada Hatang: &quot;Kathrada knew how to make everyone feel special.
