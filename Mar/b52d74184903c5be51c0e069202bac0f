We do not feel that it should be about Uber or taxi, but rather Uber AND taxi."Shortly after drivers went on a strike on Friday morning, metered taxi driver Abner Mashikinoya said: "Uber is killing us."Mashikinoya, a member of a task team which was established to kick Uber out of the market, said they had exhausted all avenues in government, and had to go on strike.Drivers&rsquo; memorandum unansweredUber driver Zweli Ngwenya told News24 that some drivers had submitted a memorandum to Uber and were expecting an answer, however the company allegedly did not respond to them.Ngwenya said they wanted the company to know that they wanted to work with them, and not fight them."When we try to talk to them, they always say they do not recognise groups, they recognise individuals. All of us are being intimidated. All of us, our cars are being smashed. It is a problem for each and every driver."He accused the company of not doing anything to address safety issues.But Allenberg said the company was committed to the safety of everyone who uses Uber."The quality of the drivers who use the Uber app is part of the reason so many people choose us as a safe, affordable way to get around Joburg," she said.&nbsp;- FOLLOW&nbsp;Jeanette Chabalala on Twitter24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
