That is what we want to prevent," Mbalula said."We need something like a jury to fight factionalism and to allow quality growth in the organisation."Mbalula admitted that the electoral college proposal is not new&nbsp;and was proposed ahead of the ANC 2007 elective conference held in Polokwane."If you follow ANC renewal from Polokwane, this is not a new thing, we have simply dusted it off... and brought it back with new perfume," Mbalula said.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
