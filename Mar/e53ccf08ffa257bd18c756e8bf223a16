The new floods and mudslides over the past three days follow a series of other storms and officials say that a total of 62 people have died and 12 000 homes have been destroyed so far this year. Authorities said on Thursday they expect the intense rains caused by the warming of surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean to continue another two weeks. Schools nationwide are suspending classes and in the capital of Lima, the swelling Huaycoloro river swept away two trucks and threatens to destroy a bridge. President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski said late on Wednesday that authorities are prepared to provide shelter and relief to those left homeless. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
