"Reform to make it more efficient, yes. Reform to break it down, certainly not," he said.The council is scheduled to decide on MONUSCO's mandate during a meeting on March 29.The United States, by far the biggest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping, is seeking cuts to reduce its share of support for the missions.This year, the United States will be providing nearly 29% &nbsp;of the $7.9bn budget for UN peacekeeping.In his report to the council, Guterres said 2017 will be a "crucial year" for the DRC as it heads toward elections.After months of violence, the influential Catholic Church brokered a deal in late December to pave the way for elections, but the agreement has been bogged down in disputes over the appointment of a new prime minister.Elections would bring an end to the rule of President Joseph Kabila, in power since 2001.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
