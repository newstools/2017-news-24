Some of the 35 people arrested were to appear in court on Friday over offences allegedly committed during the Njala University protests and at related demonstrations in the city of Kenema and in the capital, Freetown, he added.A protest in Makeni in support of the university demonstrators was peaceful, Dumbuya said.Most students had already paid their fees for the year when the strike began, according to Njala University students contacted by AFP, leaving them out of classes for months.In a statement late on Thursday, the government called on Sierra Leoneans to avoid violence at demonstrations, saying that such behaviour "will be met with swift and the full force of the law."The government said negotiations were continuing with university staff and the administration to resolve the dispute.Philip Foday Yamba Thulla, speaking on behalf of the lecturers' association, told AFP that Njala University had been unable to pay wages since 2015, and pensions since 2012."The affected lecturers and retirees are in their hundreds, and the government has been reneging in their duty to fulfil their promise to the Academic Staff Association," Thulla said. The university administration, he added, had "failed us completely".The government has called for a crisis meeting to be held on Monday, but the lecturers have not yet said if they will attend.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
