It can never be justified.&rdquo; &mdash; Mmusi Maimane (@MmusiMaimane)&nbsp;March 16, 2017Zille apologised for offence the tweet may have caused, but it was enough for the party to institute the first stages of possible disciplinary procedures.On Saturday afternoon, the party will interview her and send a report to its federal executive, which will recommend whether a disciplinary panel should take it further.The ANC welcomed Fernandez's decision because it believed the DA turned a blind eye to what Zille did.The ANC believed that if the DA continued protecting Zille, the party would be brought down.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
