The United Nations has nearly 19 000 troops deployed in the DRC, its largest and costliest peacekeeping mission."2017 will be a crucial year for the Democratic Republic of Congo," said Guterres in the report sent to the council on Friday."MONUSCO presence in the country therefore remains essential to help keep the political process on track, preserve the gains made and shore up the prospects for stability in the country," he added.Last year, former UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon had proposed cutting 1 700 troops from MONUSCO but the Security Council decided against the draw-down.The council is scheduled to vote on possible changes to MONUSCO's mandate on March 29. The request for more police came after US Ambassador Nikki Haley promised to review all peacekeeping missions with the aim of cutting costs and shutting some down altogether.While the United States has few soldiers serving as peacekeepers, it is by far the biggest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping, providing nearly 29% of the $7.9bn budget for this year.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
