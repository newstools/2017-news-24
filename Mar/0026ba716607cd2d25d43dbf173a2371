He waved, then shaped his three fingers into a gun, pointing at me," she said in her statement.Nomala told the court that Vuyiseka had wanted to divorce Mzuvukile, against whom she had a protection order.Grisly sceneHis neighbours in Westlake have also submitted a petition to Nomala indicating that they did not want him to return to their community "because they are going to kill him".Locals tried to intervene when Mzuvukile allegedly chased Vuyiseka as she escaped from her house to the home of a friend.She fled into the woman's bedroom and Mzuvukile apparently forced his way into the house, locked the door and stabbed her.According to witnesses, she had more than 30 wounds on her body.Nomala on Tuesday told the court when he arrived at the grisly scene, a wall was covered in blood and Vuyiseka's bloody body lay on her friend's bed.Mzuvukile was arrested by the responding officers at his home.Nomala said a post-mortem found a sexual act had occurred before Vuyiseka's death. Police believe her husband raped her.Child's health deterioratingMzuvukile, a project administrator, previously told the court he would plead guilty with reasons, but elected to remain silent on the merits of the case.The couple had three children together, while Mzuvukile had another outside the marriage.Nomala told the court that their 12-year-old daughter's health had deteriorated after losing her mother."The child wants to ask [her father] why he killed her mother," the officer said.The girl had had a kidney transplant and Mzuvukile previously told the court he wanted to be released on bail to take care of her.At the start of his bail application he told Magistrate Goolam Bawa that he stabbed his wife on January 2, but claimed he had not been told she had died of her wounds.The application was postponed to March 30.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
