He previously testified that he had had only had three sips of traditional African beer that day. Yengeni said he had been at a family gathering for a traditional ceremony in Gugulethu earlier in the afternoon and had had nothing else to drink. He said he had drunk umqombothi (home-brewed beer) many times before without incident, and that it had a low alcohol content compared to spirits. He previously claimed his prosecution was part of a political conspiracy against him. In a separate matter in 2007 Yengeni was found not guilty of drunk driving after he was arrested in Goodwood, Cape Town.
