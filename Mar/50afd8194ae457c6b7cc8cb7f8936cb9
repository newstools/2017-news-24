Jump to bottom #SASSA Unterhalter submits to the court that they try a tripartite approach - deal with an extension, then an interim agreement, then finalRadebe and co will appoint new Sassa, CPS negotiators, MPs told&nbsp;A ministerial task team led by Minister Jeff Radebe will appoint new negotiators to strike a deal with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) to pay social grants, the portfolio committee on social development heard on Wednesday. Any previous negotiations led by Sassa would be declared void, and the task team which was established last Wednesday&nbsp;would lead the process, SA Social Security Agency grants administrator Dianne Dunkerley told MPs. Minister in the Presidency Radebe was&nbsp;elected as the team s chairperson. Dunkerley said the new negotiation team would be appointed on behalf of Sassa once the Constitutional Court case being heard on Wednesday was concluded. The new contract with CPS would be limited, and "certainly won't be a long-term interim contract". MPs asked her if the new negotiators had enough time to negotiate in two weeks, before Sassa s current, illegal, contract with CPS ends.&nbsp;#SASSA He says Sassa &amp; Minister still did not try to maintain that any new contract should not limit what CPS could benefit from. @news24#SASSA Unterhalter says this is compared to about R800m profit, but Sassa &amp; Minister still didn&#39;t raise any issues with the new terms@news24#SASSA The difference between the current R16.44 cost for serveice per grant &amp; the proposed R22 would have given CPS more than R1bn profit#SASSA Unterhalter says in one of the letters, CPS tells Sassa that if a new contract isn&#39;t arranged soon, they may liquidate subsidiariesUnterhalter: CPS basically said they will reduce services and leveled implicit threat that this may create chaos or problems #SASSA#SASSA Says in a letter sent to Sassa on Dec 28, asking that a new contract be arranged by 2 January, to avoid major payment disturbancesUnterhalter: CPS tried to use their unfair bargaining power to secure better terms for new contract. #SASSA#SASSA Unterhalter says CPS wrote numerous letters to Sassa to use their bargaining power to use Ts &amp; Cs that would benefit them. @news24#SASSA small band of police keeping guard in and around ConCourt @News24 pic.twitter.com/BJ0p4QMiXp#SASSA Unterhalter says in May 2016 CPS said time was running out, but they got no answer about what was going on @News24#SASSA he tells the court that CPS kept sending letters to Dlamini &amp; Sassa to warn that time is running out &amp; they need new signed contract.Black Sash supporters who are also grant beneficiaries hold placards reading &quot;ConCourt supervise #SASSA&quot; @News24 pic.twitter.com/g2k0JgiGKc#SASSA Unterhalter: CPS contends that the whole situation is not of its own making, its on Dlamnini &amp; Sassa, he&#39;s reading an ans affidavit.#SASSA Black Sash supporters are adamant that CPS should be shown the door @News24#SASSA Unterhalter still maintaining that either way CPS is doing a public service, can&#39;t make a loss, but mustn&#39;t make a profit either.#SASSA Judges are arguing that at the time of handing it down, they didn&#39;t foresee that there&#39;d be a need for 1 to outrun the other @News24Black Sash at Constitutional Court today. #SASSA #HandsOffOurGrants pic.twitter.com/pvsyMcAYOX#SASSA Debates of how the ConCourt can extend its suspension order, even though the contract inevitably comes to an end on March 31.#Parliament&nbsp;Any previous negotiations by #Sassa officials with CPS will therefore be put on hold, Dunkerley told MPs. @News24#Parliament&nbsp;The ministerial task team will appoint the new #Sassa negotiation team once the ConCourt case being heard on Wednesday is concluded. @News24#SASSA Mogoeng: Was it open to this court for order that contract come to an end before March 31 not knowing it would need 2 extend lifespan#SASSA So how will ConCourt take it further when that particular contract is up? asks Justice Madlanga @news24#SASSA Justice Madlanga says the suspension of the current contract comes to an end on March 31, when the contract itself ends. @News24#SASSA Black Sash supporters and friends of the court camped outside ConCourt @News24 pic.twitter.com/PEtlZlRhRl#SASSA Balamant shaking his head as Unterhalter tells court that CPS used its position over the years to benefit from this @News24#SASSA Colly Matolo from Klerksdorp on her #ANCWL leader Bathabile Dlamini @News24 pic.twitter.com/ZX1Kc66JhL#SASSA It is because of the power of CPS&#39;s incumbency that it is rested with enormous negotiating power, says Unterhalter @news2#SASSA Unterhalter - As a matter of principle, the no benefit rule should be maintained so that all parties no where they stand. @news24#SASSA David Unterhalter, for Freedom Under Law says CPS has enjoyed benefits over a period of five years @News24#SASSA Justice Froneman asks if CPS should have the opportunity to relax the &#39;no benefit&#39; terms with National Treasury.
