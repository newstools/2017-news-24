When the department visited the patients&rsquo; homes, they found the relatives had moved.The department did not want to rush the process.She said she did not think more resources could have prevented the deaths. There was much that had gone wrong that was unrelated to the availability of resources.&ldquo;The one contributing factor to this unfortunate disaster is that the team that worked on this project, worked in silos.&ldquo;We are working with a team that understands mentally ill patients, people that understand that they also have rights and that they need to be well-cared for, even after they have been transferred. The whole department admits that had they been aware, they could have intervened.&rdquo;Eight people have been suspended: the head of department, the director for mental health services, the chair of the mental health board, and five staff members.Families looking for their loved ones can call 082-809-0131, toll free number 0800-1111-17 or 011-564-2235/2215. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
