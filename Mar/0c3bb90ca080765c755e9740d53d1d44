A similar percentage thought government efforts to narrow the wealth gap were not working. With presidential and legislative elections expected in March 2018, politicians are nervously watching their backs for allegations of misbehaviour.Fatoma's passport has been seized, leaving him unable to return to Britain, a move his lawyer thinks is a deliberate strategy to wear him down.Emmanuel Saffa Abdulai said that while parliament had told the campaigner his problems would stop if he simply apologised, he advised his client to refuse."It also violates the rights of citizens to hold their elected officials accountable," Abdulai told AFP.Cyril Juxon-Smith, parliament's chief press officer, told local media that Fatoma was "recklessly casting aspersions" and had grossly overestimated funds given to MPs.Furthermore, he said, the government's own audit would give lawmakers a clean bill of health, though previous internal assessments have been far from squeaky clean. In 2015, government auditors found that just 29% of recommendations were followed by eight ministries and departments being monitored.In addition, 30% of Ebola funds under parliament's control could not be accounted for, they said, amounting to $5.7m.More than 3 500 people died in Sierra Leone during the Ebola outbreak that hit in 2014, overwhelming a creaking health system and shattering an already fragile economy.Opposition MP Frank Kposowa has claimed that demands for financial help from lawmakers meant that their allowance could barely cover costs, in spite of discounts on travel, fuel and food."The culture in Sierra Leone is that people approach you for help with their marriage and funeral ceremonies, school fees and hospital bills," he told journalists.'Absolute poverty'&nbsp;Kposowa warned that Fatoma's actions could leave him open to the charge of seditious libel, under an arcane law long used against investigative journalists and supposedly under reform.The British government has described the law's use as "denting Sierra Leone's international reputation as a modern, democratic country."A child born today in Sierra Leone can expect to live an average of 48 years, 70% of youth are unemployed or underemployed and almost two-thirds of the population live below the poverty line, according to the United Nations development agency."I believe that the absolute poverty under which the majority of Sierra Leoneans live at the moment is the greatest violation of their rights as human beings," Fatoma said. The daily grind imposed by hardship "compromises their capacity to be effective citizens and makes them vulnerable to bad governance and corruption," he added, playing down threats to his mission. "This is a lifelong commitment to make Sierra Leone a better place and nothing will stop us."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
