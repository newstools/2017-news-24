Minter-Brown challenged his dismissal.The radio station's owners, Kagiso Media, claimed he was an independent contractor, not an employee. An arbitrator ruled in his favour. Last week, the company agreed to settle the matter, and put a confidentiality agreement in place.READ: Durban radio jock gets death threats over Facebook postInterdict threatIn a Facebook post on Tuesday, Minter-Brown detailed what had happened to him and criticised management.He compared his treatment to the "punishment" meted out to another of the station's DJs, Phat Joe. Joe was suspended for a week for making comments about people with Down's Syndrome, which had resulted in an uproar from listeners.MacGregor said Minter-Browne "was expressing his frustrations with the entire episode, including his views of ECR (East Coast Radio) and Kagiso Media."Kagiso Media and East Coast Radio threatened an interdict and demanded that Kevin take the post down. He agreed to do so and considers the matter at an end."MacGregor said the parties had opposed each other robustly, but settled their differences amicably.Referring to the original comment which led to the dismissal, he said it was only through these debates that ideas could be tested and, in some instances, important changes could happen."With leaders, both locally and abroad (such as with US President Donald Trump), the disturbing trend is to muzzle the media."People and leaders must stand up and speak out for what they believe, no matter how unpopular their views may be. The only limitation should be where their words spur immediate violence. In South Africa we need to become thick-skinned and direct in regard to our problems and their solutions," MacGregor said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
