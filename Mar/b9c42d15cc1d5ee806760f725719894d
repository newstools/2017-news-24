Any other option would require a tender system to make payouts in rural areas.He also said that SARB was not involved in setting up the current system with CPS in 2012.DeductionsAnother issue highlighted by the bank was the issue of deductions.Masela said that deductions were not necessary illegal. There was scope within the law for deductions to take place, provided it was done by certified financial service providers, and all legislation was followed.He said CPS handleed deductions before grants went into bank accounts, while smaller bank Grindrod handled debit orders after net sums were deposited in bank accounts.He said it was the second type that had caused concern among beneficiaries, and it was that issue that was currently before the courts. He said the reserve bank was not privy to further details of those court cases.Committee members expressed their concern about the deductions process.Acting chairperson Hope Malgas said deductions on grants, before money is deposited, was against the law, and they "know it is not allowed".Other MPs said Grindrod's involvement needs to be scrutinised more, and that the Reserve Bank shouldn't only focus on the four big banks.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
