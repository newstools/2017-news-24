Londani Xulu, 38, was convicted and sentenced&nbsp;in the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Durban this week for both murders that were committed near Suncoast Casino and Stalwart Simelane Road in April 2016. According to police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane, Xulu committed the first murder on the morning of April 18. He said police received a complaint of a body of&nbsp;man on the M4 highway near the casino. "The body had deep injuries on the back of the head."In the second incident just over a week later on April 26, another man was found with serious injuries on Stalwart Simelane Street, Zwane said. "He was chopped with an axe on the head and taken to hospital where he later died. [An] attempted murder case was opened at Durban Central police station and it was later changed to murder."Zwane said that, following the second incident, Xulu had been traced, tracked and arrested in the Umzinyathi area, Inanda, on the same day of the killing. "An axe and a plank used in the killings were recovered, together with blood-stained clothing. The DNA results were positive on the clothing that was found and it was discovered that it is the same clothing he wore during the commission of crime."KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa, commended the investigating officers on their determination to solve the cases. "Such a criminal deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison, where he belongs. Taking another person&rsquo;s life is a heinous crime," he said.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
