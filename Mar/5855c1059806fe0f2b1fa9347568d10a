Legislation had to be passed to end this autonomy and make education a national asset."Some institutions make management decisions that exclude other students. They control access by using financial means. As a result, even those who could initially afford fees can't afford them."We must not view education as wasteful spending. We must view it as an investment into the future, something which will spark innovation in the long run."Education should only be free for those unable to afford it. Those who could pay should do so, he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
