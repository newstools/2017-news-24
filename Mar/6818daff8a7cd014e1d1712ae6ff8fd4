"It shows nobody can control Libya by force," he said, in an apparent reference to Haftar, whose critics have accused him of wanting to install a military regime in the oil-rich country.Barghathi's comments came after the Tripoli government on Friday denied any involvement in the offensive against the Oil Crescent, and condemning it as a "military escalation".Libya has been wracked by chaos since the 2011 uprising that toppled and killed longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
