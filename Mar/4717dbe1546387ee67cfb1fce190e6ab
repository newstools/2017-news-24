Just be honest, please," she later said.&nbsp;In a statement, BLF spokesperson Zanele Lwana said Zille has not shown real remorse for her "crimes"."Zille has committed the crime of racism with impunity, secured in the knowledge that the anti-black neo-colonial post-1994 settlement has served to keep whites in power,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Asked for comment, Democratic Alliance spokesperson Phumzile Van Damme said the party's position on Zille&rsquo;s tweets has not changed.&nbsp;DA leader Mmusi Maimane previously said Zille's statement does not reflect official party policy. He referred the incident to the party's internal disciplinary processes.&nbsp;The party's disciplinary chairperson Glynnis Breytenbach met with Zille on Saturday as part of her investigation.&nbsp;Breytenbach told News24 that she has written a report to the DA's federal executive to consider.&nbsp;"It is now in their hands to decide whether charges should made in which case they can refer it back to us [the disciplinary committee] to make recommendations on the charges," she said.&nbsp;Breytenbach could confirm whether a date has been set for the federal executive to consider her report.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
