He said the 141-year-old newspaper was mismanaged and had better remember that "we finance it."Al-Ahram's Wednesday edition said Abdel-Al's criticism was inappropriate and condescending and that he should double check his facts.Separately, Abdel-Al said this week that he plans to sue the editor of an independent daily for defamation of the legislature, a 596-seat chamber packed with government supporters.The editor of Al-Maqal, Ibrahim Issa, is among few opposition voices left in the mostly pro-government media.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
