Side companies linked to CPS were offering recipients loans against the grant money it was paying out.The Constitutional Court had ruled that certain deductions were no longer permitted, like the funeral policies taken from children's grants.On Thursday, residents gathered outside Sassa&rsquo;s offices at the Portlands centre.They said they were routinely short-changed and, when they queried it, officials sent them to a police station to open a case.'They send you from place to place'Johanna Jacobs, 78, said she was paid R20 short every month and had not been able to get it paid back."They send you from place to place all day," said protester Sumaya Smith. She looks after her aged mother, who needs R1 500 a month to live on.Smith said her mother only received R1 000.The security guard refused to get information for those waiting outside the centre. He refused to call a centre manager.After about 15 minutes, a CPS official emerged, asked what the reporter's business was, and explained that the security was necessary to protect cash on the premises.On Thursday, a Sassa pay point in Bonteheuwel was reportedly robbed.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
