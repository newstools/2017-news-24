The ANCYL has targeted the mall because it says the mall does not prioritise local labour and this marginalises the economy of the area.&nbsp;There were around 120 ANCYL demonstrators gathered by mid-morning. The ANCYL in the greater KwaDukuza region said it expected 10&nbsp;000 people to join the march after it sought permission from the local municipality. Speaking to News24, demonstrator Angel Khumalo said she wanted a chance at a job and to provide for her family. "Today is hot. I am here because I only want to work and help my family. We do not have anything. We are living a hard life."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
