It has major negative repercussions for the future and the sustainability of the institution if we cannot continue with the aspirant programme," Abrahams told the committee.They would not be able to sustain the NPA without the aspirant programme, the committee was told.The NPA also presented its targets for the year, which were questioned for being "too low" in some instances.These included targets for cybercrime prosecution, and corruption related crimes. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
