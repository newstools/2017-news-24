Sassa says in the papers that between March 1 and March 3 it held negotiations with CPS and an agreement was reached in principle but was subject to approval&nbsp;from Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini and National Treasury.The heads of arguments come after stern questions from the Constitutional Court last week and applications by several non-governmental organisations concerned about an impending crisis on April 1, a day after the CPS contract ends. The current contract with CPS was declared unlawful and invalid in 2014 after it was found that the tender process was irregular.Also read:&nbsp;ConCourt's stern questions to Sassa over grants24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
