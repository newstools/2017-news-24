Mahlatse Gallens, Mpho Raborife, News24 Sassa head office.

He was acting Sassa CEO between March 8 and 12. Efforts to provide the court with answers were made during his brief tenure.He acted in the position after current CEO Thokozani Magwaza went on sick leave.News24 understands Magwaza refused to sign the affidavit submitted on Monday night.In his affidavit, Magasela suggests the crisis in the project was partly because of the many changes in Sassa's leadership after the court's 2014 ruling.Leadership changesSassa CEO Virginia Petersen's term ended on May 14, 2016. Raphaahle Ramokgopa acted in the position until October 31 that year. Then Magwaza, who was the director-general in the department, was permanently appointed in November.The court wanted to know why it was not immediately informed of the change of plan.Magasela says in his affidavit that Sassa accepts responsibility for not informing the court, but it does not assign blame to any particular individual.He accepts that the court ought to have been informed much earlier that the agency could not meet its deadline.The department only filed a progress report with the Constitutional Court on March 3, five months after advocate Wim Trengove, SC, advised it to make a full disclosure to the court of its change of plan."It (Sassa) is no longer under any formal duty to do so, but in our view its radical departure from the plan placed before the courts by its report of 5 November 2015 requires that Sassa disclose to the Constitutional Court that it proposes to enter into a further agreement with CPS," Trengove wrote in a legal opinion in October.Sassa admits the only way to ensure no interruption of grant payments is for CPS to continue with its agreement. It will need approval from Dlamini and Treasury.Sassa's negotiations with CPS earlier this month had to be terminated when an inter-ministerial task team rejected its interim agreement with the company.On Tuesday morning, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan told Parliament's standing committee on public accounts that the department was working on the matter.Sassa submitted to the court that the Public Protector and Auditor General could oversee the terms of an interim contract with CPS and its implementation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
