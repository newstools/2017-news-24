There were instances where the police clobbered defenceless Nigerians to death on suspicion of being involved in criminality."Nigeria lawmakers reportedly accused the Nigerian government of not "doing enough" to protect Nigerians in the southern African country. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
