The EFF reacted to AfriForum&rsquo;s letter and threatened that they will take land without any compensation and that the land will be redistributed.&ldquo;This remark is in direct violation of the Constitution as well as international law. It is a violation of the owners&rsquo; rights and therefore AfriForum together with AfriBusiness obtained the court interdict,&rdquo; Cooks said.Cooks added that AfriBusiness viewed private land ownership as &ldquo;one of the cornerstones of a flourishing economy that is based on the free-market system&rdquo;. Armand Greyling, Law and Policy Analyst for AfriBusiness said any threat or undermining of private land ownership would deter local and international investors &ldquo;and lead to the flow of capital out of the country&rdquo;.&ldquo;Should Malema or a member of the EFF not adhere to this interdict&sbquo; they will be charged with contempt of court&sbquo;&rdquo; added Cooks. The EFF could not be immediately reached for comment.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
