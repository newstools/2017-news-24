Cheetah surveys are notoriously hard to carry out. The numbers of these elusive animals across Africa are declining as their habitat shrinks.Two Belgian Malinois sniffer dogs were used to detect cheetah scat in the remote Liuwa&ndash;Mussuma Transfrontier Conservation Area, the paper says. Both dogs had already been used in scat detection of 15 species in four countries. Before they started this project, the dogs got special training on wild cheetah scat. The scats the dogs found were analysed in the Zoological Society of London's genetics laboratory, the paper says.The result?During the 3-week survey, the dogs found 50 scats. Working with these (and other samples) researchers were finally able to come up with an estimate for the cheetah population size and density in the area."Our study demonstrates the efficacy of detection dog survey methods in providing information on cheetah across large landscapes," said the authors.Read more about the study here.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
