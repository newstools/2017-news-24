A community news website, the Springs Advertiser, reported that shots rang out after the ribbon-cutting ceremony. Netcare 911 spokesperson Chris Botha said there had apparently been a cash-in-transit robbery. One of the injured was airlifted to a local hospital. The mall’s marketing manager, Amoret D’Arrigo, said in a statement that seven suspects posing as workers entered an area under construction at the mall, and stole goods from the Incredible Connection store. D’Arrigo said nobody was in the store at the time. "We have extensive security measures in place for opening day and beyond. This includes state-of-the-art CCTV and vehicle number plate recognition, which is connected to the number plate network security initiative, in partnership with the SAPS," D’Arrigo said.
