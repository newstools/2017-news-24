We have to postpone the matter for the DNA test to deal with the matter of kidnapping."Dakela said if it was found that Mbokazi was the father, the charge would fall away. He said he did not feel Mbokazi could be accused of hijacking."The charge of hijacking will fall away because the lady voluntarily handed the child over to my client. From where I stand there is nothing further than this logical explanation."The judge ordered that Mbambo and Mbokazi remain in custody until their next appearance.The baby was found alive early on Sunday morning. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
