Dating, drugs and other activities are increasingly taking place in local cemeteries, Mpumalanga police say.&nbsp;&ldquo;The cemeteries are the main cause of crime in Pienaar, ranging from rape to robbery," Pienaar police spokesman Captain Jabu Ndubane said."There are two schools and learners are bunking classes to hide, smoke drugs, damage tombstones and get involved in sexual activities in the cemetery.&rdquo;Zenzile Baloyi, of Msogwaba next to the Tekwane cemetery, said it had become a &ldquo;dating zone&rdquo; for schoolchildren and other people. It had become a devilish place because of the crime and shameful activities, she said.&ldquo;I chased away learners after seeing them having sex on top of one grave. I was so shocked and asked myself, don&rsquo;t these people know our roots when it comes to cemeteries and dead people?&rdquo;Another local, Amos Ndlovu said he wanted the cemetery fenced in.&ldquo;We now fear for our lives because this area is very dangerous. I heard that those culprits use the cemeteries to target woman passing by so they can rape them.&rdquo;After many arrests related to unlawful incidents in cemeteries, Ndubane called on Pienaar and Kanyamazane residents to clean up and clear away bushes in the cemeteries.According to the 2016 Annual Crime Statistics, cases of robbery with aggravating circumstances and sexual offences increased in the province compared to the previous year.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
