Officials of the Western Cape department of social development say in a statement they strongly condemn the disruption of services, intimidation and unruly behaviour by Nehawu members who prevented service delivery at the Mitchell s Plain local office last week.On Thursday last week, about 50 Nehawu union members barged into the local office which also houses the Sassa offices. Albert Fritz, provincial minister for social development, says in a statement: The group allegedly proceeded to intimidate the majority of non-striking officials, who were going about their duties, and aggressively forced them out of the building. The group further proceeded to chase out residents who had come seeking help at the office. The illegal strikers then caused a hostage situation after they forcefully chained and locked remaining staff inside, and blockaded the entrances. This protest action was illegal, as the national department of social development had obtained a court interdict against Nehawu. The offices were then closed for the rest of the day. Normal function has now resumed.Fritz says the department will take disciplinary action against those involved .24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
