The latch of the door was broken when neighbours tried to stop the attack, he testified.Poni had a protection order against her husband, although they were still living in the same house.Nomala said the post-mortem found a sexual act had occurred before Poni's death. Police believed he raped her.Poni&rsquo;s husband, a project administrator, previously told the court he would plead guilty, with reasons, but elected to remain silent on the merits of the case.At the start of his bail application, he told Magistrate Goolam Bawa that he stabbed his wife on January 2, but claimed he had not been told she had died of her wounds.Police arrested him at a home nearby.Nomala said he had changed his pants. Witnesses claimed his relatives had taken them to be washed. He, however, had no affidavit or statement to support this.Nomala told the court he opposed the suspect&rsquo;s bail application because he was a danger to himself and the community, who were angered by his wife's violent death.In the 13 years he had been a detective, he said he had never seen such a case.The bail application continues on Wednesday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
