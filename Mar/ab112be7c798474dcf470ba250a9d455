Gbagbo is on trial for crimes against humanity, including murder, rape and persecution, having been handed over in November 2011 to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague.The ICC also wanted to prosecute his wife and issued a warrant for her arrest, but Ivorian authorities refused to hand her over, insisting she would receive a fair trial at home.Some 3 000 people died in five months of unrest in the cocoa-rich west African republic after Laurent Gbagbo refused to accept the result of presidential elections in 2010.Yeo said Simone headed a crisis cell - "a genuine decision-making body" that allegedly coordinated attacks by armed forces and pro-Gbagbo militias.The evidence came from documents found in at the home of the presidential couple when the pair were arrested on September 11, 2011, he said."She replied to correspondence from arms dealers offering weapons and combat helicopters," said Yeo.She is accused of distributing arms to militias backing her husband following his election defeat.In one case, she allegedly played an indirect role in the shelling of a market in Abobo, a Ouattara stronghold in the capital Abidjan, in November 2010.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
