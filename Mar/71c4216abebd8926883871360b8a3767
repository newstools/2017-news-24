He is just as worried."Viljoen had testified that he had packs of notes with information that he had sent in which he expressed his concerns."But maybe the answer is that they didn&rsquo;t want us to investigate at that time," he had said.Asked who he meant by "they", Viljoen replied, "Fivaz them".He was referring to then-national police commissioner George Fivaz.Tried to destabilise 1994 electionsViljoen testified that if the murder plot investigation was so important and it was known he was probing it, it was "a good excuse" to then use the Mandela-mandated Palazzolo probe to divert him.After Lincoln's arrest, Viljoen was ordered to probe Palazzolo.Palazzolo, who at one point lived in SA, was arrested in Thailand in 2012 as he was travelling back to SA.He is now jailed in Italy where in 2009 he was sentenced in absentia to nine years' imprisonment for having an association with the mafia.Viljoen had testified that information had previously surfaced about senior police officers and that they tried to destabilise the first democratic elections in 1994."It looked as if information was obtained that someone, a sharpshooter, would shoot President Mandela at his inauguration."With the information we got, we established that the firearm to be used, was in a certain office of [the] organised crime [unit]."Viljoen had testified that information about the firearm was correct as the rifle was seized in a secret office of the unit in Pretoria.At the time, he said he hoped the matter would be investigated further.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
