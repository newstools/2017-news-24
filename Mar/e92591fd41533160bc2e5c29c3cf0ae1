A picture shows graffitis painted on the "Triumphs and Laments" frescoe which was completed along the banks of Rome s Tiber river less than a year ago by South African artist William Kentridge.

I'm less interested in those who simply leave their initials on the wall," Kentridge told Italian daily La Repubblica."I know there are many people in Rome to whom this work is dear... out of respect for them, I hope the city authorities will clean up the graffiti," he said.The message appeared to have been heard. Deputy mayor Luca Bergamo on Friday ordered a team from the city's refuse department to start erasing the graffiti, denouncing the authors of it as "stupid."Slave galleyEntitled "Triumphs and Laments", Kentridge's 10m tall mural was created by washing the dirt off the wall around the images in a technique known as reverse stencilling.The artist expects it to gradually disappear as pollution and weeds combine to return the cleaned bits of wall to their previous state, a process that he had envisaged taking four to five years.The frieze provides a non-chronological depiction of Rome's history from pre-historic times up to the Dolce Vita era of the 1960s and the contemporary migrant crisis - which is referenced in a depiction of a Roman slave galley. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
