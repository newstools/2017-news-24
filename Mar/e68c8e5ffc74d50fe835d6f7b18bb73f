Military intelligence conducted surveillance of Palazzolo's son's wedding," Lincoln, said.He did, however, add that he had discussed the investigations he was working on with Ricky Nkondo of the NIA as he knew him well.Lincoln testified that Smith's allegations against him, which he only recently read when preparing for the trial before the court, were effectively a form of sabotage."It's very clear that Mr Smith maliciously went out of his way [to attack] my personal character," he said.The case continues on Wednesday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
