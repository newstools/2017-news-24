He gave no details.Previous attempts at peace, under pressure from the international community, have failed, and a number of South Sudan government and military officials recently resigned while warning of ethnic abuses.The UN has warned of ethnic cleansing in South Sudan, which has been devastated by three years of civil war. Last month, the secretary-general's adviser on genocide renewed his warning that indicators for genocide were in place.The UN commission's new report said violations have mainly been committed by South Sudan's security forces including the army, which is dominated by members of Kiir's Dinka ethnic group.Tens of thousands have been killed in the civil war, and more than 1.5 million people have fled the country. The UN and South Sudan's government recently declared famine in two counties as the upheaval has disrupted cultivation and markets.Guterres came to East Africa this week to witness Somalia's deadly drought crisis.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
