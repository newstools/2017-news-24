The matter was previously postponed because Qwelane was not well.In April 2011, the Johannesburg Equality Court found him guilty of hate speech for his column. He was ordered to apologise and fined R100 000. He was not present at the default judgment because of his job abroad. The judgment was withdrawn on September 1, 2011.Qwelane's counsel argued at the time that the default judgment was not allowed, and that a direction hearing needed to be convened before such a judgment could be handed down.In August 2013, the court heard that Qwelane intended challenging the constitutionality of certain sections of the Equality Act.The SAHRC later initiated proceedings against him again.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
