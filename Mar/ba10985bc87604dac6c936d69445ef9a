Last year, scientists recorded the Earth's hottest temperatures in modern times for the third year in a row.Nations agreed in Paris in 2015 to limit average global warming to 2&deg;C over pre-industrial temperatures.That is the level at which many scientists say humankind can still avoid worst-case climate outcomes in terms of rising sea levels, worsening droughts and floods, and increasingly violent superstorms."Climate change is visible proof that our actions can have a ripple effect beyond physical borders," Das said."It is up to each of us to ensure the impact we create helps instead to improve the lives of those around us and elsewhere, at present and in the future."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
