His family member, seeing this, went out to sea to save him and managed to, but in the process, got swept away by the tide. When we arrived, he [the rescued man] was already out of the water. He was very emotional when paramedics arrived at the scene," said ER24 Spokesperson Annine Dormehl.Dormehl encouraged people to get as much help as possible before trying to help others in the sea, especially during high tide."We always encourage people to swim in places where they feel safe.
