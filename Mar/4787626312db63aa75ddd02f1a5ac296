KwaZulu-Natal DA caucus leader Zwakele Mncwango made the appeal to Gumede this week. He said on Thursday that the matter should be tabled at the eThekwini Municipality's next executive committee meeting on Tuesday.Mncwango said Sport and Recreation Minister Fikile Mbalula had already lamented the high cost of the event and the fact that no budget agreement had been made."I don't want to raise your expectations and say everything looks good - it doesn't. We are unable to agree on the fundamentals," timeslive.co.za quoted Mbalula as saying in Cape Town on February 28.Mncwango cited the economic growth challenges in the city and country, and eThekwini's basic services backlog."As the current leadership of the city, we need to be honest with ourselves and the ratepayers of Durban. The city cannot afford to host this expensive event."The city needed to decide between needs and wants, he said.City spokesperson Mthunzi Gumede said the mayor had yet to see the DA's letter and would respond once she had received it. "She will not be responding to him through the media. It is unfortunate that the DA chose to use the media to engage the mayor."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
