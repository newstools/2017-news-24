Last year it contributed more than $2bn, representing about 24% of WFP's total budget, Orr said.UN operations in South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and Nigeria will require more than $5.6bn this year, he said.At least $4.4bn is needed by the end of March to avert a catastrophe, he said, but so far the UN has only received $90m."The more dramatic cuts in any aid budgets, the more the number of debts, the more suffering there is going to be," Orr said."We have a situation where famine has been declared in two counties in Unity state in South Sudan. That means there are already people dying in those places. This has been caused by a combination of factors including conflict, which prevents access. Humanitarian intervention is very difficult. Huge numbers of people are displaced," Orr said. "Now famine is threatening in other parts of South Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria and Yemen."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
