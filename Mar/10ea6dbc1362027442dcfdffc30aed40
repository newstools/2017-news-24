The Department is clearly falling apart."Godi said the committee is now looking forward to its meeting with Dlamini on Tuesday."It is now becoming very difficult to explain the capability of the Minister to effectively run the Department and discharge of her responsibilities."Scopa cannot be quiet or indifferent to these levels of mismanagement which create unease and anxiety in the nation, and comes at a huge financial cost to the State.Godi tweeted on Saturday that Dangor had only been in the position since November, and that somebody else should have resigned, "not this honest man".'Breakdown in relations'Dangor confirmed to News24 on Saturday that he tendered his resignation on Friday.He said it was essentially a breakdown in the relations between himself and the minister over disagreements on Sassa's legal obligations to the Constitutional Court.He did not want to comment on whether he thought he had been treated unfairly on the Sassa matter.National Treasury on Friday said it cannot intervene in the negotiations with Cash Paymaster Services for the extension of the distribution contract of social grants.Treasury also said the procurement responsibility should be the responsibility of the accounting officer of the respective department, which in this case was the director general.The portfolio committee on social development on Wednesday, however, heard that acting Sassa CEO Thamo Mzobe had been put in charge of the three-day negotiations with CPS.Department spokesperson Lumka Oliphant could not be reached after multiple attempts on Saturday morning.Dangor was appointed director general in November 2016, after his predecessor left the department.He had been special adviser to the minister before that since 2010, according to the department's website.The DG of Social Development resigns over the SASSA debacle.
