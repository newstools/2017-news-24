They will be paid, but the manner in which it will be done may not be legal," ANC national spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said.The portfolio committee on social development has apologised for its role in the crisis which it said could lead to beneficiaries not being paid."If the process is stalled, we will be the first to know. We wish to offer our apology as a committee for the crisis which threatens to destroy the lifeline of our own," chairperson Rose Capa said last week. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
