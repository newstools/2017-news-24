Raupach's abduction was initially claimed by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb to which Ansaru has been linked. He was killed during a military raid in Kano, northern Nigeria, in May 2012.The other kidnapping and murder charges relate to seven foreign nationals - two from Lebanon, two Syrians, an Italian, a Greek and a Briton - who were seized in the northern state of Bauchi in 2013.Ansaru also claimed responsibility for the kidnapping.According to the charge sheet, the seven were taken to the Sambisa Forest area of Borno state, in northeastern Nigeria, and held for about 10 days before they were killed.They were then buried in a shallow grave, the charge read.Halima Haliru, Barnawi's second wife, faces only one charge - failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism.Nigeria's military announced in April last year that Barnawi was arrested in the capital of Kogi state, in central Nigeria, and described him as "on top of the list of our wanted terrorists".The group, also known as Jamaatu Ansarul Muslimina Fi Biladissudan ("Vanguard for the Aid of Muslims in Black Africa"), specialised in high-profile killings and attacks on foreigners.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
