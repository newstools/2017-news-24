Experts could also suffer reputational damage if the public tore their performances to shreds.The legal representative for Van Breda's sister Marli, Advocate Louise Buikman, also stressed to Desai the importance of shielding her from the media glare.Buikman told News24 on the side-lines that two orders had already been granted to protect Marli's privacy.No media interviewsShe survived the axe attack in her family's home with serious injuries and was left with amnesia after her physical recovery.Orders granted in June 2015 and October 2016 already stipulated that no media may interview or photograph her without the consent of her curator.The media should also exercise care when reporting about her and her curator is the only person who can liaise with the media.On Friday, Desai said he was sure the media would be careful around her.He would consider adding conditions relating to her in his order in Monday.Van Breda faces three counts of murder, one of attempted murder, and one of obstructing the course of justice.His parents, Martin, 54, and Teresa, 55, and his brother Rudi, 22, were killed with an axe in their home on the luxury De Zalze golf estate in Stellenbosch in the early hours of Tuesday, January 27, 2015.* News24 is part of 24.com, a subsidiary of Media24 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
