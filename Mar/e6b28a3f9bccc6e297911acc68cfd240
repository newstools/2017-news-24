The pair moves around the play area and at some point can&rsquo;t be seen by the camera.&nbsp; Mabuya&rsquo;s daughter then emerges and walks out of the play area with Viljoen&rsquo;s daughter close behind, but she doesn&rsquo;t exit the room.&nbsp; Mabuya&rsquo;s daughter returns and the two girls continue playing, again moving out of camera view. They emerge again and exit the play area with neither looking distressed. No child minder appears to be present.&nbsp; This week Mabuya said she wasn&rsquo;t certain what happened in the play area. She said her daughter told her that a girl had pinched her in the play area.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told her to move to a different side and not pay attention to that girl. She came back again, saying the girl didn&rsquo;t want them playing with anything in the area and was bothering them.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told her to sit down, but after a while she went back. She returned again saying the girl had slapped her and she had hit her back,&rdquo; Mabuya said.&nbsp; Mabuya said she doesn&rsquo;t know what the truth was. &ldquo;In fact, I don&rsquo;t want to know because I am tired of this whole thing,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; She said had no idea the video she posted on social media would go viral. &ldquo;The reality hit me on Tuesday when calls started coming in. With each call, I was left thinking what [the incident] had done to my kids, who witnessed such hate and profanity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mabuya, a nurse by profession, said the incident affected her 10-year-old son.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I come back from work later than usual, he asks me if the white guy from the restaurant had come for me. When I tell him no, he says he is scared that he will come to my workplace and assault me.&rdquo;&nbsp; She said she had not taken her child for counselling. However, if he continued being withdrawn, she would take him to a psychologist.&nbsp; Spur has offered to pay for counselling for Mabuya and all the children who witnessed the violent incident.&nbsp; In cellphone video footage that went viral last week, Viljoen confronted Mabuya, demanding she discipline her child who had, according to him, hit his daughter. At the time, Mabuya was dining with several children.&nbsp; When Mabuya brushed him off, he grabbed the little girl&rsquo;s arm and pulled her towards him. Mabuya moved quickly to pull the child back. She stood up and the two argued and swore at each other, with Viljoen threatening to physically assault her.&nbsp; He then walked away, but immediately returned after Mabuya continued to swear at him. On his return, he lifted and shook the table, spilling food and drinks on the children and Mabuya&rsquo;s sister, who was seated at the other end of the table.&nbsp; Despite many people supporting Mabuya for standing up to Viljoen, she wasn&rsquo;t proud of what happened.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t approve of the language I used. I felt cornered and had to stand up for my children because this man was bullying us,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I had sat and not responded, I would have failed my children because they would think that&rsquo;s how people should behave towards them and they should accept it,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; Efforts to reach Viljoen were fruitless. His phone was switched off and his social-media account was shut down.
