"The sad news is that the whole area needs to be cleaned up, the sewers and market should be moved."Ramses II ruled Egypt more than 3 000 years ago and was a great builder whose effigy can be seen at a string of archaeological sites across the country.Massive statues of the warrior-king can be seen in Luxor, and his most famous monument is found in Abu Simbel, near Sudan.Osman said that the massive head removed from the ground was made in the style that Ramses was depicted, and was likely him. The site contained parts of both that statue and another.Egypt is packed with ancient treasures, many of which still remain buried. The sites open to tourists are often empty of late as the country has suffered from political instability that has scared off foreigners since its Arab Spring uprising in 2011.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
