What are you doing to ensure that it belongs to all youth of South Africa?&rdquo; Rawula asked.Radebe disputed that all seven board members selected were affiliated to the ANCYL. One of them, he said, was part of the Inkatha Freedom Party Youth Brigade, he said.&ldquo;I have no reason to believe that the process was not fair.&rdquo;He said the board&rsquo;s members came from a wide geographic spread and almost all provinces were represented.The EFF again raised issues with the lack of academic qualifications of some of the seven members, who were selected after a long process in Parliament.&ldquo;Do you, as a possible presidential candidate for the ANC, think it&rsquo;s rational to have people without proper qualifications on the board?&rdquo; EFF MP Floyd Shivambu asked.He said chartered accountants and advocates had been overlooked in favour of ANC members.In response, Radebe read out the qualifications of the board members. One had completed one year in finance at university.&ldquo;I can go on and on,&rdquo; he said.Seven candidates were nominated to serve on the NYDA board for three years. They are Ndumiso Thokozani Mokako, Itiseng Kenneth Morolong, Yershen Pillay, Sifiso John Mtsweni, Zandile Majozi, Bavelile Gloria Hlongwa, and Khomotjo Joy Maimela.Their nomination is awaiting approval from the presidency. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
