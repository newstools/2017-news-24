''This sends a positive message to the public about driving while under the influence of alcohol and should serve as a reminder to motorists that drunk driving will not be tolerated as it puts the lives of motorists and pedestrians at risk,'' DA MP Zakhele Mbhele said. He congratulated law enforcement officers who had acted against Yengeni, saying it proved they would act without fear or favour to protect motorists. Lobby group the Justice Alliance of SA felt Yengeni should also have had his licence suspended. He received a sentence of a R30 000 fine or 90 days in jail. Half of the fine and jail term were suspended for five years. Alliance chairperson Howard Dembovsky said he expected the Road Traffic Management Corporation and transport minister to vilify Magistrate Grant Engel for not cancelling Yengeni's driver's licence. They had apparently done so in December 2016, when a KwaZulu-Natal magistrate fined a speeding, but sober motorist R40 000. The RTMC and minister had said the man's licence should have been cancelled and not just suspended for a year. In the Yengeni matter, Engel said he did not see the point of suspending Yengeni's licence because he had enough money to hire a driver to take him around.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
