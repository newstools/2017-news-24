All the information that [you] have is just about all the information that we have," said Mogoeng.But when pushed by News24 on details such as the number of suspects that were caught on the building's state-of-the-art CCTV camera systems, as well as the burglars' point of entry into the premises, Mogoeng conceded that he'd been briefed and that he was privy to that information."I've been briefed about the entry point, [the] CCTV cameras, but I'm not too sure if it is not going to compromise the investigations to divulge that," said Mogoeng.SuspectsHe added that his office had been asked by police not to share information on the robbery with the public that may compromise the ongoing investigation.Nkosinathi Msimango, 34, the alleged mastermind behind the break-in, appeared in the Randburg Magistrate's Court on Friday for a formal bail application.Msimango has repeatedly denied that he has any knowledge of the crime or the whereabouts of the 15 stolen computers thought to contain sensitive information on judges, magistrates and other court officials.News24 asked Mogoeng whether the arrest of Msimango and two other suspects linked to the case was cause for relief for the Office of the Chief Justice."I can't say I'm relieved, they are only suspects and nobody knows what is going to come out of the case," responded the Chief Justice.Msimango's bail application is set to continue on Monday.* Do you have information for our investigative journalists?
