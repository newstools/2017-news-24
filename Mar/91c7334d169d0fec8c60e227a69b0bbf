Five of his staff were also ordered to be remanded in custody.On March 3, the country's chief prosecutor, Serigne Bassirou Gueye, said a judicial investigation would be opened against Sall over the alleged misappropriation of 1.83 billion CFA francs ($2.85m) in city funds.Sall, a rebel member of the Socialist Party, part of the country's ruling coalition, who had been seen as a probable contender in the 2019 presidential elections, has claimed a plot may be under way to remove him from running."This arrest and detention is only to stop Khalifa Sall in his political ambitions," his lawyers said in a statement read to the press in court, referring to July legislative elections and the 2019 presidential polls.Sall has repeatedly denied any malfeasance after a government monitor published a report raising a flag about missing funds.Senegal is widely seen as one of Africa's most stable democracies.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
