An investigation into the alleged assault, at the Sentrarand facility, on Thursday was underway, corporate affairs executive manager Zodwa Mashishi said. The United National Transport Union (Untu) said the guard was not seriously injured. Untu deputy general secretary, Eddie de Klerk, said they were relieved to have heard that he was discharged from hospital on the same day. He said he was not sure if the guard had opened a case with police, and that the union wanted to help him. Untu was glad that Transnet suspended the manager pending an internal investigation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
