A date had not yet been set.Vearey, former deputy provincial commissioner for detective services; and Jacobs, who headed the Western Cape&rsquo;s Crime Intelligence unit, were effectively demoted in June last year.Vearey was shifted to a position he previously filled - commander of the Cape Town cluster of police stations, while Jacobs was appointed Wynberg cluster commander.They had been involved in several high-profile investigations.With the help of the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union, they approached the courts to have the decision reviewed.It emerged at their last appearance in December that there was seemingly no trace of documents informing them of their sudden redeployment.They had asked for minutes of meetings and/or deliberations by the SA Police Service and its top officials in the time leading up to the transfers.The respondents include the police minister, acting national police commissioner, Western Cape police commissioner, and SAPS.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
