The billboard must not be lifted down, but, burnt down," he said on his Facebook page at the time.One person commented: "We can't burn it down as it is pasted against an apartment block, people inside the apartment will burn to death. We can remove it though."Mkongi responded with: "They must burn to death as it is life for them to keep it that way."He later apologised and said this was an error of judgement.Dipuo Letsatsi-DubaMeanwhile, NEC member and Western Cape caretaker Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba has been appointed as the new deputy minister of public service and administration.Zuma announced a reshuffle of his Cabinet on Thursday night, ending weeks of speculation over his sacking of ministers.Letsatsi-Duba also chairs the public enterprises committee in Parliament.She was sent to the Western Cape to help clean up when provincial chairperson Marius Fransman and secretary Faiez Jacobs were suspended.She was deployed to the office of the chairperson in the Western Cape.The fairly unknown Letsatsi-Duba joined the ANC in the 1980s, and was a member of uMkhonto weSizwe (MK), according to her profile.Born and raised in Gauteng, the new minister has experience in communications, having been a media liaison officer in the ANC in the early 1990s.In 2007, she was elected to serve on Limpopo's provincial executive committee and as provincial treasurer of the ANC in 2008.Earlier on Thursday, Zuma convened a meeting of the ANC&rsquo;s top six, which preceded the announcement.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
