You must go."IFP MP Mkhuleko Hlengwa had the most fiery of debates, being interrupted multiple times by ANC MPs on frivolous points of order.He said the minister has aided and abetted the crisis for three years. He said Sassa lied to the court&nbsp;when&nbsp;saying they had the capacity to deal with the matter, but now they don't."The minister is no longer fit for purpose."'As guilty as the minister'FF Plus MP Pieter Mulder said that, as Dlamini sat there in the House, she was in contempt of court.He called the ANC caucus useless, and compared the caucus's defence of Dlamini to its defence of President Jacob Zuma during the Nkandla saga in Parliament.ANC MP and social development portfolio committee chairperson Rose Capa defended Dlamini and the ANC.She said the country's past caused many black South Africans to be under-educated, without jobs and dependent on social grants.Capa said the department was trying to rectify the mistakes, but opposition MPs are trying to come up with new options instead of allowing them to work.Agang SA MP Andries Plouamma said they should not take Capa seriously, as she is "as guilty as the minister".He said Capa was serving as a security guard to protect the minister. Plouamma said Dlamini was the worst minister ever produced by the ANC.APC MP and Scopa chairperson Themba Godi said the minister and Sassa must be held personally responsible for the "well-orchestrated ruse".He said the scheme must be given to the Post Office, as it is a public institution.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
