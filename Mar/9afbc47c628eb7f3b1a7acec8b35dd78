She instead deals with public spats and Letsoalo's removal specifically. She doesn't refer to anything else," he said.Unterhalter argued that the board, independent of Letsoalo, had developed a turnaround strategy for Prasa."It's just a blatant case of a minister who is not being fair," he added.He argued that the matter should be considered as urgent by the courts because the board's term would end in July.Unterhalter told the court that there was no reason the board would not work with Peters."The board can work with the minister. There is no reason why it should not be a working relationship."'Blatant unlawful conduct'Molefe's founding affidavit, filed on Saturday, said the decision to remove the board members and the notices of removal are "plainly unlawful and must be set aside" to prevent irremediable damage, uphold legality and vindicate public interest.Peters' "blatant unlawful conduct and failure to reverse course or engage with the applicants timeously" warranted a punitive costs order, Molefe's court papers read.Molefe sat in the front row in court listening attentively to arguments on Friday.During intervals, he engaged with journalists and legal representatives.Judge Peter Mabuse reserved judgment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
