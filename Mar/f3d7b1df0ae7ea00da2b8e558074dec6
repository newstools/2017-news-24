But Lungisa will not accept his marching orders, saying his situation &ldquo;is unique&rdquo;.&ldquo;The issue of the Nelson Mandela region is different from others because here we are on a revolutionary cause to reclaim the metro [from the DA],&rdquo; said Lungisa.&ldquo;Even if there existed a clause that prohibits a member from doing what I did, we are a liberation movement and, in this case, there would have been an exception to the rule. There are exceptions to every rule,&rdquo; he said.He said members cannot be expected to succumb to everything said by leadership, by virtue of their being leadership.&ldquo;I sit in the constitutional amendments in all conferences of the ANC, so it is unlikely that I can misinterpret the constitution,&rdquo; explained Lungisa.He said each rule in the constitution must be read together with other related rules for proper context.&ldquo;We must assess what kind of leaders are needed in each space and not limit the local needs only to issues of rules. In political terms, what do you say in a case where the membership say this is the kind of leadership to take this region forward?&ldquo;Surely you cannot open a book of rules in that case. You must analyse the situation in political terms,&rdquo; he stated.Lungisa has a trump card up his sleeve, in the name of the respected Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, whom he said he would call on to defend his cause when the need arose. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
