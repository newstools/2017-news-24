They were given a deadline of Monday at 16:00 to provide answers.Failed to meet deadlineDlamini and Sassa failed to meet the deadline to answer the court's questions about when Sassa knew it would be unable to take over the grants payments, when its contract with CPS expires on March 31.The Constitutional Court on Tuesday issued a new directive to Sassa and Dlamini to explain why they missed the deadline to respond to its questions. Dlamini missed this deadline as well by several minutes.In 2014, the court ruled that the contract with CPS was illegal and invalid. It suspended the order of invalidity until March 31 this year to allow the department and Sassa to insource the administrative requirements to distribute grants.A task team of Cabinet ministers has rejected a proposed extension of Sassa&rsquo;s contract with CPS.SAPO has also joined the scramble to replace CPS as the country's social grants distributor amid the ongoing crisis over the payment of beneficiaries.CEO Mark Barnes submitted an affidavit dated March 13 to the Constitutional Court as part of the Post Office's application to be admitted as a friend of the court in the Black Sash vs Sassa matter.In the court papers, Barnes states that using the Post Office would "serve the national interest, protect beneficiaries' information and support government's ambitions for radical socio-economic transformation".Barnes has proposed two alternative systems to solve the crisis, including one that could be implemented within days. However, another long-term plan would need to include CPS.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
