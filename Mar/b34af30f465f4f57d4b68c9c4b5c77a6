Without land, people have no wealth and as such we believe that our call for economic freedom in our lifetime cannot be championed outside the struggle for our land," he said.Mshengu said they wanted the harshest punishment imposed on banks implicated in the alleged manipulation of foreign currency trading. &nbsp;"To design a process with the intention to cripple the currency of the state is nothing but to undermine the effectiveness of the state," he said.The league intended mobilising provincial government departments, municipalities, and ANC supporters to bank with Ithala Bank.Sabelo added that "those who stole the land" must volunteer to give it back."It was stolen land. They must just hand it back without compensation."He said the EFF's call for land restitution was merely a political stunt."If the ANC raises that motion in Parliament, the EFF will not support it," Sabelo said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
