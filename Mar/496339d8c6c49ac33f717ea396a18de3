This was due to the &ldquo;unprecedented nature and widespread concern&rdquo; about the reshuffle, the foundation said in a statement.Zuma announced on Thursday night that he was appointing 10 new ministers and 10 new deputy ministers. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas were among those who lost their jobs.Under normal circumstances Zuma would not have to explain changes to the executive.&ldquo;However both the extent of the Cabinet reshuffle and the circumstances in which it has occurred are not normal,&rdquo; the former president&rsquo;s foundation said.They had no doubt that Zuma and the ANC leadership understood they were accountable to the people of South Africa.&ldquo;It is therefore imperative that President Zuma and the rest of the ANC leadership use the occasion of today&rsquo;s major Cabinet reshuffle constructively to respond to the existing serious public concern and unease about the state of the nation, which could result in major and very serious social instability if it is not addressed honestly and properly,&rdquo; the foundation said.&nbsp;The foundation respected the fact that Zuma had the Constitutional mandate to appoint and dismiss ministers and their deputies.&ldquo;However the Cabinet reshuffle occurs at a time when there has been much persistent and serious public concern and unease about the state of the nation with regard to many of its major elements, including political, governance, economic, and social.&rdquo;This concern was expressed by the public in the August 2016 elections, the foundation said, which resulted in significant losses of support for the ANC.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
