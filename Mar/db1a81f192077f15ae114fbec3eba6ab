"The response by the police was at best shambolic, at worst cowardly."Lead lawyer Samantha Leek told the inquest that the Tunisian investigating magistrate had found that "the units that should have intervened in the events deliberately and unjustifiably slowed down to delay their arrival at the hotel." But Tunisia's ambassador to Britain, Nabil Ammar, told the BBC that the accusation that the police had deliberately delayed their arrival was "exaggerated and unfair".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
