He was 49.Despite just more than five years having lapsed since his murder, no arrests had been made for his killing. Beeka&rsquo;s name is still being associated with decades-old probes and undercover operations.Lincoln had testified that as part of his infiltration of individuals allegedly involved in organised crime in the mid-1990s, he had spent time with some of them.This included Beeka and Yuri "the Russian" Ulianitski, who was gunned down in Milnerton in 2007.Drunk driving claimsLincoln was previously charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and leaving the scene of an accident on July 27, 1997.During his testimony, Lincoln had said that before the crash he was involved in, he had been out with people including Beeka. Some had claimed he was drunk at the time. Lincoln denied this.Directly after the crash, in which Lincoln said he was injured, he had called Beeka. He said he left the scene because he had needed medical treatment.Lincoln was acquitted of the drunk driving charge.In court proceedings in 2002, Peter Viljoen, a former member of the presidential unit who had also investigated Palazzolo, testified there had been warrants against Palazzolo and Beeka.ThreatsViljoen had testified that the warrants had to do with intimidation of Lincoln at his home.Beeka first phoned and wanted Lincoln to go and see Palazzolo, to make the case against him disappear, Viljoen had testified at the time.Lincoln did not go ahead with this."Beeka physically arrived at his house and threatened him to come see Palazzolo."This had happened in mid-1998.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
