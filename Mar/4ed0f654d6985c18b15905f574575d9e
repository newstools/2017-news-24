Gwala then ended the interview. "I am sorry, we have to move on because you clearly don't want to do this and you are determined to disrespect the medium, and there's absolutely nothing I can do about it," Gwala said at the end of the interview.Mbete said it was not unreasonable to expect Oliphant to respond in English.&nbsp;"We have on many previous occasions engaged with Ms Oliphant on air and other forms of correspondence in English, including communication which she has initiated," Mbete said.Mbete said Oliphant had been in conversation with producers since Sunday and was given ample time to request an interview in another language."If she had made this request ahead of time, we could have allocated additional time to the interview, to allow Xolani to translate," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
