Crayola announced on Friday, National Crayon Day, that it's replacing the colour dandelion in its 24-pack with a crayon in "the blue family". The company says it will leave it to fans to come up with a name for the replacement colour. It's only the third time in Crayola's long history that it has retired one or more colours and the first time it's swapped out a colour in its box of 24. Other colours that previously got the boot include maize, raw umber and orange yellow. Crayola crayons were first produced in 1903 by Binney & Smith.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
