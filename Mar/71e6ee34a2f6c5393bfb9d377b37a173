I saw the seriousness of it," Lincoln said."What was alarming in that report, the report detailed the activities of Palazzolo, who was alleged to be the sixth highest ranking of the Italian mafia and he was based in Cape Town&hellip;"It was alleged he had on his payroll the head of organised crime, the (former arts and culture) minister Pallo Jordan and (then organised crime head and assistant commissioner) Neels Venter."Lincoln took this information to Mandela, Mbeki and Mufamadi.Fivaz was not at the meeting where Lincoln had passed on the information about Jordan."Commissioner Venter was one of Fivaz&rsquo;s people&hellip; [that&rsquo;s why] it was too risky to file this report to Fivaz," Lincoln testified.Mandela had, therefore, set up the presidential investigative task unit.The case continues.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
