	     Mahikeng – The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) have welcomed the sentencing of a 54-year-old woman on 64 counts of fraud and theft. Speaking to News24 on Thursday, Hawks Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso said that the woman was arrested on August 30 last year. On Tuesday, Lynette Magdalena Joubert was sentenced to 15 years direct imprisonment at the Lichtenburg Regional Court in the small North West town after stealing approximately more than R600 000. Rikhotso said between April and October 2015 the accused was acting as an independent proxy for the registration of licence discs on behalf of individuals and companies. She would collect payments from her clients, and subsequently create fake proof of payments which she would then submit at the Ditsobotla traffic department as legitimate. “She was operating in Lichtenburg. No money was actually paid, she kept it for herself,” said Rikhotso. Rikhotso told News24 that the discs issued were legitimate because the proof of payment appeared to be legitimate.  Major General Linda Mbana, the Provincial Head of the Hawks applauded the investigation team for their work. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
