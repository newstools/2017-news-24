Local leader Abdelkrim El Khattabi inflicted a humiliating defeat on the occupiers and proclaimed the independent Republic of the Rif.Ties with Morocco's central authorities have long been tense.Just two years after Morocco won independence from France and Spain in 1956, the Rif revolted again - this time against the Arab-dominated government of the late King Hassan II.The revolt was crushed in another bloody crackdown that cost between 5 000 and 8 000 lives.Protests also rocked the Rif in 1984 and the region was also at the heart of Morocco's 2011 Arab Spring-inspired uprisings against corruption.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
