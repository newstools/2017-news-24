In addition, he said MPs had been threatened with losing their seats and with violence if they voted against him.Mbete previously said the UDM&rsquo;s application had no merit and it did not fall within the court's exclusive jurisdiction.She said if the court found she had the power to order a motion of no confidence via secret ballot, she would act in accordance with its ruling.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
