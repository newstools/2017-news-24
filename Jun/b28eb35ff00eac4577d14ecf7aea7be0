Moroccan authorities allege he trafficked several tonnes of cannabis into Europe.The Dutch news agency ANP said on Thursday that according to the Dutch justice ministry Morocco has given the Dutch guarantees that he will only be tried on allegations of drug-trafficking and not for any political activities.A Moroccan diplomatic source confirmed to AFP that he had been arrested in The Netherlands "with the view of extraditing him to Morocco.""This is an action against impunity. This individual has been able to play off against two justice systems, but from now on he must pay for his deeds," the source said, asking not to named.ANP said the man's case would now have to go before a court to see if judges agreed to extradite him.Chaou has reportedly lived in The Netherlands for most of the past 22 years.Earlier this week, prosecution officials confirmed they had arrested a man in 2015 in the southern Dutch town of Roosendaal as part of a crackdown on a drug network. But his current whereabouts were reportedly unknown.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
