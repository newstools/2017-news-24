During his opening address at the ANC's 5th policy conference, President Jacob Zuma bemoaned the tendency of opposition parties to drag matters to court, saying it is counter to democracy and undermines the issue of majority rule.

It all began with various groups entering the Nasrec Expo Centre's hall six, singing traditional songs from the party's liberation days - "Oliver Tambo bamb isandla sam&nbsp;[Oliver Tambo hold my hand]" and "ANC kuzo lawula wena, nalapha kuzo lawula wena&nbsp;[ANC you will rule, even here you will rule]".&nbsp;However, as more and more groups started to fill the hall, songs celebrating current particular leaders could be heard from the different regions. The North West group sang a song praising its premier, Supra Mahumapelo - "silamulele Supra&nbsp;[Help us Supra]" - while a louder, larger group on the other side of the hall began singing "Zuma, Zuma wethu". The Eastern Cape branch then began singing "Thuma mina Oliver Tambo, siyababona bayoyika&nbsp;[Send me Oliver Tambo, we can see that these ones are scared]". While singing this, the group made soccer gestures with their hands, signalling a change was needed, and began moving toward the large pro-Zuma group from KwaZulu-Natal, North West, Free State, Mpumalanga, Limpopo and the Women's League.&nbsp;Zuma warns ANC conference delegates against ill-discipline, factionalism&nbsp;President Jacob Zuma has warned against ill-discipline and factionalism in the ANC during his opening address at the party's policy conference in Johannesburg. Zuma took swipes at African National Congress leaders who he said had become primary conveyors of negative information about their own movement. "We need to look at the issue of ill-discipline in various forms, including public utterances, attacking the movement by ANC leaders and members, instead of handling matters within the organisation and finding solutions within the organisation. "This "irresponsible perpetual negative messaging by our own people has a negative impact on the economy", Zuma said.&nbsp;Zuma lashes out at critics within ANC&nbsp;President&nbsp;Jacob Zuma&nbsp;lashed out at critics within his African National Congress, saying they re threatening the ruling party s hold on power.&nbsp;"Factionalism is a cancer that must be rooted out," Zuma, 75, said on Friday in his opening address to a six-day ANC conference in Johannesburg that will discuss issues ranging from land reform and ownership of the country s mines to corruption. "We also need to look at the issue of ill-discipline in various forms, including public utterances attacking the movement by ANC leaders and members instead of handling matters within the organization and finding constructive solutions.&nbsp;"The conference takes place as the 105-year-old ANC grapples with internal divisions over a graft scandal that s implicated Zuma and some of his closest allies, and over who ll succeed him as party leader in December and probably as president in 2019. A group of ANC veterans, who ve urged Zuma to step down, boycotted the gathering after falling out with party bosses over what should be done to address the situation.&nbsp;A recession, a 28% unemployment rate and a decision by two ratings companies to downgrade the nation s sovereign credit rating to junk status after Zuma s March 31 firing of the respected Pravin Gordhan as his finance minister have added to the public discord. Deputy President&nbsp;Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe and party Treasurer-General&nbsp;Zweli Mkhize&nbsp;criticized Gordhan s dismissal.&nbsp;Out and about around the conference, an ANC member displays her support.&nbsp;#ANCPolicy Fashion Killa?! @News24 pic.twitter.com/Jmc04s0MoO#ANCPolicy but this is lackluster. pic.twitter.com/mR66BEmWI1#ANCPolicy President Jacob Zuma concludes his opening address with a song, as usual @News24 pic.twitter.com/hhmbAoOSNtZuma breaks out into song as he closes his address.&nbsp; #Zuma I thank you.
