Her family members went to Eskom's substation in Springs to find her after her disappearance. The white Hilux bakkie that she used was not there. However, the next day the bakkie was there, and a search for her ensued.The court also heard that on May 19, K9 dogs were used to find Yende, and a further attempt was made on May 29.The body was discovered in the storeroom at the Pietersboth substation, a site which Ngwenya allegedly frequented on occasion as a technician.Court also heard that the scene looked like it was "staged" to look like Yende committed suicide.Ngwenya is accused of injecting Yende with a substance, before striking her head with a crowbar and subsequently suffocating and strangling her after a struggle.The court heard that&nbsp;Ngwenya did not act alone, but rather with two other suspects who are still at large. An investigating officer testified on Tuesday that a witness -&nbsp;a sangoma&nbsp;- had come to the police station after the suspect and two others came to him and allegedly told him details about the commission of the crime, asking for a cleansing ceremony on two occasions.Also read:&nbsp;Man 'linked' to Eskom employee's death dies after questioning - policeAccording to the investigating officer, the witness came to the police before the suspect was in custody, and he was subsequently threatened by armed men at his house before fleeing to his mother's home in Soweto.He was again threatened by armed men in Soweto, and escaped by hiding in the ceiling.
