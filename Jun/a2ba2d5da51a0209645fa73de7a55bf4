Local and international NGOs "have a month starting from today" to declare the amount of foreign funding they receive in accordance with the law, a government statement said. It said the information must be passed on to the government. A government source, speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity, said authorities issued the statement in line with Tunisia's "war on corruption", without further elaborating. According to official estimates, some 18 000 NGOs operate in Tunisia, including around 3 000 set up after the 2011 uprising that toppled the regime of autocratic president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
