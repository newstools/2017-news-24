It also ensures that students who did not have access to the leaked paper are not prejudiced by an unfair advantage of competing with students who copied it."Van Eeden said new examination dates were set to avoid a long waiting period that would jeopardise progression of first-year students into second year, and second-year students from finishing the course and going into service.The investigations into the leak were continuing, she said.Denosa has reportedly taken legal action against the council for preventing students from writing exams until the investigation into how the paper was leaked is concluded.Student nurses at SANC offices in PTA, demanding fair treatment by the Council on cancelled exams.
