Bruce told TimesLIVE that he was not there, but at the Parkview police station to report the matter.This comes after Black First Land First issued a statement on Thursday, accusing the "white owned media" of unleashing "a massive campaign against the truth", and calling for a protest action at Bruce's house. "The media will not be allowed to be biased and all journalists who are propagandists for white monopoly capital must be named and shamed. We want the truth!"
