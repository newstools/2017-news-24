Radebe was the most trusted among the three, although the roundtable discussion included in the report, titled In Search of a Leader Befitting the Aspirations of South Africans, took place early in February &ndash; before it came to light that he had exchanged sexually suggestive SMSes with a female presidency staff member in 2014.The participants were &ldquo;mainly academics, professionals, people in business and civil society&rdquo;.Ramaphosa was hailed as &ldquo;a person wealthy enough not to be tempted to dip his hand in the cookie jar; understands business and will thus boost investor confidence; has an understanding of labour issues; and his involvement in the Convention for a Democratic SA negotiations put him in high standing&rdquo;. However, the participants also cautioned that he could &ldquo;promote the capitalist agenda and would not pay much attention to the plight of the poor, and [would concentrate] on high-level strategic matters, thus neglecting local economic focus&rdquo;, and that the &ldquo;Marikana massacre is still his albatross&rdquo;.Feedback from participants also showed that Ramaphosa was seen to have an &ldquo;interest in government business&rdquo; and that he was not actively championing the interests of young people. The report said South Africa was ready for a female president, which would work in Dlamini-Zuma&rsquo;s favour as she was also the first female chairperson of the AU Commission. The report stated that some of the participants felt that &ldquo;she cannot be judged for her alliance to her former husband&rdquo;.&ldquo;Her sterling performance at the department of home affairs and at foreign affairs is seen as a feather in her cap,&rdquo; it said.But she was also &ldquo;the first minister in democratic South Africa to [be involved in] a scandal&rdquo;, said the document in reference to the Sarafina 2 saga.There were also questions about her &ldquo;performance at the AU, [and] what type of a leader she would be&rdquo;.&ldquo;The feeling is that the presidency is not a dynasty to be passed from one family member to the next. "The main concern is that she would be Mr Zuma&rsquo;s proxy [and] the &lsquo;Guptarisation&rsquo; of South Africa will continue unabated,&rdquo; the report said, alluding to ongoing allegations that the politically connected Gupta family had used its proximity to Zuma to unfairly and irregularly gain government business.Radebe was touted as a possibility for the ANC presidency as he is the longest-serving minister and has a legal background, as well as an understanding of basic human rights. He has been at the forefront of government interventions and negotiations, and is regarded as &ldquo;the voice of reason in government matters and he has no known corruption scandals&rdquo;.Ramaphosa scored 44% of the support, Dlamini-Zuma came in with 28.5% and Radebe got 24.5%.ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize, his predecessor Mathews Phosa, National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete and Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu shared 2% of the votes, while 1% of the participants abstained.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
