	     Washington - The State Department is banning US diplomats in Egypt from visiting religious sites outside the capital following a spate of recent deadly terrorist attacks. The US Embassy in Cairo said on Monday that additional attacks are possible and urged Americans living or traveling in Egypt to take "prudent steps" to enhance their security. It said that the prohibition on US government officials' travel to religious sites outside of "greater Cairo" would remain in place until further notice. The ban comes after a series of attacks against the Christian community in Egypt, the latest of which last month killed 29 people. It was the fourth assault targeting Christians in Egypt since December. The attacks have been claimed by the Islamic State group. More than 100 people have been killed. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
