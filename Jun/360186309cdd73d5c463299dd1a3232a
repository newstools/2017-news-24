Demonstrators have rallied nightly in Al-Hoceima and the nearby town of Imzouren since Zefzafi's arrest.The Moroccan press has reported families joining together to start a group to campaign for the release of detainees.Protesters gathered at night after breaking their fast during the month of Ramadan when Muslims refrain from eating and drinking from dawn till sunset.Protesters gathered in Al-Hoceima late Saturday without incident, although their numbers were lower than in previous days.Around 500 people marched in Imzouren, around 15 kilometres (nine miles) from Al-Hoceima, an AFP photographer said."We are all Zefzafi," demonstrators shouted, demanding that detainees be freed.The previous night, protesters had clashed with security forces in Imzouren.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
