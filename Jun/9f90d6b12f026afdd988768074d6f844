Counselling, training, or attendance at programmes - Mr Gumede has been doing this work for 16 years without any insight into what he is doing incorrectly. Without that acknowledgment, how will these help?"'Nothing new'Howse said it was untrue that his client was in denial."He accepted every single thing that was said in the transcripts. He just gave reasons as to why he said those things."He said Van Rensburg was assuming that he had been conducting himself in a similar fashion in each and every matter - "thousands of them over 16 years" - and that he was not capable of rehabilitation."The presumption must be the other way: That in all other matters bar these nine, he has dealt with them properly," Howse said.He also argued that on a virtual daily basis magistrates committed irregularities by entering into the arena and acting inappropriately."This is nothing new&hellip; and some of the conduct which is being impugned in review and appeal proceedings is arguably more serious that what Mr Gumede has committed here."But I do not know of any other disciplinary process arising from those. This really is a first. Does one set the precedent of dismissal? It will determine how magistrates conduct themselves and they need to be free to exercise judicial discretions without looking over each shoulder."He described the relationship between Gumede and the Pinetown prosecutors as "toxic" - for which he could not be solely blamed - and that he had now been removed from that situation."The inference must be that he has a clean state," he said.In summary Gumede was convicted of:The hearing has been adjourned until July for further evidence on sanction and the ruling. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
