To meet our savings goals, we need every resident to limit their water use to no more than 100 litres per day," the statement said."Those who exceed this target do so at the expense of other residents... As such, the city has been doing its utmost to ensure that people are held accountable."Under level 4 restrictions, fines could be issued for:&bull; Irrigation or watering with municipal drinking water&bull; Topping up private swimming pools, even if they have a cover&bull; Washing vehicles and boats with municipal water (commercial car washes may apply for an exemption which will only be granted if wash water is recycled or waterless products are used)&bull; Running a water feature&bull; Hosing down of paved surfaces with municipal drinking water&bull; Using a portable play poolThe city said 25 000 water demand management devices had been installed since July 2016.This could limit water consumption in homes if necessary."The programme has been instrumental in extending available water supplies well into winter, and will continue to play a key role in increasing the city&rsquo;s water resilience."Xanthea Limberg, mayoral committee member for informal settlements, water and waste services; and energy, said ensuring each customer used less than 100 litres of water a day was impossible."I am therefore today calling on residents to take a more active role, either by reporting those who contravene the restrictions, or calling out their friends, colleagues and family members who are not behaving with 100 litres in mind," she said.Contraventions should be reported to water@capetown.gov.za.Evidence that may assist the city with the investigation should be attached. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
