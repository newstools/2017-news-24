The Borno state governor Kashim Shettima was financing the trench and had asked the Nigerian government for money to fund a permanent barrier, the report said. In January, two bombs exploded at the University of Maiduguri, killing five people.The first blast ripped through the mosque where professors were saying dawn prayers, while the second one went off at an entrance gate, witnesses said at the time.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
