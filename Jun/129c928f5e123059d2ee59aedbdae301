The party was no longer able to lead the alliance, Cronin said.The party had called for Zuma to step down and said he was not welcome at their July conference. They invited Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to represent the ANC instead."It would be hypocritical of us on the one hand to call for Zuma to step down as state president and then invite him to our conference. It would be uncomfortable for him as well," Cronin said.Tripartite alliance relations are at an all-time low due to the SACP and Cosatu rejecting Zuma. The alliance is expected to meet next week in an attempt to heal divisions.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
