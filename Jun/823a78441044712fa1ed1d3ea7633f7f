It was the second ambush this week on the same road, after an attack on Monday left one dead and four injured.The dangerous highway is nevertheless a lifeline for South Sudan, which imports almost everything, and for people fleeing the more than three-year-long civil war for the safety of refugee camps in Uganda.Since the government began deploying military escorts for convoys using the road in January there have been at least four separate deadly attacks, but this is the first time rebels have claimed responsibility.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
