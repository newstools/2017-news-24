"That is my vision for Lesotho," he said."We shouldn't have had an army in the first place... which country could we successfully attack?" he asked.The 2014 attempted coup was allegedly led by army chief Tlali Kamoli, who was removed from the post last year.Thabane said the election, which follows Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili losing a vote of no confidence, put the country at a "serious crossroads" after recent coalition governments have collapsed within a few years.Poverty, lack of jobs and access to health services were pressing issues that he said needed urgent attention from a stable government.The HIV-AIDS prevalence rate among adults is 22.7 percent, according to the UN, and many of Lesotho's people seek work in South Africa.The new government will replace a seven-party coalition led by Mosisili which was dissolved in March.It will be in power for only three years until the next general elections.If they can patch together a ruling coalition, Thabane and Monyane Moleleki of the AD party, have agreed to share the prime minister role, with the two taking 18 months each."In my heart that deal stands," Thabane said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
