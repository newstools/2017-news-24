But it's painful because it always happens to black people," said Zwane."I think SA must learn to respect each other if there is an issue, the issue must be addressed rather than beginning to label people on allegations."SPECIAL REPORT: #GuptaLeaksIn the so-called Gupta leaks, emails show that the controversial Gupta family were sent Zwane's CV a month before he was appointed minister of mineral resources, as well as that he took a trip to India on a Gupta plane where the Guptas picked up the bill for his accommodation.Zwane, who challenged the authenticity of the emails, said he has never seen any of the emails."I have not even seen one email. It would have been nice if these people who are alleging would actually post the emails to the papers so that we know what they are talking about. I've never even seen a single one of them, they are so fortunate to see what I don't know."Zwane said he was happy that Parliament was dealing with the issues of the emails.He added that people should stop making allegations and should stop judging people before a court of law has done so. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
