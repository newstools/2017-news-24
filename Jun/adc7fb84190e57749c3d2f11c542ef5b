"Political considerations have to be considered, yes, but they must not be above all else."The SARB announced on Tuesday that it is obtaining an urgent legal review of what it believes is unlawful action by Mkhwebane while the Democratic Alliance will also seek a meeting with Parliament's legal adviser to confirm the call was unlawful."Clearly, her recommendation goes beyond what she is legally empowered to do and is indicative of her long-term plan to render the Public Protector's office ineffective," DA legal commission chairperson Glynnis Breytenbach said.The effect of the "remedial action" appeared "sinister and a cause for great concern", and the party would be watching the developments, she added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
