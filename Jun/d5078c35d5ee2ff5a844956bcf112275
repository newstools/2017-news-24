Moroccan authorities allege he trafficked several tonnes of cannabis into Europe.He was reportedly arrested in 2015 in the southern Dutch town of Roosendaal as part of a crackdown on a drug network, the Dutch broadcaster NOS said Sunday. But his current whereabouts remain unclear, and the Dutch justice ministry said it "could not discuss individual cases".According to the Moroccan embassy website in The Hague, Abdelouahab Bellouki has been his country's envoy in The Netherlands since 2013. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
