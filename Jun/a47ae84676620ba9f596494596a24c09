There is no crisis," Lungu told journalists on Friday after the church leaders' statement.'We are a democratic country'Earlier in the week, government spokesperson Mulenga Kampamba told AFP: "Who tells you the country is sliding into a dictatorship? We are a democratic country where state institutions are operating without any interference."But such claims have failed to sway many outside observers, with Amnesty International's Southern Africa director Deprose Muchena warning in April that Hichilema and his aides were "victims of longstanding persecution" by the authorities, facing charges that are designed to "harass and intimidate".For Lungu's critics, his intentions of silencing Hichilema have been made brutally clear.Earlier this year, a senior official in Lungu's Patriotic Front party hinted that the government was losing its patience."He should take note that we will treat him the way a rat is treated if you want to catch it, for those of us who eat mbeba (rats) we know how to catch a rat," said deputy secretary general Mumbi Phiri."It is time that we confined him to the dustbins of political history."Days later Hichilema was arrested.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
