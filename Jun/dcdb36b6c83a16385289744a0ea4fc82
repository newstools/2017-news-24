His two boys put away their phones and get back to their books, pretending they have been studying.Tikane, from Mahikeng, a deputy director in the North West social development department, looks exhausted as he heads for the nearest couch, kicks off his formal shoes and takes a deep breath.Home time marks the start of Tikane&rsquo;s other job &ndash; that of a single parent. But he enjoys every moment, he says. Tikane understands the different characteristics of his children &ndash; son Lebogang, 19, daughter Tiiso, 15, and his youngest Tumiso, 14, &ndash; very well.He has been the only parent they have known since their mum died shortly after giving birth to Tumiso.&ldquo;Tiiso in most cases acts as the spokesperson for the collective. She gets to lead the delegation on most issues, but she is also considerate,&rdquo; he says proudly.&ldquo;Every time an issue is raised, it becomes clear that the pack has already caucused and agreed on it.&rdquo;Parenting has its challenges. Tikane attends parents&rsquo; meetings at three different schools, and they often clash &ndash; which is difficult for a single dad who wants to show commitment and interest in his children&rsquo;s schooling. He also wants to ensure the children get enough time for their studies, and he fervently monitors their progress.In terms of household management, Tikane says: &ldquo;We have someone who helps us with cleaning and laundry, but we do our own cooking on a rotational basis. "We often cook together and later enjoy dinner together.&rdquo;Tikane admits that raising a girl is a challenge, and that discussing certain issues is sometimes hard. While he buys her sanitary items, he says she still finds it difficult to tell him whenever she needs them. &ldquo;I would often hear it from her aunts. I have decided to give her space because she opens up easily to her aunts, but I hope one day we will be able to have those chats when she is ready,&rdquo; Tikane says.&ldquo;Being a single parent is no walk in the park ... The recipe is to respect the children, ensure they are happy ... I can&rsquo;t even think of bringing a woman home.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a happy family and I look forward to spending Father&rsquo;s Day with them. Maybe they have a surprise for me ... who knows.&rdquo;A politics enthusiast, Tikane thinks of himself as a responsible, disciplined and caring &ldquo;political principal&rdquo; determined to treat his children decently.&ldquo;I am a humble and caring father,&rdquo; he says. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
