The incident, which took place on Thursday evening, saw a female bomber entering Limani on the border with Nigeria and blowing herself up "behind the town's public school," a source close to the security services said."There were three people killed: two civilians and the bomber," the source said. Details of the attack were confirmed to AFP by a member of the local vigilance committee. In recent weeks, the restive Far North region has seen a resurgence in Boko Haram attacks after months of relative calm. Last week, a soldier was killed in an attack in Kolofata, 20km west of Limani, and in early June, nine civilians died in a double suicide bombing in the same town. In another incident on Thursday morning, one member of the vigilance committee in a village near Kolofata was killed and nine others wounded in a friendly fire incident, according to the source close to security officials. "The army made a mistake. They fired a rocket-propelled grenade towards a group of vigilantes" in the mistaken belief they were jihadists. Made up of local residents, these vigilance committees aim to inform security forces of any suspicious activity in a bid to prevent attacks by Boko Haram, which has been waging an insurgency since 2009.Though Boko Haram was born in Nigeria, the Islamic State-affiliated group has carried out frequent attacks in Cameroon, Chad and Niger, prompting the formation of a regional force to fight back.Some 200,000 Cameroonians from the Far North region have fled their villages in fear of the violence.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
