Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel, Andr&egrave; Traut, said the drugs were found in an uncollected bag in the airport&rsquo;s lost and found section.The bag belongs to a male passenger who landed in Cape Town earlier in the week on a flight from Lagos, Nigeria, via OR Tambo International Airport.&nbsp;He was being sought by police, but had not yet been arrested. "Failure of the passenger... to collect his bag raised the suspicion of authorities, and upon further investigation it was found that the contents was crystal meth, weighing 26kg," said Traut.&nbsp;The find is one of the biggest tik drug busts so far in 2017. In late February, SARS detector dogs sniffed out 100kg of tik, with an estimated street value of R30m, at an OR Tambo International Airport transit shed.&nbsp;The tik was hidden inside a consignment of 33 tins of vegetable oil from Cameroon. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
