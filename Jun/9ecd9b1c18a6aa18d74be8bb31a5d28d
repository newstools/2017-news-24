A threat of murdering (which is what &lsquo;disappearance&rsquo; clearly means) a journalist is also unprecedented in the history of this office, at least to my knowledge.&rdquo;Judge Ngoepe ruled that although Makasi complained that City Press had failed to obtain his comment, was inaccurate, unfair or deliberately dishonest in its reporting, and allowed commercial, political, personal or other non-professional considerations to influence or slant reporting, &ldquo;In almost all instances the article refers not just to one source, but to several sources some of whom, it should be added, are said to be senior people in the department.&rdquo;&ldquo;The impression one gets is that the information came from people within either the ministry or the department or both,&rdquo; he said. Ngoepe said it was &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; to infer that City Press allowed non-professional considerations to influence or slant reporting. &ldquo;Add to that the fact that there have in the past been similar reports about some of the department&rsquo;s projects, especially in Limpopo.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
