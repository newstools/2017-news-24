One witness, Abdibasit Hassan, said women were among those beheaded."The situation is grim over there. This attack was an unexpected one," Mohamed said. The extremists, including suicide bombers, reportedly attacked the base from three directions, forcing soldiers to retreat.Colonel Hashi Ahmed, a senior military official, told The Associated Press that reinforcement troops reached the area and drove the extremists out of the camp.He estimated that at least 100 fighters were involved in the attack.Al-Shabaab claimed killing at least 61 soldiers in the attack. The SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist groups, said the extremist group issued the claim via its Shahada News Agency. Al-Shabaab also said it seized a large amount of weapons and ammunition and more than a dozen military vehicles.Puntland in northern Somalia also faces a growing threat from ISIS-linked fighters who have split from al-Shabaab.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
