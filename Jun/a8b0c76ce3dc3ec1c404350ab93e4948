Kendrick General from Zimbabwe, who has been living in Margate for three years, said Africa Day was a chance for Africans to unite, remember their identity and learn from each other. When I came to South Africa I had to learn their ways and do as they do. I had to imitate how they address their elders, and their languages. General said South African law was not strict enough and there are too many unnecessary rights . Children need to be controlled at home, at school and in broader society. They are children, they don t know what they are doing. We are killing a nation by not controlling them from a young age, said General.He said paramount to this control was firearm control. If law enforcers carry the same weapons as criminals they will not to be able to apprehend them. And why do people need guns anyway, we are not at war, said General.Victor Amajouyi, a Nigerian businessman from Manaba, who has been living in South Africa for 15 years, said South Africa was the best place on the continent and its people only need to learn to value human life. For me being an African is a gift from God. It is something I am very proud of and the way South Africans treat other Africans show they have forgotten who they are and their Creator, he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
