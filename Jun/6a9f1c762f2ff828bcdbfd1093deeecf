It is true. Men must stop that [rape]."'The right hands'Limpopo police were said to have spoken to communities to drive this point home. One intervention involved convicted rapists encouraging men in engagement sessions to stop such criminal acts.The teenager was assigned a social worker and a trauma counsellor "to help her prepare for her case"."I want to assure members of communities that she is in the right hands. We are not ignoring the fact that she is underage," said Ngoepe.Justice ministry spokesperson Mthunzi Mhaga confirmed on Wednesday that the teen was being held at a child and youth care centre, awaiting finalisation of the preliminary inquiry.According to a general notice by the department on the Child Justice Act, such an inquiry aimed to ensure that a "collective, determined effort" was made to consider what should be done in the case of each child."The preliminary inquiry is designed to avoid children slipping through the intended safeguards, and to change negative practices from the past where insufficient attention was paid to children in the early stages of their case being processed, sometimes causing them to languish in detention for several weeks or even months."Legal Aid lawyerMhaga said a probation officer had conducted an assessment and compiled a report.The preliminary inquiry was previously postponed for the appointment of a Legal Aid lawyer for the girl.The inquiry process also involved a magistrate, the child's parents, a prosecutor, a probation officer, and the arresting police officer."These people will meet to talk to the child about his/her circumstances, his/her family environment and the factors that may have led the child to commit the crime," the police website explained.Consideration was given in the process for diverting the matter away from the criminal justice system.Mhaga said the case would be monitored by the chairperson of the Limpopo Provincial Child Justice Forum.Any developments would be reported on to the head of the National Technical Intersectoral Committee for Child Justice. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
