One netting of sardines doesn't mean a sardine run," he said.On whether the sardine fever will hit Durban on Thursday, Anderson-Reade said sardine lovers "will have to wait for tomorrow".He said they will be flying out to the south coast on Thursday to see whether there are any other fish around in the water."There may be nothing tomorrow [Thursday] and there may be nothing for the next two weeks," he said.Enormous shoalsAnderson-Reade said the weather had nothing to do with whether the sardines hit the shores of Durban or not on Wednesday."The weather at the moment doesn't play any huge role but it's more sea temperature related. It's related to the temperature of the water and various other things in the marine environment, not too much on the winds," he said.He said the last good sardine run was in 2012.According to the board's website, sardines are "cold-water fish and are usually associated with areas of cold ocean upwelling, where deeper, cooler, nutrient-rich water currents surge to the surface when they strike shallow coastal areas".Sardines are commonly found in enormous shoals on the west coasts of California, South America, Japan, Australia and, of course, southern Africa.On the Salt Fishing South Africa's Facebook group most people thought the sardine run had hit the province after the news of the sardines caught broke earlier.David Clarence wrote: "Sardine fever."Cameron Johnston wrote: "Apparently over 100 crates have been netted and they are selling at R800 per crate!!!"Vincent De Beer wrote: "I think the high tide is gonna bring some interesting [sic] times." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
