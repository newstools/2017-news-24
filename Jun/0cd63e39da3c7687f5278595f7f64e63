The vaccine is supposed to be kept in the dark at between 2C and 8C."This year alone we have received 70 children (who have died) of measles .... Vaccines are safe if (officials) follow the guidelines," said WHO country director Abdulmumin Usman.Nearly two million people have fled South Sudan, which is also suffering a famine induced by the conflict. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in fighting.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
