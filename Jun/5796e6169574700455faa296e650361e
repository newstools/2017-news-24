We will also request that social workers are dispatched to provide counselling to these learners, especially those who were forced to remain naked in full view of all the teachers and learners."Spokesperson for Limpopo MEC for education Dr Naledzani Rasila said they were aware of the incident after hearing it on the local radio station. They could, however, not confirm its veracity."The DA should have waited for the investigation to be completed and not just throw it out there before the information was verified," Rasila said.It has never been an education policy that any learner should be stripped of their clothing, Rasila said.He said they had requested their district department to investigate the matter.SACE could not be reached for comment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
