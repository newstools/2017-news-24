This should send a strong message to you, that you cannot fold your arms,&rdquo; he said. Holomisa ended his speech by telling UDM members that the coalition government in Nelson Mandela Bay is stable.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you are not aware, a three-member committee scrutinised the situation and found that the Executive Mayor and the Deputy Executive Mayor were both at fault in many respects,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We [the coalition partners] therefore took the stance that they either should shape up or ship out. Everyone must do their work, and follow the law and rules of the municipality.&rdquo;The Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan municipality is governed by a three-party coalition between the Democratic Alliance (DA), African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) and UDM.
