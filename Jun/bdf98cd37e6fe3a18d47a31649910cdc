The smaller UNAMID will be redeployed to the region of Jebel Marra, where most of the recent violence has been reported.The drawdown however could be reviewed if the Sudanese government fails to ensure protection in those areas from where the peacekeepers will withdraw.The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres will report to the council after six months on whether "conditions on the ground remain conducive to further reductions."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
