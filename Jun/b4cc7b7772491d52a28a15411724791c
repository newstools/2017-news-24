Its vicinity is being secured and we are dealing with potential runaway areas," Manuel explained.Smouldering fires are also being dealt with by the 60 firefighters, with the aim of making the towns liveable again, he said.A gentle westerly breeze was blowing in the Southern Cape, Manuel said. It was expected to continue until Thursday, when stronger south-westerly winds were forecast.&nbsp;Large parts of Knysna, Brenton-on-Sea, Buffalo Bay and surrounds, and parts of Plettenberg Bay, went up in flames two weeks ago.Nearly 10 000 people were evacuated and seven people died in at least 22 fires. Over 1 000 firefighters eventually brought them under control. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
