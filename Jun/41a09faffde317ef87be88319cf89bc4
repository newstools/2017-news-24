It is declared that it offends Section 7 of the Schools Act, 84 of 1996 for a public school &ndash;&nbsp; (i). To promote or allow its staff to promote that it as a public school adheres to only one, or predominantly only one, religion to the exclusion of others; and&nbsp; (ii). To hold out that it promotes the interests of any one religion in favour of others."The remainder of the relief claimed was refused and there was no order as to costs.Advocate Hendrik van Nieuwenhuizen, for OGOD, said it is in the interests of South African democracy that public schools are not allowed to promote a particular religion, but that the choice of religion lies with pupils. Advocate Adrian d'Oliveira, the school's legal representative, said every school community was unique and should therefore be allowed to choose a religious policy that serves the community. They wanted the court to recognise the "governing authority" of the school governing bodies.Advocate Matthew Chaskalson, for the minister of basic education, said the national policy on religion and education prohibited public schools from offering religious education in a single faith or in favour of a particular religious ethos.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
