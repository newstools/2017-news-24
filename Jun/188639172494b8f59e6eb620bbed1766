It must be clear. Put it in bold letters," said African National Congress MP Maesela Kekana.SPECIAL REPORT: #GuptaLeaksCourt reviewHoosen said the department must also include the motivations Gigaba had to consider when he granted them citizenship.Mashile said the committee will ask for all the relevant documentation. He expressed his concern about how much the committee could investigate, given that EFF indicated that they will ask the court to review Gigaba's decision.Hoosen was concerned that Mashile's reservations were an "attempt to deliberately stop this thing."I appeal to you to please not find ways for this thing not to happen," Hoosen said to Mashile."I have a responsibility to lead," retorted Mashile. "I'm not going to allow you to push me into a hole with my eyes open. I've got responsibilities as chairperson."He said Apleni should provide the hard facts, after which the committee would decide on a way forward.Parliament's legal services advocate Anthea Gordon said the sub judice rule does not prevent a matter before the courts from being discussed, but Parliament's own rule on sub judice could complicate matters.She said she would first like to see the EFF's notice of motion before delivering an opinion.Freedom Front Plus MP Corn&eacute; Mulder pointed out that a parliamentary rule could not supersede the Constitution.The committee will receive a further legal opinion and meet next week Tuesday, June 27, when they will hear from Apleni and receive the documents unless the legal opinion says otherwise.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
