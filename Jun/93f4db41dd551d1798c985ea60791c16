Blood on their Hands", published in June 2015. Similar allegations made in the past have typically been dismissed but President Muhammadu Buhari, who was just one month into office at the time, vowed to look into the claims.Separate claims from Human Rights Watch of extra-judicial killings, rape and sexual coercion at camps for those displaced by the conflict were also dismissed in the report.So, too, were Amnesty claims that Nigeria's security forces had killed at least 150 pro-Biafra protesters and injured hundreds more since August 2015 in the southeast.Angbazo said the board had raised concerns about several issues relating to the Boko Haram insurgency, including the processing of detainees and overcrowding at military jails."The current delay in the trials of Boko Haram detainees resulting in some cases in deaths in custody is unacceptable and a denial of the rights of fair trial," he added.Lack of access to legal representation or visits from legal practitioners was a "violation of human rights", he said, adding the board had recommended improvements.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
