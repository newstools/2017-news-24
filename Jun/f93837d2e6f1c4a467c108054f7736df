	     Cape Town - A brazen gunman opened fire in a Cape Town police station in the early hours of Wednesday morning, hitting a sergeant in the face. The officer has been admitted to hospital in a stable condition following the shootout in the Lingelethu West police station at 02:50. Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut confirmed that three suspects had entered the station, ostensibly to report a robbery. “One of the suspects produced a firearm and shot a police sergeant in his face. Police returned fire and the suspects fled,” he said. The trio are yet to be arrested. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
