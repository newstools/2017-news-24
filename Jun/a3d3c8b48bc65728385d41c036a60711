And the situation could become even more difficult in Banki once the rains begin, bringing with them an elevated risk of the spread of diseases."A new emergency, just as the rainy season is starting, has to be avoided at all costs," Grandi said.He said UNHCR was working hard to step up an information campaign in the Minawao camp "to ensure that refugees are given accurate information on the conditions in Banki before they make the choice to return." UNHCR said it was also working to help improve the situation in the town and ensure that returnees are quickly screened and receive food and shelter and other basic support.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
