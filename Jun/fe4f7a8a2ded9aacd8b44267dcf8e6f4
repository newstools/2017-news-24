She recommended that the Special Investigating Unit begin procedures aimed at recovering the money.Absa denies that it owes SARB&nbsp;R1.125bn, saying it met that obligation by October 1995.Mkhwebane also recommended that Parliament must amend a paragraph in the Constitution that removes reference to "protect the value of the currency". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
