Monday's prosecution request for a delay came after the defence questioned the court's legitimacy to judge war crimes, according to Kabangu. He said their imprisonment was "illegitimate."The trial opened 48 hours after President Joseph Kabila made his first official visit to Kasai, where violence erupted eight months ago. Some 400 people have been killed and 1.3 million displaced in Kasai, according to the UN, since government forces in September killed Kamwina Nsapu, a tribal chief and militia leader who had rebelled against Kabila.Last week, a group of international and local aid groups including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International called on the UN Human Rights Council to open an urgent inquiry into the violence.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
