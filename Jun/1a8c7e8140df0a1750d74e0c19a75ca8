Current president Ali Bongo is alive and well.Gabon Television director general Mathieu Koumba told AFP that Ovandong had been suspended as "a precautionary measure"."We need to protect her, too, because social media has had a field day," he added.Koumba appeared on the channel on Friday and said it had apologised to Bongo and his family for the "blunder"."It can happen to anyone. But this was a bit much because it was confusion over the head of state," he said. Ovandong had only been in the job for a few days after spending several years as a field reporter.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
