Samwu provincial chairperson Congo Matshepe said the union could not confirm that Wednesday night's fire was started by its members, but planned to meet later in the day to take stock of the shocking turn of events.Matshepe stressed that the workers were not on strike because there was a court interdict suspending their labour action, but had in fact gathered on the steps of the city hall to be briefed."The police shot at workers when they were standing outside the city hall," he claimed."Everybody was running from being shot. After being dispersed by police, they realised there was a fire."He said the first they knew of the fire was when they returned to their vehicles in the parking lot and saw the flames.Mangaung Metro spokesperson Qondile Khedama said the fire was a setback for the city. "If there is anything left, it will be a very small portion,'' he said of the sandstone building with its tall pillars.

"We do not want to speculate at this stage. We will wait for a report from the SA Police Service,'' said Khedama.He urged city hall employees to report for work.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
