In November 2015, the Western Cape High Court declared his appointment as COO irrational and illegal and set it aside. The courts denied him leave to appeal.In September 2016, the Supreme Court of Appeal also denied him leave to appeal.His most recent defeat came at the hands of the Labour Court last week, when he was denied an application to interdict the current disciplinary hearings and have Cassim removed.Majavu said Motsoeneng can only file responding affidavits on June 8, when he has sufficiently recovered and properly consulted with his legal team.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
