I know my mother still hopes that my sister is alive."Numerous allegationsThe past few years Flippie, one of Gert van Rooyen's sons, has been found guilty of perjury after making conflicting statements and allegations to the police about the whereabouts of the missing girls.These allegations led to fruitless searches at Umdloti on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast where Van Rooyen and Haarhoff had a holiday home.Flippie was sentenced to death in June 1991, just a year after his father's death, for murdering a Zimbabwean teenager. It was later changed to lifelong imprisonment.During his incarceration, he among others alleged that the bodies of the girls had been dipped in acid during satanic rituals; that they had been abducted to the Middle East and at one stage he also said that "certain highly-placed members of the National Party government," had been involved in the abduction and "selling" of the girls.Following his allegations, Van Rooyen's home in Capital Park, Pretoria, was demolished brick by brick and huge areas of the beach at the KwaZulu-Natal coast were searched for clues to ascertain the whereabouts of the young girls.Flippie's sentence for perjury ran concurrently with his sentence of lifelong imprisonment. He has in the meantime been released on parole.His legal representative, Advocate Lawrence Barit, said that Flippie could not comment on the latest search because his parole only expired in 2019 and several conditions had been attached to his parole.However, a former acquaintance of Flippie said: "There's always been rumours about something happening at the north coast. At the time Flippie said something to that effect."The police said in 2007, after new rumours that the bodies of the girls had been hidden just about 2km from the Pretoria home, that they had never formally closed Gert van Rooyen's dossier."If there was new information, we act on it," the police said at the time.That search also didn't yield any results.* The police started watching Gert van Rooyen in 1990 after the kidnapped Joan Booysens managed to escape and informed the police about him and Haarhoff's activities.* Fokus will broadcast a special report on the Durban excavations on SABC2 on Sunday at 19:00 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
