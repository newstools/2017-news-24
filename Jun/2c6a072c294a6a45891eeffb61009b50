The two were allegedly sitting in the victim's car when the man was ambushed by three armed men.&nbsp;One of the suspects allegedly threatened him with a knife before they all got into the car, and forced the young man to drive to a flat in Sunnyside. The suspects then allegedly demanded money and bank cards from him, which he did not have. The victim&rsquo;s brother was then called to pay a ransom amount to the suspects in order to guarantee his safety and freedom. &nbsp;&nbsp; According to the statement, upon his arrival in Sunnyside, the brother alerted a police van that was on patrol in the area of the kidnapping, and the accused was caught trying to run away. The other suspects are still at large. &nbsp;&nbsp; There is no trace of the woman, which Mavimbela says is something common in most cases &ldquo;where similar meetings result in kidnappings, robberies, theft of motor vehicles and hijackings&rdquo;. &nbsp;&nbsp; Mavimbela said that two months ago, another man had R190 000 taken from his bank account by kidnappers after one of the kidnappers accused the 54-year-old Johannesburg man of sleeping with his wife.The two had also allegedly met through a dating site, and organised a blind sex date at the woman&rsquo;s flat, said Mavimbela. &nbsp;&nbsp; "People should be extra vigilant when engaging with strangers through social media and online dating sites,&rdquo; said Mavimbela in a statement. &nbsp;&nbsp; Mavimbela told News24 that the suspect is out on R1 000 bail, and his case will be heard on July 6.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
