The committee on Thursday expressed its concern about the attacks on three police stations during the last five days in different parts of the country.&nbsp; It also called for urgent steps to be taken by acting national commissioner Lieutenant General Lesetja Mothiba and the provincial police commissioners to address what it describes as a worrying trend. The committee said the killing of two policemen at the police station in Koffiefontein in the Free State and the gun attack on an officer at a Cape Town police station could not be tolerated and had to be condemned in the strongest possible terms. "Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of the policemen killed and the injured policeman," said the committee chairperson Francois Beukman.&nbsp; The attacks showed that criminals had no respect for the institutions that were established to uphold the law.Also read:&nbsp;Mbalula condemns brazen attack on Cape Town police stationThe committee was of the view that its 2017 budget recommendations should be implemented urgently. These include the installation of CCTV cameras at the community centres of SAPS stations countrywide and the allocation of body cameras and security technology to all frontline visible policing staff at stations.&nbsp; Beukman said it was also critical that the SAPS Management Intervention Unit reviews the current security protocols at police stations, in order to improve security.&nbsp; The committee will ask police management to brief it on the implementation of security measures at police stations at the end of July, during the committee&rsquo;s oversight visit to KwaZulu-Natal. &nbsp;&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
