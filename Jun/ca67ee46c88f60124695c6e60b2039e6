They must be able to provide a safe, nurturing environment.There are currently 646 active Safety Parents in the Western Cape.People interested in becoming volunteers can apply at the department of social development."We can stop the violence and murder of children and youth if we all play a part in creating the sort of stable, loving and caring family spaces which are so sorely needed in communities," said Fritz.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
