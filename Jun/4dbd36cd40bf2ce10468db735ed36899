"Arrest us, we are all activists," read one banner. The mainly ethnically Berber Rif region has long had a tense relationship with Morocco's central authorities, and was at the heart of Arab Spring-inspired protests in 2011.Anti-riot police were at the protest, following clashes between demonstrators and security forces over the weekend, but the crowd dispersed at around midnight without incident.Zefzafi was detained along with others on Monday morning for "attacking internal security", after a warrant for his arrest issued Friday sparked turmoil in Al-Hoceima, a city of 56,000 inhabitants.State media outlets and politicians have remained largely silent on the events, but the local branches of three parties including the ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD) issued a joint statement warning of a "serious situation" and criticising the state's response.Out of around 40 people authorities say they arrested Friday, including core members of Al-Hirak, 25 have been referred to the prosecution.Their trial began Tuesday but has been pushed back to June 6 at the request of their lawyers, who have complained their clients were ill-treated during their detention.Seven suspects were released on bail while another seven were released without charge.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
