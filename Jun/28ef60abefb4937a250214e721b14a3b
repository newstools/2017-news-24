This comes as vandalism caused delays on Metrorail's Cape Town commuter lines on Monday morning."Untu has no choice but to demand from the legislature to impose life imprisonment for these crimes - similar to that imposed for offences of premeditated murder, gang rape, serial rape and treason," said Steve Harris, Untu general secretary.
