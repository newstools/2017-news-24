It will take at least three consecutive winters of above-average rainfall to make a real difference."Residents were also urged to, where possible, use suitable containers to capture rainwater."[These are] perfect for flushing toilets&hellip; flushing an average toilet could save 9 litres per flush depending on the type of toilet."LIVE: #CapeStorm - 5 confirmed fatalitiesDrinking waterThe city's mayoral committee member for informal settlements, water and waste services; and energy, Xanthea Limberg, said that due to climatic unpredictability, no one could "definitely predict when our next big rainfall will occur."We must therefore continue to save water now and we cannot afford to have our water use influenced by the weather - using less than 100 litres per person per day whether at home, work, school or elsewhere remains the requirement."According to the statement, the city had made provisions to capture some of the excessive inflows at wastewater treatment works."There are critical points in the sewer reticulation system where storm water is diverted to the sewer system. This water is treated to make more treated effluent available. Investigations [are] under way to see how [we can] capture urban storm water at a greater scale and then store it for later treatment and use."The city added that drinking water was safe to drink."Rigorous and regular tests are conducted to maintain the high level of water quality." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
