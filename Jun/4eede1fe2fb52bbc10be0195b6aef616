The department is in preparation for the tabling of outstanding names."But Hoosen was not appeased."Cleary, Minister Gigaba was acting to hide the truth that he had personally granted the Guptas citizenship," he said.He pointed out that, according to section 5(9)(b) of the South African Citizenship Act 88 of 1995 5(9)(b), the minister must, "within 14 days after the commencement of the sittings of Parliament in each year", table in Parliament the names of persons granted citizenship because of "exceptional circumstances", and must include the reasons for the early granting of citizenship."Gigaba failed to table the names of the Guptas, as confirmed by the director general, and which the DA can confirm after scrutinising the tablings from that period."There is mounting evidence that Minister Malusi Gigaba, his ANC Cabinet colleagues and President Jacob Zuma have bent the rules to benefit the Guptas across the board," said Hoosen.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
