She said the "authorities should not allow vaguely worded charges to be used to impose harsh sentences on spurious grounds. Everyone should have the right to follow their own beliefs in matters of religion and morality."On Sunday, dozens of Tunisians demonstrated in Tunis to demand the right to eat and drink in public during Ramadan.During the holy month, observant Muslims worldwide abstain from eating, drinking, smoking and having sex from dawn to dusk.Tunisia's constitution guarantees "freedom of belief and conscience", but the state is also the "guardian of religion".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
