Opposition parties are trying to forge an electoral alliance in a bid to oust the 93-year-old Mugabe whom the ruling party is fielding.But Mugabe has scoffed at the planned alliance as combination of zeros saying it would make victory easier for his ruling party as it focusses on one common rival rather than separate opponents.ZANU-PF is widely seen as divided over Mugabe's successor, with Mnangagwa seen as one of the favoured replacements along with Mugabe's wife Grace. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
