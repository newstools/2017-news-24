We request that he be suspended," branch chairperson Sthembiso Tembe told a meeting of members."As we speak, we don't even know the conditions of that special leave. I was told this morning that he will still have access to his emails and everything," said Tembe.Wage negotiationThe union had on Tuesday called for Mgidlana's immediate suspension, and threatened to bar him from entering his office if he was not suspended by the end of the week.The came in the middle of a wage negotiation between Parliament and the union, after it was announced Parliament workers would receive a 0% salary increase this financial year.Tembe accused Mgidlana of negotiating in bad faith.Mgidlana released a statement on June 4 denying the allegations against him, saying no shred of evidence had been produced to back them up."Central to the union's malicious allegations is a claim that the current financial difficulty is caused by financial mismanagement and/or corruption. This is a deliberately misleading, baseless and unnecessary propagation of untruths," he said.The financial management of Parliament was regularly checked by the multiparty joint standing committee on financial management of Parliament and annually by the Auditor-General, who granted the institution a clean audit in its last report. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
