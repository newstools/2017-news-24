More mountaineering rescuers had in the meantime been called out and sent into the mountain," he said."The assessment was that it was not a life threatening injury and hence the SAAF's Oryx could not be approved. Our team spent the night with the injured [girl] in the mountain."Some of her friends also elected to stay with her overnight, Marais said."A medic and more than four technical rescuers also remained with the patient. At around 03:00 some of the uninjured persons were brought down."Anchors were prepared and a plan was put in place to lower her from her position after sunrise, and by 08:25 on Monday morning, a Skymed helicopter was on scene after being approved for the extraction."The helicopter extracted the patient and the medic in one go. Thereafter, they lightened the aircraft and will return to the scene to extract the other rescuers two at a time. This is ongoing," he said.She was flown to a temporary landing zone at Forest Station in Orange Kloof and was thereafter transported to hospital for treatment, Marais confirmed. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
