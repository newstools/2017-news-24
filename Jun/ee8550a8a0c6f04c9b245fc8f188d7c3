She recommended that the Special Investigating Unit begin procedures aimed at recovering the money. Absa denies that it owed SARB R1.125bn, saying it met that obligation by October 1995.Mkhwebane also recommended that Parliament amend a paragraph in the Constitution that removes reference to "protect the value of the currency".

A minimum of 50% black representation at board level would be required, of which 25% need to be women.At senior management level, a minimum of 60% black ownership was required, while 88% of black ownership was required at junior management level.The charter also required 70% procurement of mining goods from black economic empowerment companies.'We engaged financial institutions'Zwane said the department had listened to workers and communities who had not seen real economic benefits from mining activities."We engaged financial institutions who need to make profit, but also address developmental needs. We also listened to the sector who asked for policy certainty, but also wanted clarity on historic deals."The black ownership matter had been a bone of contention for a number of years and the Chamber of Mines had in the past spoken about approaching the courts for a declaratory order in respect of the once empowered-always-empowered principle.In the previous draft charter, mining companies were supposed to have a perpetual 26% black ownership, even if the original empowerment company disposed of its shares.The Chamber had held the belief that once it had met the empowerment criteria they should be exempted from further empowerment obligations.The new Mining Charter has caused considerable unhappiness in the mining industry, which claimed it has not been properly consulted before its publication.The Chamber of Mines, which represents 90% of South Africa&rsquo;s mines, issued a statement slamming the process followed by the DMR in drafting the latest version of the Charter.During a question and answer session in the National Assembly on Thursday, President Jacob Zuma endorsed the new Charter, saying the revised regulations were drawn up in consultation with Cabinet.The ANC also suggested that Zwane did not consult with the ruling party&rsquo;s economic transformation committee before releasing the charter, and said it is concerned about its impact on employment.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
