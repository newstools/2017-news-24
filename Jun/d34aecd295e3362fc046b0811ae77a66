He told judges he joined a rebel group called the Rwandan Patriotic Army at the age of 17 and underwent a four-month basic training before being selected for advanced leadership training and rising to the rank of regimental sergeant major while still in his teens.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
