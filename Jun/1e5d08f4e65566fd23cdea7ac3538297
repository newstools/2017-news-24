Watch.WATCHCape Town - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa's commitment to addressing gender-based violence was questioned in the National Assembly on Wednesday.Responding to Inkatha Freedom Party MP Liezl van der Merwe's initial question on the national integrated plan against gender-based violence, Ramaphosa outlined the government's response to this scourge.Van der Merwe, in her follow-up question, said, "As things stand at the moment, there is no political will to address gender-based violence".She said government is clearly not serious about addressing gender-based violence if they do not adequately fund programmes against it."This is not good enough," she said.She asked what he would do as the leader of government to hold ministers who are supposed to deal with gender-based violence, in particular minister of social development Bathabile Dlamini, to account.Ramaphosa did not answer this question directly."You'll be pleased to know CABINET is at work addressing this matter," he said."Clearly, coming up with political leadership is necessary. I will not fault you on that and I agree completely."He also agreed that there should be better funding."We need to double, or redouble our resolve. The governing party has taken this up as a major campaign."He said this campaign should know no political allegiances.&lsquo;Speak out&rsquo;"Where interventions are weak, we need to speak out."Economic Freedom Fighters MP Veronica Mente referred to a meeting on gender-based violence, which Ramaphosa left early.Active citizenry"You are not committed as you are telling us," she said.She said this flows through to the respective ministers."If you half commit yourself, they (ministers) will do the same," she said.Ramaphosa said his reason for leaving the meeting she referred to was well explained."We should all get engaged in this process (against gender-based violence). I want to see myself in the streets, walking side by side with you."National Freedom Party MP Prof Moses Khubisa raised the matter of human trafficking.Ramaphosa said it should be publicised and talked about, as an active citizenry is required to stop it."Every street through the country should be actively involved in preventing violence against women and children."He said human trafficking cannot be tolerated and people need to bring information to the law enforcement agencies."The best way is to never stop talking about this matter, to never stop taking action against this scourge. All of us, as leaders, we must not let up."&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
