The policeman, 35, allegedly shot his neighbour in the stomach following an argument between the neighbour and his father on Wednesday afternoon. "It is alleged that the complainant had an argument with his neighbour and the neighbour’s son withdrew his firearm and shot the complainant in the stomach," said Captain Nqobile Gwala. Reaction Unit South Africa spokesperson Prem Balram said the incident took place on Flamingo Way in Dawncrest at about 16:00. The argument between the neighbours was sparked by a plastic packet that was lying on the road, said Balram. "During the argument, the off duty policeman drew his firearm and fired approximately 12 rounds at his neighbour," he said. "Several of the rounds struck the victim's Kia bakkie while one bullet entered the victim's abdomen and exited through his back. The policeman then fled the scene," Balram said. Gwala said the suspect was later arrested for attempted murder. He will appear in court soon, added Gwala.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
