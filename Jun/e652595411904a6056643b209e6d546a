In August 2016, the party successfully overturned a decision by a civil judge to ban it, and has denounced what it says is "police harassment" in Tunisia. The Tunisian branch of the pan-Islamic movement appeared in the 1980s but it remained on a list of banned organisations until after the 2011 overthrow of longtime strongman Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.The party is frequently accused of causing public disturbances with its rallies and had its annual congress cancelled in June for "security reasons". "This is a party that does not recognise the civilian character of the state," said Interior Minister Hedi Majdoub.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
