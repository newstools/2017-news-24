Watch as the SABC address media on their decision here.WATCHCape Town - Hlaudi Motsoeneng's dismissal from the SABC presents an opportunity to rebuild the public broadcaster in a fast changing world, the Media Workers Association of SA (Mwasa) said on Monday.&ldquo;There is a silver lining to the SABC cloud after all but lots of goodwill and hard work would be required going forward,&rdquo; said Mwasa general secretary Tuwani Gumani.The SABC announced Motsoeneng's dismissal earlier after he was found guilty following an internal disciplinary hearing where charges of bringing the SABC into disrepute and causing irreparable damage to his employer were investigated.This followed a press briefing he held on April 19 where he laid into the interim board and the parliamentary ad-hoc committee on the problems at the SABC.Since taking the helm, the interim board has reversed his decree that 90% of all music on SABC radio stations must be by local artists and that no violent protests be screened during news broadcasts.Interim board chair Khanyisile Kweyama said at a press conference on Monday that Motsoeneng had no respect for his contract.Meanwhile, Mwasa said the removal of Motsoeneng should herald the beginning of the reconfiguring of the operations and relevance of the public broadcaster.&ldquo;As matters stand, with six ministers since 2010, and a recently split communications mandate, the country lags leagues behind its peers in terms of digital migration while small-time ruling-party politics remain the order of the day,&rdquo; said Gumani.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
