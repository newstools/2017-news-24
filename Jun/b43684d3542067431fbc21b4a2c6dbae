It criminalised a gathering of more than 15 people purely because no notice was given.Advocate Michael Bishop, for the SJC, said it could not be assumed that every unnotified gathering would be violent and that every notified gathering would be peaceful.He proposed alternative measures, such as imposing administrative fines rather than criminal penalties.Part of the SJC's argument was that the criminal penalties were severe and had a chilling effect by deterring people from free assembly and free speech.Ndita asked the police minister's legal team to persuade her that it would not have a chilling effect."A criminal conviction limits one's life. There are certain things you cannot do," the judge noted.Pillay said people could still gather. They simply had to give notice and could also challenge obstructive authorities."I can't deny that a criminal section is a harsh outcome. It is precisely because of its harshness that it has the deterrent effect that the minister says it does."She wondered whether an administrative fine would have the same effect.The court reserved judgment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
