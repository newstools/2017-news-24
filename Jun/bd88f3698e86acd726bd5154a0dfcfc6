His response, both orally and in writing, was that the move would be premature," he claimed.Viranna said Monday&rsquo;s "about-turn" on this issue by Dlungwana was therefore surprising, yet welcomed."The DA sincerely hopes that it is not merely an empty threat. We can only assume that the MEC has finally realised the severe effect that poor leadership has on our schools, and the long-term impact that this has on teaching and learning," he said.However, when News24 contacted Kwazi Mthethwa, spokesperson for Dlungwana, he dismissed the claims.Mthethwa said the DA was trying to "confuse" the public."The MEC only said district directors, circuit managers and school principals would be made to account. He has been misquoted," said Mthethwa.Dlungwana was on record as saying that if any school received a 0% pass rate, "the officials would be made to account because, as the department, we have made sure that they get much needed support throughout the year"."Dlungwana is not trigger happy. He just believes that there should be, what we refer to as, 'consequence management', meaning that employees should and must be held accountable for their actions," said Mthethwa.Asked how officials from the worst performing schools would be held accountable, Mthethwa said "it would depend on the circumstances. There won&rsquo;t be a one size fits all type of approach". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
