Unfortunately, she declined," Maimane said.Zille has been suspended from all party related activities until her disciplinary hearing is concluded. A notice of suspension will be served on her in this regard.Sanco&rsquo;s national spokesperson, Jabu Mahlangu, said they are unimpressed with Zille&rsquo;s suspension as the DA disciplinary processes are cover-ups.&ldquo;As they have done with the Diane Kohler-Barnard, Chris Roberts and Ramsay cases, the federal executive council is simply going to deliver a verdict that will massage her racist ego and reassure the right-wing inner circle that the party is still their comfort zone,&rdquo; said Mahlangu.Mahlangu said Maimane who is the face of the party is merely a beneficiary of Zille&rsquo;s &ldquo;rent-a-black strategy to bring blacks into the leadership of the DA to project the image of a transformed party.&ldquo;He will not garner enough support to dismiss Zille because racism is ingrained in the DA&rsquo;s DNA including its embrace of colonialism and the legacy of apartheid&rdquo;.In a statement released on Twitter, Zille fired back at the DA saying she has not accepted that the party has the right to find her guilty or penalise her before the hearing takes place. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
