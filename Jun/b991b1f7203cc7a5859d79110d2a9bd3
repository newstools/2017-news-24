The water can be used for flushing toilets.&nbsp; &nbsp; "The city urges residents, where possible, to use suitable containers to capture rainwater, which is perfect for flushing toilets as an example. Flushing the toilet with rainwater could save nine litres or more per flush, depending on the type of toilet.""As a result of climatic unpredictability, no one is able to definitely predict when our next big rainfall will occur. We must therefore continue to save water.&nbsp;"I appeal to all residents to take care and be extra cautious on the roads. Please take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of your loved ones, pets, property and possessions," said the statement released on behalf of the city's mayor, Patricia de Lille.&nbsp;See weather patterns below:&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
