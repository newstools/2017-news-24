It was not my intention, my intention had been to rob her of her cellphone. I don&rsquo;t know what evil spirit took hold of me.&rdquo;That&rsquo;s what Howard Oliver, 28, wrote in a letter of apology to the family and friends of Franziska Bl&ouml;chliger, who he raped and murdered in Tokai Forest in 2016. The letter was read in the High Court in Cape Town on Thursday by Oliver&rsquo;s legal representative, Advocate Henk Carstens, in mitigation of sentence, Netwerk24 reported. &nbsp;&ldquo;I want to ask the victim&rsquo;s family and next of kin, as well as the greater Westlake community to forgive me for what I did. I know it won&rsquo;t bring back their daughter.&rdquo; Carstens said Oliver had written the letter two months after the murder, showing that he&rsquo;d shown remorse from the start.Oliver was found guilty of rape, murder and theft on Wednesday. He&rsquo;d initially denied guilt, but on Tuesday confessed via Carstens.Judge Kate Savage wanted to know what had led to &ldquo;things getting out of hand&rdquo; and him raping and killing Franziska. &nbsp; Carstens said Oliver had had financial problems and had asked his employer for a loan. His family also pressurised him to pay his daughter&rsquo;s cr&egrave;che fees. &ldquo;Is there any explanation as to what drove him to go into the forest and rape and kill a young woman?" Judge Savage wanted to know. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Carstens. He said his client himself had been shocked by his behaviour when he grabbed her. &nbsp; Oliver&rsquo;s wife, Shannon-Lee, 23, said after the sentencing proceedings that she wasn&rsquo;t ready to talk about Horward yet. She was supported at court by her mom and other family members. &nbsp;Franziska&rsquo;s family was not in court. Oliver will appear in court for sentencing on June 7.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
