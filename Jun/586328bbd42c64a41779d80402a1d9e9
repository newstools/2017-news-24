He denied that they were on a strike, saying they were on a "go slow" instead.He said the union members will not assist in conducting autopsies until a pay raise is given and learnerships offered for union members to become registered pathologists.It is illegal to complete an autopsy without the necessary qualification.It is unclear whether the unfolding crisis affects Muslim burials which require their dead to be buried within 24 hours.The provincial health department did not respond to specific questions asking whether Muslim burials are affected.The Muslim Judicial Council and Jamiatul Ulama SA (Council of Muslim Theologians) could also not be reached for comment.In a statement on Wednesday, the provincial health department said the military had been deployed to assist forensic services until the crisis has been solved.The department said negations will continue on Thursday morning to restore forensic services to normal capacity as soon as possible.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
