Several payments were also made without any work being carried out. Several basic mathematical rules were overlooked in those transactions."Mngxitama said he also laid the charge "in accordance with the corruption act against especially Gordhan and Nene because they had known about the corruption (which allegedly) occurred in Treasury, but they did nothing about it."It's our opinion that corruption in the Treasury systematically took place while these individuals were in charge. That's why we laid the charges." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
