Clashes related to the weekend violence were also reported in Saurimo, in the northeast of the Lunda-Norte province, 400km east of Cuango.The LCP said it had written to President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and local authorities notifying them of the march beforehand and vowed to hold further protests."The regime must stop shooting at people who march peacefully and are only exercising their rights," said Jose Zecamutchima, president of the LCP movement.Angolan authorities arrested five Lunda Chokwe activists in March 2016 on suspicion of attempting to murder a police officer. They remain in prison.Police have been quick to clamp down on political gatherings in recent months ahead of legislative elections expected in August which will likely see a new president from the ruling party replace Dos Santos who will not contest the poll.Dos Santos's government has been criticised as secretive and corrupt, with authorities accused of crushing dissent. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
