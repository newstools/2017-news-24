	     Libreville - Chadian president Idriss Deby Itno threatened on Sunday to pull his country's troops out of African peacekeeping operations because of a lack of financial support to the cash-strapped country. "We have not at all been supported on the financial, economic side," he said in an interview to several French media. "If nothing is done, if that goes on, Chad will be obliged to withdraw," from operations abroad, he added. Chad is currently the third-largest contributor to MINUSMA, the UN peacekeeping force in Mali, with 1 390 soldiers. It has contributed 2 000 troops to the force fighting Boko Haram, the Islamist group based in Nigeria but also active across the borders in northeast Nigeria.  The other countries involved in the regional force are Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria. "We can't keep being everywhere, in Niger, in Cameroon and in Mali," he said. "All that is excessively expensive." Chad has been in economic crisis for several years now, exacerbated by low oil prices, its main source of revenue. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
