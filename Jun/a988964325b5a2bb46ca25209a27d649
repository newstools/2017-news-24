The second surgery "also went well," it said.Talon "has completely recovered" and "is fully exercising his constitutional duties," according to his office, which said an ordinary cabinet meeting is scheduled for Wednesday. The statement on Monday was a rare example of an African leader publicly revealing health details, but his office said it was important for him to inform his fellow countrymen about the state of his health.The health of presidents in Africa remains a taboo subject on the continent. Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari has spent much of his time in London since the beginning of the year for health reasons that have not been publicly disclosed.Because of his health, Talon missed the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) summit held in Liberia on June 4 and a cabinet meeting of his senior ministers on May 31. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
