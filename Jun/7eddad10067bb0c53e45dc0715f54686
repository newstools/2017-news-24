President Jacob Zuma is facing tough questions as he makes his address to Parliament. Jump to bottom For the umpteenth time today Jacob Zuma says &quot;don&#39;t worry&quot;. #ZumaQandA @News24DA makes sucking noises while ANC MP Hope Malgas asks her follow-up question #ZumaQandA @News24&quot;The people of SA did not make a mistake electing me president. I&#39;m fit, and I&#39;m doing it very well,&quot; says Jacob Zuma #ZumaQandA @News24#PresZuma: I can tell you, next elections you will never win these metros #ZumaQandAZuma chuckles after Maimane asked him if he believes he is the right person to lead South Africa. #ZumaQandA @News24Zuma says there&#39;s no need for a secret ballot. Parliament has dealt with a #NoConfidence vote 7 times, and failed. #ZumaQandA @News24Zuma says #SecretBallot is not fair because the opposition is trying to get a majority they don&#39;t have #ZumaQandA @News24Zuma says he faced several motions of no confidence. DA&#39;s @DKB20 says: &quot;Are you getting the hint yet?&quot; #ZumaQandA @News24FF Plus&#39;s Mulder asks Zuma if he will support the idea of a #secretballot. #ZumaQandA @News24&quot;Don&#39;t worry about anything, just sit in peace. Don&#39;t worry,&quot; says President Jacob Zuma #ZumaQandA @News24ANC&#39;s Jackson Mthembu has a book titled &quot;Eerie assignment&quot; on his desk. My guess is its about his time as chief whip. #ZumaQandA @News24 pic.twitter.com/c2fHpbberdZuma says he doesn&#39;t know where Carter is getting her stats from. &quot;Just do more research. You will get to the truth.&quot; #ZumaQandA @News24Zuma to Cope&#39;s Deidre Carter: &quot;Don&#39;t show me your cellular. Because your cellular can be given numbers.&quot; #ZumaQandA @News24Cope MP DCarter follows up and attempts to correct Zuma. The only countries in recession are SA and Finland, she claims. #ZumaQandA @News24Zuma: You are being funny to a young man who has gone to school and capacitated himself. #ZumaQandA @News24Zuma speaking about Duduzane: &quot;You can&#39;t single out one person and vicitmise him because he is the son of the president.&quot; #ZumaQandA @News24Zuma: I&#39;ve never assisted him (Duduzane) on any business. #ZumaQandA @News24DA&#39;s @MmusiMaimane to Jacob Zuma: &quot;I&#39;m here to speak on behalf of the Duduzane&#39;s who is not politically connected.&quot; #ZumaQandA @News24Zuma repeats an old mantra. &quot;Rising unemployment is a global problem. It&#39;s not just a SA problem.&quot; #ZumaQandA @News24Maimane: Are you willing to concede that your presidency has only benefitted a few who are politically connected? #ZumaQandA @News24Maimane: The only person who has benefitted from youth employment is your son, he claims. #ZumaQandA @News24Maimane up again to ask a supplimentary question on youth unemployment.#ZumaQandA @News24Zuma: there are numerous programmes focussed on youth employment. #ZumaQandA @News24Jeff Radebe is done with his book. Now P.H.O.N.E is required. #ZumaQandA @News24 pic.twitter.com/Mf1WLpSdAJZuma now moves on to answering ANC MP Fezeka Loliwe&#39;s question on the rise in the unemployment rate to 27.7%. #ZumaQandA @News24Zuma: Countries with technology on nuclear must bid to win govt contract for #nucleardeal. There are no pre-agreements. #ZumaQandA @News24Zuma wants to form a choir with his friend, DA&#39;s @DavidMaynier: &quot;You&#39;ll do the dancing, I&#39;ll do the singing.&quot; #ZumaQandA @News24&quot;There was nothing that found me involved in the Nkandla matter,&quot; says Zuma, oblivious to the ConCourt ruling of 31 March 2016 @News24Zuma: Nuclear is the cleanest and most reliable form in the energy mix. #ZumaQandA @News24Zuma says he knows nothing about any transaction involving any member of his family in the #nucleardeal. #ZumaQandA @News24Zuma starts answer by saying there was nothing in the Nkandla saga which found he was involved, only that he benefitted. #ZumaQandA @News24Maimane follows up. &quot;Please tell SA, have you or any member of your family received payment from the Russians.&quot; #nuclear #ZumaQandA @News24 Jump to top
