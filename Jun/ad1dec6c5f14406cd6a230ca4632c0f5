Mokushane did not respond to calls and SMSes requesting comment.Three sources told City Press that Mokushane was declined the security clearance he requires to do his job. Crime intelligence officers need the clearance to be allowed to view top secret documents containing highly sensitive information.Regarding his alleged affair with a junior officer&rsquo;s wife, Sapu Gauteng provincial chairperson Richard Mboweni confirmed that when the officer complained to the union, they told him they could not get involved because it was a personal matter.The husband&rsquo;s name is known to City Press.&ldquo;We however found it to be very immoral for [Mokushane] to abuse his position to cause problems in his junior&rsquo;s marriage,&rdquo; Mboweni said, adding that the union member was then referred to the police&rsquo;s employee health and wellness department for counselling.Mboweni said the couple&rsquo;s problems started when the officer unexpectedly returned home from the trip he had been sent on by Mokushane to find his boss at his house.&ldquo;He blocked the driveway and caught the two of them together and Mokushane tried to drive away but caused an accident,&rdquo; said Mboweni. &ldquo;He then opened a case in which he changed the accident scene and claimed the incident happened in Carletonville.&rdquo;Mokushane married the same woman in December.Meanwhile, a companies search shows that Mokushane&rsquo;s companies, one of which he co-owns with his brother Jabu, are being deregistered.Mokushane found himself in trouble with the unions and his rank-and-file officers last week when he ordered them to vacate crime intelligence&rsquo;s headquarters in Erasmuskloof, Pretoria, and move to police clusters in an attempt to get them to be more operational.The decision, which had the police spies up in arms because it meant they would blow their cover, was rescinded this week after officers threatened to go on strike, and unions threatened to go to court to stop it.Mokushane and his boss, Acting National Police Commissioner Lieutenant General Lesetja Mothiba, have begun a process to review the police ranks of MKMVA members.The review is intended to promote MK veterans to senior police posts.MKMVA chairperson Kebby Maphatsoe confirmed to City Press yesterday that Mokushane was a member in good standing.Explaining the rank review process, Maphatsoe said there had been &ldquo;imbalances in the past&rdquo; which resulted in many of their members being &ldquo;sidelined&rdquo;.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why there is a review of the ranks. The project is being led from the office of the deputy minister of police,&rdquo; he said.Mokushane is not the only officer with a shady past.In 2013, the Civilian Secretariat for Police revealed that 1 448 members who have criminal records that include murder, rape and corruption are still active members of the police service.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
