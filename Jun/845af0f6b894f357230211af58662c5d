Do you know how that could be?SB: No.PD: The first is, as you pointed out 17 February, the last 2014.PD: Mr Sibeko's name does not appear there, do you agree?SB: This would be, in my opinion, one of those false RICAs, as you can see there is a false subscriber name.PD: [Calls up RICA details of Mr Sibeko].PD: When was that cell no first registered?SB: I'd say 17 February 2010.PD: I'm not going to go through it all, but there are several names in the third column given as the subscriber.PD: The law also says that if you hand your SIM card to someone else, you have to transfer the card's RICA details.SB: That is correct.PD: If I can show you this exhibit, that refers to the RICA details of Vumazonke's phone.PD: Shows that the phone was RICA'ed to a different person.PD: And when you register you have to use proof of address and an ID document?SB: Yes.PD: You have already said that in practice you have found that this is not the case.SB: That is correct.PD: Can you explain to his lordship what the RICA details of a cellphone is?SB: Every law abiding citizen is supposed to have their cellphones registered to a particular person, but what we have seen in practice is that this is not the case.PD: So according to law, every cellphone has to be registered to a person?SB: Yes.PD: And you have investigated thousands of cases?SB: Yes.PD: And in the course of your duties you have traced cellphone numbers?SB: That is correct.PD: And your job is to combat crime?SB: Yes.PD: And one could say you are a very qualified detective?SB: Based on my years of experience one could say that.PD: And you are attached to the Hawks?SB: Organised Crime.PD: Also known as the Hawks?SB: Yes.PS: And you are now a detective?SB: Yes.PD: And how long have you been a detective?SB: Since 1996.MS: The state calls Shane Bosch to the stand.PD: How much experience do you have?SB: I joined the SAPS in 1989, so 28 years.MS: I apologise for the delay, I believe one of the accused arrived late.Panayiotou co-accused's prize turned out to be an arrest warrantThe Eastern Cape High Court in Port Elizabeth has heard how one of the co-accused in the Christopher Panayiotou case was tricked into giving his details to the police.Panayiotou and his co accused, Sinethemba Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko, are facing charges of conspiring, kidnapping, robbing and killing Jayde Panayiotou.She was abducted outside her townhouse complex in Kabega Park and later murdered in a field near KwaNobuhle on April 21, 2015.
