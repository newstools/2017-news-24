That triggered the country's worst financial crisis since a civil war ended in 1992.As a result of the revelations, several major donors to the state budget - including the International Monetary Fund and World Bank - suspended aid to the southern African nation.The IMF on Saturday welcomed the decision by prosecutors to release the information."The report summary provides useful information on how the loans were contracted and on assets purchased by the companies," it said.The loans were taken out in anticipation of a windfall from recently discovered natural gas deposits - but that has so far failed to materialise and the government is unable to pay them back.Mozambique's opposition has called for the loans to be cancelled.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
