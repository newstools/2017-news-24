We had so much fear and doubt that we would not be believed but we have a deep sense of gratitude to the judicial system of South Africa," Diamond said."Children have a safe place to come to where they will be believed. Whatever difficulties we faced are now worthwhile because we were able to change the law."READ: High Court strikes down 20-year 'expiry date' on prosecuting sexual offencesHighs and lowsThe 48-year-old said she and other victims faced a series of highs and lows, but: "When one [victim] was feeling low, we supported each other."Diamond and seven others claimed they were sexually assaulted by Frankel as long ago as 30 years before his death.They laid criminal charges in 2015, but their case never went ahead due to the limitation of the statute of prosecution.Frankel died of cancer in his Johannesburg home on April 13, 2017.
