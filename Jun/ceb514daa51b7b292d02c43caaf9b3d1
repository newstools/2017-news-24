This behavior will also have to be dealt with by the organisation.&rdquo;He said a press briefing was expected to be held at the provincial ANC offices at 11:00 to discuss the matter.News24 reported earlier that leaders of five of the six regions in the province are unhappy that some provincial executive committee members allegedly met in secret on Sunday morning to strip some of the regions of their powers.The group, comprising leaders of the Cape Town metro, Boland, Overberg, West Coast and Central regions, held an emergency press conference in Cape Town on Sunday.They claimed the PEC wants to disband the Cape Town metro leadership, and see the Boland region stripped of some its powers.They were not following procedure, and making unilateral decisions without consulting the regions and branches, the leaders said.The move is part of a larger plan to send their preferred delegates to the ANC's policy conference on Friday, they claimed, and they have been unfairly labelled the Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma faction. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
