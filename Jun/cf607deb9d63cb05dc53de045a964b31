They were captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war before being returned to Egypt under the 1979 Camp David Accords.A court had struck down the deal last April but another court upheld it.President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi went ahead with the deal even though it threatened to dent his popularity, and at a time that the government, grappling with austerity reforms that have fuelled inflation, is wary of protests.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
