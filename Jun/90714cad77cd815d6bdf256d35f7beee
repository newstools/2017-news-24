We arrived a few minutes ago," he said in a Facebook post. "We don't know what is happening but we are not bothered by processes," he added.Armed police officers at the Lusaka prison had earlier bundled Hichilema and five co-accused into a van and drove them to the city airport, according to his lawyer Jack Mwiimbu.Mwiimbu described his transfer to Kabwe, 150km north of Lusaka, as illegal."There was a court order that they should be at Lusaka prison but they have gone against it. He was forcibly removed from Lusaka prison," Mwiimbu told reporters outside Lusaka Central prison where Hichilema had been detained since April 11.The treason case against the wealthy self-made businessman who turned 55 on Sunday comes after Hichilema made a fifth unsuccessful bid for the presidency last year.He refused to recognise Lungu as president and has challenged the narrow poll defeat in court.Home Affairs minister Stephen Kampyongo did not answer his phone when called for a comment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
