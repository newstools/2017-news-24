Should he slip out of the ANC&rsquo;s policy conference at the beginning of July to attend the African Union Head of States summit in Addis Ababa &ndash; and risk losing some crucial survival battles back home?Or should he ditch the AU summit and convince his deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa, to stand in for him on the continental platform &ndash; and risk giving Ramaphosa an opportunity to connect with new friends ahead of the ANC&rsquo;s elective conference in December to lobby them for support to replace Zuma in the top spot?The AU has sent out a reminder to countries that they should not bother sending delegations to the July summit if these are headed by anything less than the country&rsquo;s president, deputy president or prime minister.Ministers or officials would not be allowed to fill the country&rsquo;s chair on the assembly floor during the heads of state summit.&nbsp; The seniority of the delegation is needed for better deliberations and quick and effective decision-making, as well as to maintain the gravitas of the gathering. Zuma&rsquo;s spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga on Tuesday said he wasn&rsquo;t sure whether Zuma would be going to the AU summit, but he would try to confirm. He said International Relations and Cooperation Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane was set to go.Another official, however, said Zuma would be going and he was likely to jet in and out, possibly on the same day. The ANC&rsquo;s policy conference is set to take place from June 30 to July 5, while the AU&rsquo;s head of states summit is on 3 and 4 July. Zuma usually attends for at least two days with two overnight stays. This is set to be the first summit after Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma left the AU Commission chair &ndash; officially to do ANC work back home, although unofficially she is said to have presidential ambitions too. South Africa has been accused of using the AU Commission chairpersonship as a continental springboard for Dlamini-Zuma&rsquo;s presidential campaign.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
