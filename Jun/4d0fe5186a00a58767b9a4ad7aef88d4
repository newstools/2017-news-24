If parents did not respond to the offer, it would be given to other parents waiting in the queue.Those who would miss the June 12 deadline were advised to take advantage of the department's Admissions Exhibition which has been set up at the Nasrec exhibition centre in commemoration of Youth Month.The largest number of applications was made for schools in the Johannesburg Region, followed by Ekurhuleni and Tshwane.Of those schools, 11 had received more than 1 200 applications in the last three weeks, he said. Ten of these schools were high schools.A total of 402 schools received less than 50 applications.Boksburg High School and Ho&euml;rskool Akasia were both in high demand, as they each received 1 525 applications, he said.Laerskool Akasia received 1 308 applications, the only primary school with more than 1 200 applications.The department would ensure that some learners were transferred to schools which experienced low application numbers, Lesufi said.He said he had noted that schools with low application numbers had perceptions attached to them which varied from poor quality of education, to schools situated in rural, township or distant areas where the uptake among parents was slow.Scholar transportation for learners who could not find placement close to their homes would be arranged, Lesufi added.Construction for more schools in areas with high pressure demands was in the process of being built.The department would also use the data collected on the site to plan for infrastructure provisioning of stationery, furniture as well as employment and allocation of educators, he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
