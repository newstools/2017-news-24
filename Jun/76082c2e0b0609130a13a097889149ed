According to the police they had been overcome by smoke. Wynand said Tony&rsquo;s parents, Thomas and Nielen Johnston from Uitenhage, became concerned on Wednesday morning when they couldn&rsquo;t get hold of their son. It apparently was tradition that they would sing a birthday song for Michael on his birthday. &ldquo;They also phoned Tony&rsquo;s boss in Knysna, only to be told that he hadn&rsquo;t pitched for work."According to Stander the employer drove to Johnston&rsquo;s house. On his way there he met up with police and they went to the house together, where they found the bodies. The employer tried to phone Johnston&rsquo;s parents, but the cellphone reception wasn&rsquo;t good. Just after breaking the news to them, the cellphone died. &nbsp;&ldquo;They immediately drove to Knysna,&rdquo; said Stander. There they confirmed with police that all three had died.Stander said the Johnstons were a close knit family. &ldquo;They loved one another,&ldquo; he said. A memorial service is to be held for the family at Humansdorp next week Thursday. The couple and their son will be cremated.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
