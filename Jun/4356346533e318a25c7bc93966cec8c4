He said that Ramaphosa, who was also the SADC facilitator, would proceed to the mountain kingdom for the inauguration. &nbsp;"The deputy president is aware of the developments," said&nbsp;Mamoepa, adding that "security forces" would ensure that the inauguration "runs smoothly".&nbsp;Lesotho plunged into a political crisis following a failed coup attempt in 2014, prompting Thabane to flee to South Africa, saying he feared for his life.Thabane returned home early this year&nbsp;with two other opposition leaders, vowing to win back power.&nbsp;In March this year, the mountain kingdom again faced a fresh crisis after parliament passed a&nbsp;vote of no confidence&nbsp;in outgoing Prime Minister Pakalithi Mosisili.This consequently paved way for the June 3 held election which saw Thabane&nbsp;winning 48 out of 120 parliamentary seats.International Relations and Co-operation Minister, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, warned on Sunday that SADC will not allow any military coup "in any [its] corner". &nbsp;"This was made very, very clear to everyone in Lesotho two weeks ago. They have just had an election a year and a half ago and they have also undertaken to go back to the reforms [on the role of the police and the military, which have been supporting leaders from opposing parties] which they themselves say has bedevilled focus on governance," she was quoted as saying.#Lesotho Kingdom of just over 2 million people faces turmoil.
