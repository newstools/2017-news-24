Converting conventional curing barns using improved furnace, insulation, chimney and flue modifications helps to reduce the amount of fuel needed to cure tobacco and improves overall energy efficiency.&nbsp;PMI is also moving towards more sustainable curing fuel sources and encourages fuel-switching to less polluting fuels such as the use of biomass &ndash; wood and crop residues such as nut shells and tree prunings &ndash; as an alternative fuel where appropriate.&nbsp; The potential of new technologies, such as solar energy in curing barns, is also being explored. &nbsp;&nbsp;By 2020, the company aims to have zero coal usage for tobacco curing and ensure no deforestation due to the growing and curing of the tobacco purchased.Tackling the issue of deforestation in Africa though requires a multi-pronged approach.Apart from improving curing barn design and technologies to make the process more efficient, planting trees to replenish deforested areas;&nbsp; implementing track and trace systems to ensure traceable sources of wood fuel; as well as assisting farmers to set up small-scale forestry operations are some of the ways companies are combating deforestation to actively reforest areas to replenish stocks.&nbsp;In 2015, PMI and its suppliers planted more than 29 million trees and implemented programmes to increase the total fuel consumed for tobacco curing from renewable energy sources.Further along the supply chain, each factory and facility uses different environmental approaches adapted according to local circumstances.&nbsp; For example, prioritising water conservation for facilities in water-scarce regions or first investing in renewable energy where it&rsquo;s available, cost-effective and provides supply security makes sense.&nbsp;This integrated approach to greening the tobacco supply chain is bearing fruit.&nbsp;The&nbsp;sustainable use&nbsp;of natural resources has become a top priority for the tobacco industry.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
