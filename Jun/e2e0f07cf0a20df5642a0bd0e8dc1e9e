Eben van Niekerk was on Tuesday expected to appear in the Stellenbosch Magistrate's Court in connection with the hijacking and subsequent attack on Cornelius and her friend Cheslin Marsh in Bird Street, Stellenbosch, on May 27. Van Niekerk faces charges of murder, kidnapping and rape, and made his first court appearance on May 30. National Prosecuting Authority provincial spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said Van Niekerk had, through his legal aid lawyer, indicated that he wished to bring a bail application, but later decided not to proceed. The matter was postponed to July 28, when he will appear alongside Nashwill Julies, Vernon Witbooi, 32, and Geraldo Parsons, 26. Cornelius' body was found on the side of the road, near a wine farm outside Stellenbosch.&nbsp; Her hijacked Citi Golf was also allegedly used in an armed robbery in Northpine, between Brackenfell and Kraaifontein, and police made their first arrests after a dramatic car chase. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
