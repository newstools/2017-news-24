Most of the victims lived in the shack communities which cling to hillsides that become unstable in heavy rain.A previous toll put the number of dead at 11 with several hundred more affected. The heavy rains also led to the collapse of a bridge into the southern city of San-Pedro, cutting it off for several days. The city hosts the second largest port in Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer. The government pointed blame for the heavy rains on "climate change and structures in high-risk areas despite the warning of previous public information campaigns."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
