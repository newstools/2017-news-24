Safety and security mayoral committee member JP Smith said 870 structures had been destroyed while more than 2 500 people had been affected by water-logged homes. More than 100 people have been displaced and would be spending the night at community halls while more than 100 homeless people had also sought shelter at night havens. Smith said about 100 trees were uprooted, which resulted in several blocked roads and snapped power lines. Several coastal roads were closed due to high tide.&nbsp; About 148 homeless people have been encouraged to take shelter as the weather is expected to last throughout the night with rain also being forecast for tonight [Wednesday]. The storm is expected to carry on until 06:00 [on Thursday], he said.

"Water users are reminded that water is only permitted for essential use, irrespective of the rainfall that is being experienced," the city said in a statement on Wednesday. It said water users "must continue to reduce their water usage to less than 100 litres per person per day in total, wherever they are. "The much-anticipated cold front which has made landfall is not a quick ticket out of the drought situation. It will take at least three consecutive winters of above-average rainfall to make a real difference."&nbsp;Residents were also urged to, where possible, use suitable containers to capture rainwater.&nbsp;#CapeStorm Intermittent Rain across the city - roads wet, slippery and dangerous at high speeds #SlowDown #DriveSAfeLatest #CapeStorm: approx. 2500 people affected by heaving rain &amp; strong winds over past 48 hrs. 90% of electricity outages being restored.Winds weren&#39;t as strong last night.
