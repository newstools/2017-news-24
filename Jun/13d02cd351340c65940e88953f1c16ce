	     Groblersdal – A 29-year-old taxi driver and his girlfriend were arrested after they allegedly faked his kidnapping outside Groblersdal in Limpopo, police said on Thursday. Lieutenant Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said that the man went to his 31-year-old girlfriend in the Hlogotlou Police precinct, outside Groblersdal on Monday afternoon.  Ngoepe said the driver told the woman to inform the owner of the taxi that he had been kidnapped by unknown men driving three cars without number plates.  His girlfriend opened a kidnapping case at Hlogotlou police station on Monday evening.  "The police detectives started the initial investigations immediately and subsequently the taxi driver was found hiding inside this girlfriend's house and they were both arrested," Ngoepe said. The duo will appear in the Nebo Magistrate's Court on Friday.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
