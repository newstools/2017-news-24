"One 2-month-old baby seen by my team had been hit by two bullets four hours after birth; the mother was also wounded. At least two pregnant women were sliced open and their fetuses mutilated."The government will soon publish its own report on the crisis, Congolese government spokesperson Lambert Mende told The Associated Press on Tuesday."Beyond verifying whether these figures are true or not, it demonstrates that this is a real security situation that must absolutely lead to an appropriate government reaction to put an end to this," he said.The region in central DRC exploded into violence after a traditional chief known as Kamwina Nsapu was killed in a military operation in August 2016 after his militants had revolted against Congolese authorities.The subsequent fighting had previously been blamed for 400 deaths before the Catholic church released the figure of 3 300 on Tuesday. Among the victims were two foreign UN experts- American Michael Sharp and Zaida Catalan, a Swedish-Chilean national.Militants loyal to Nsapu filmed themselves killing the two, who had been investigating allegations of human rights abuses in the area. Their bodies were later found in a shallow grave along with the body of their Congolese colleague. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
