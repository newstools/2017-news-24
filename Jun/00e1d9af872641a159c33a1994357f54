When it was introduced, it was at a fully imported price of R220 000. It is now however locally produced at R450 000 before interest, which the industry feels is too expensive, Santaco said.According to the organisation&rsquo;s calculations, one Toyota Quantum costs more than R1m when the deposit, interest rate, instalments, premiums and insurance have been considered."The march in Gauteng [last week] was directed at SA Taxi Finance for overcharging us in terms of interest," he said.Both the KZN and Gauteng marches saw major routes and highways around both the provinces blocked.Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane told News24 that they are aware of the looming taxi strike.Police will be deployed accordingly to monitor the looming taxi strike, he said."We are also appealing to the taxi owners to obey the rules of the law and not obstruct any traffic from any roads," Zwane said.Those who will act outside the law will be caught and arrested, he warned."Taxi owners need to respect the rights of other road users who are not part of any march or protests," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
