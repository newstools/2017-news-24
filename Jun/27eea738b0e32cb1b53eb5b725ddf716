Eighty lawmakers are voted in by constituents, while another 40 seats are distributed proportionally.A party needs more than 61 of the 120 seats available to rule without being forced into a coalition.Reflecting frustration at the country's politics, voter turnout has declined sharply from 66 percent in 2002 to just 46% in 2015.Security forces&nbsp;Analysts like Fogelman have called for electoral reforms to boost support for democracy and to avoid ill-fated coalition governments that survive only a few years.The 2014 attempted coup against Thabane was allegedly led by army chief Tlali Kamoli. Soldiers attacked police headquarters, looted weapons and killed one officer.There were successful coups in 1986 and 1991.Motlamelle Kapa, a political analyst at the National University of Lesotho, said that politics were being undermined by the security forces."There needs to be a total depoliticisation of the security agencies, which are often used to fight political battles," Kapa told AFP."The security forces are at the core of the country's political challenges. They tend to side with individuals."South Africa is often criticised for allegedly interfering in Lesotho, which gained independence from Britain in 1966.The country, which suffers a 22.7% adult HIV rate, exports textiles but many citizens seek work in South Africa.Lesotho citizens, known as Basotho, are famed for their horse-riding skills, and many people in rural areas use ponies as their daily mode of transport.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
