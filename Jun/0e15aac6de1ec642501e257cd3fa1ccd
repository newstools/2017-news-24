His trial started in August 2015."It is not the right of the accused to be out on bail. The victims have the right to their justice, as well as society," Persad said at the time.Persad said the victims were at risk.De Villiers's new lawyer, Riaan Greyling, told the court that it was unfair to blame his client for the delay.On February 8, Moosa found De Villiers guilty on 32 of 38 charges, including raping a child, sexual assault, fraud, exposing children to pornography, and accessing child pornography.Moosa called De Villiers a poor witness and said his version of events had too many contradictions.De Villiers claimed the State witnesses had lied and conspired with M-Net's Carte Blanche programme to harm the reputations of himself and his modelling agency.The matter was postponed to June 27. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
