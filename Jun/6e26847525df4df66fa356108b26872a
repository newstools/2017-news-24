All these attributes have made Botswana, and you Mr President, a natural and capable leader of the region's collective efforts towards growth and development, within the framework of SADC. We also value your leadership in the region's efforts to promote peace and stability on our sub-continent and further afield."Masire was the president of Botswana&nbsp;from 1980 to 1998.He led various diplomatic initiatives in Africa, including chairing a panel that investigated the 1994 Rwanda genocide, and co-ordinating the Inter-Congolese National Dialogue."In all these spheres, South Africa stands ready to work with Botswana and other neighbours to attain the best for our peoples."In his honour, the Nelson Mandela Foundation will continue to work with the Sir Ketumile Masire Foundation through the "Caring4Girls" Initiative in Botswana, and Mandela Day Libraries in an effort to deepen work he was passionate about to further youth development," read the statement.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
