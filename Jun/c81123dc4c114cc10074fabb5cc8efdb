In 2011, a military court sentenced a senior police officer to death and jailed a police captain for life over the murder, but four years later, following an appeal, the death sentence was commuted to 15 years jail and the captain acquitted. "It's authentic, it's an official decree," a staff member working at the official government gazette told AFP in reference to the document posted online. Over the years, Chebeya became highly critical of the regime of Kabila, who was propelled into office in 2001 by Kinshasa politicians after his father Laurent-Desire Kabila was assassinated while the country was at war.In September 2016, Washington placed Numbi on a blacklist of undesirable persons, describing him as "an influential advisor to President Kabila".During a ceremony in Paris on June 2 to mark the seventh anniversary of Chebeya's murder and Bazana's suspected murder, their families said they remained hopeful that the truth would emerge.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
