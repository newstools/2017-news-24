Critics say the islands were transferred in exchange for billions of dollars of Saudi aid.&nbsp;Authorities earlier this month arrested an estimated 120 people who voiced opposition to the agreement or demonstrated against it in street protests. Most have since been released.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
