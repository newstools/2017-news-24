	     City Press investigative reporter Sipho Masondo won the prestigious Nat Nakasa Award for Media Integrity at the SA National Editors’ Forum annual general meeting in Durban last night.  The award is presented to a South African journalist whose reporting celebrates freedom of speech and media integrity. Masondo was recognised for his work on the Watergate scandal for the past year, during which he declined a total of R3.5m offered to him in bribes by representatives of the department of water affairs and sanitation, as well as a job that earns in the region of R900 000 a year, if he would drop his investigation.  He was also recognised for declining a bribe during his investigation on missing Anglo Platinum mine workers’ pension funds, during which a senior official at the investment company approached him and told him they could not afford for the story to be published, and told him to “name your price” to make it go away. Masondo paid a heavy price for his integrity and was faced with threats on his life (see ‘Ben 10’ complaint against City Press fails).  City Press was forced to immediately step up security around Masondo and his family.  He was also subjected to a paid twitter campaign to discredit him and ruin his reputation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
