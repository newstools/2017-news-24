On May 24 he had barred from reporting or publishing any information that might emerge from Mantsoe's bail application.The ruling stated that the media was only allowed to publish and report on the judgment of the bail application.Lindi Nkosi Thomas, of the National Director of Public Prosecutions, asked that the motion be postponed to June 23 for arguments.Thomas, who was handling the motion application,&nbsp;said she and defence lawyer Tumisang Katake will file their affidavits by June 16 and Times Media had to respond by June 21. State prosecutor John Metswamere and Katake have agreed that Mantsoe's bail application be postponed to allow the National Prosecuting Authority to fight for the continued media ban.Labuschagne said he was concerned that Mantsoe's rights would be infringed by the delays caused by the media ban fight.Mokoena's body was found disposed of in an open veld in Bramley on April 29. She had been burnt beyond recognition, and was only identified through DNA. Previously, Mantsoe was described as being deeply religious, quiet, and calm. Fellow congregation members described him as an evangelist, and a God-fearing man who would preach at church, saying that what had happened was a result of the devil attacking him for doing the work of the Lord. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
