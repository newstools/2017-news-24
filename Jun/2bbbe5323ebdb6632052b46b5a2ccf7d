The woman, Florah Moatshe, 23, from Mahlasedi village, went missing on April 29, 2017, after having a fight with her ex-boyfriend. More than a month later her body was discovered in the shallow grave. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said a relentless effort led to the arrest of the suspect, 31, and the subsequent discovery of Moatshe's body. The suspect is expected to appear in the Lephalale Magistrate's Court soon on charges including murder and kidnapping. Police investigations are continuing. News24 understand that more than four women were killed by their partners over the past three months. Ngoepe said police were disturbed by the ongoing violence against women. "The South African Police Service in Limpopo condemns the prevalence of the incidents of missing persons, especially women, who are later found murdered," said Ngoepe.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
