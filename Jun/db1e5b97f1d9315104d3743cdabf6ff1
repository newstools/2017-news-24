"We as hosts are very disappointed with this behaviour. This must stop forthwith," Home Affairs and Internal Security Minister Grace Chiumia said in a statement."We are here to secure and protect you and when you start fighting because of grudges you have against each other back home, we as hosts are very disappointed with this behaviour."

The paper cited police as saying two murder cases had been opened.But a district police spokesperson Richard Kaponda dismissed the reports."It's not true about the infighting, but there was an isolated incident in which a Burundian attacked a Congolese national at a drinking joint," Kaponda told AFP.Ethnic tensions between Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups led to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda in which around 800 000 mostly Tutsi people were killed.Dzaleka camp, situated 40km from Lilongwe, is home to about 29 000 refugees from Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Somalia and Sudan.
