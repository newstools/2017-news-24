Authorities on both sides are passing each other the buck," said Noureddine Benissad of the Algerian League of Human Rights.Saida Benhabiles, the head of the Algerian Red Crescent, said a joint team from her organisation and the UN refugee agency have been waiting on the Algerian border since late on Monday."There's no obstacle on the Algerian side," she said. "But the problem is they're in Moroccan territory and we can't go to get them."In a statement, non-governmental groups including the Moroccan Association of Human Rights, International Federation for Human Rights and the Algerian League of Human Rights urged "authorities in both countries to find an immediate solution".The zone between the two countries has been closed since 1994. The North African rivals have very difficult relations, especially over the question of Western Sahara.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
