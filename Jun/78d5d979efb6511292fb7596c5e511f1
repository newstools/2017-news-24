The presidency has dismissed reports he was dying and even dead.Imo state governor Rochas Okorocha, who heads the governors' forum of Buhari's All Progressives Congress (APC) party, on Thursday dismissed Fayose's comments.He told reporters in Abuja that the comments were "baseless" and accused him of "heating up the polity" by playing politics with Buhari's health."We must at this point give every support to Mr President and we are hoping that very soon Mr President will come back to us," he added.Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo has officially been handed the role of acting president, in accordance with the constitution.But Buhari's absence has brought forward behind-the-scenes jostling for position for the 2019 presidential election at which the president is unlikely to stand.In 2010, Nigeria was plunged into months of political turmoil after president Umaru Musa Yar'Adua died in office following months of treatment abroad.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
