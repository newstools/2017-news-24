	     Bloemfontein - Bloem Water has cut its water supply to Manguang to 30% over an R340m outstanding debt. Water shortages were expected to occur on Tuesday evening. Democratic Alliance councillor Rossouw Botes has urged Manguang residents to use water sparingly. "If we all do our part, there should still be enough water for everybody. Please do not stockpile water in baths, containers etc, as this will empty the reservoirs and cause water shortages," Botes said. The affected areas are Bloemfontein, Dewetsdorp, Wepener, Van Stadensrus, Soutpan, Botshabelo and Thaba Nchu. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
