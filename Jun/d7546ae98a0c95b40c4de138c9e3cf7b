The man is expected to appear in the Cape Town Magistrate&rsquo;s Court tomorrow (Wednesday). The arrest followed a tip off received early on Monday about a person that was selling drugs at an address in Coronation Road. Maitland police spokesperson Constable Lorencial Johnson says the Cape Town cluster task team followed up on the information. The man was found in a backroom of the identified house flushing packets of a powder substance down the toilet. Johnson says members of the task team confiscated the remaining packets. "The members were quick to stop the man from flushing all the packets and managed to recover some of it. It was later found that the packets contained cocaine powder to the value of R9800. An undisclosed amount of cash was also seized from the room as it is believed to possibly be the proceeds of the drug dealings," says Johnson. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
