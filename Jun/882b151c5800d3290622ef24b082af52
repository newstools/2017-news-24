A single dad since he was 19, he has relied a lot on his own mother, Amanda, whom he still lives with in Welkom in the Free State.&ldquo;My mother takes all the credit,&rdquo; he says. Although his job as a DJ is demanding, he ensures he bonds with his son whenever he is home.&ldquo;I am close to my son. He calls me Tau,&rdquo; he says. Katleho, he says, is a responsible young lad. &ldquo;Even though I want to help him bath and do his homework, he always wants to do everything for himself.&rdquo;Katleho was only one when his parents broke up and he goes to his mum during school holidays.Motsamai says his son doesn&rsquo;t know any other women in his life: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll introduce a woman to him the day I decide to marry her.&rdquo;Motsamai, who dropped out of high school, says it wasn&rsquo;t easy to take care of his son when he was unemployed, but he didn&rsquo;t expect raising Katleho to be a walk in the park. &ldquo;I remember at some point I was struggling to provide food and clothes for him. One day I looked at him, he looked unhealthy and he was too skinny."I was heartbroken because there wasn&rsquo;t anything I could do then,&rdquo; he remembers. His family couldn&rsquo;t help much because his mum was unemployed and his father had died. He tried to look for a job, but nothing came along.&ldquo;I had tried everything, so the option I had was to pack my bags and run away from home to be a street kid, because I was tired of watching my mother and son starve."I knew that I had to move out of my comfort zone and do something,&rdquo; he says. Motsamai was homeless for three years, but started to DJ at different nightclubs &ndash; and that&rsquo;s when his life changed for the better. &ldquo;I did this for my son,&rdquo; he says. In 2015, he got his big break in the music industry. His debut track, Better Days, is a reflection on his life. &ldquo;I hope my son doesn&rsquo;t become a DJ. Starting a career as a DJ isn&rsquo;t easy at all, it comes with its challenges.&rdquo;But two things he learnt from his father that he would like to pass on to his son, are to &ldquo;know God and to stay grounded&rdquo;.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
