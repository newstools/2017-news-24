US embassy Harare will lift the restriction when all issues have been verifiably addressed according to international standards," McGuire was quoted as saying. Reports last month indicated that the European Commission had barred Air Zimbabwe from flying to Europe over safety concerns.&nbsp;The European Commission maintains an Air Safety List of airlines that they say don&rsquo;t meet international safety standards and are barred from operating in the European Union.The commission named Air Zimbabwe - regularly used by President Robert Mugabe on his overseas trips - as one of four airlines added to the list "due to unaddressed safety deficiencies that were detected by the European Safety Agency". All five of Air Zimbabwe's planes were grounded in April, according to&nbsp;Zimbabwe Independent. It was&nbsp;not clear whether all five are now back in the skies. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
