Watch.WATCHKimberley - Brand new police vehicles have been parked under a tree at Kimberley&rsquo;s dog unit for two months, despite there being an urgent need for their use, Netwerk24 reported. Police officers say they&rsquo;ve heard that a general has to hand over the vehicles to the different units during an official ceremony. However, the general&rsquo;s schedule apparently is so full, that he can&rsquo;t fit this in. &nbsp; "Meanwhile, the vehicles are being damaged. It is ridiculous that the vehicles can&rsquo;t be distributed to units which are desperately in need of them." Police spokesperson, Brigadier Mohale Ramatseba, said the vehicles hadn&rsquo;t been distributed yet because internal administrative processes had to be completed. "As soon as this had been done, the vehicles will be allocated to police stations and other units. "People in the Northern Cape can rest assured that the administrative processes won't affect police work at all." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
