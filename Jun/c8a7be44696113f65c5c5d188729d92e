Our councillors noticed that many panes of glass were broken and requested that all broken panes be replaced. The managers who accompanied us agreed to do so," said Barker.Department spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo confirmed that seven students had been suspended."Yes, we&rsquo;ve suspended the students for making noise there. It&rsquo;s the policy of the department. They were not the first students to be suspended," he said.Kupelo said they&rsquo;ve set aside R500 000 to do minor renovations at the college.He said the suspension of the students and the money that was set aside were done long before the DA visit. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
