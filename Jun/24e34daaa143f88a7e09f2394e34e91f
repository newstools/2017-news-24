"These are not insurmountable problems, but they're frustrations."The internet cafe where Abiy Tesfaye works in Addis Ababa's busy Piazza neighbourhood runs off mobile data and only one customer was using one of his 14 computers.The business has been suffering for years as more and more people browse the internet with smartphones, Abiy said, and the internet shutdown was the latest blow."We lose money, we don't have the customers. It's a shame," he said.Around the corner, Dereje Alemayehu Nida's cafe was doing a brisk business in people filling out visa applications and surfing Facebook, but that's only because his broadband internet access came back online over the weekend after days without connectivity."It would have been better if they used another means to control the exams rather than shut down the internet," Dereje said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
