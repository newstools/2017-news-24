The rushed transfer came after the health department's contract with Life Esidimeni was not renewed.While releasing his report earlier in 2017, health ombudsman Malegapuru Makgoba said that the 27 NGOs where the patients were transferred were under-resourced, under-financed and under-prepared to take on the influx of mentally ill patients. Some of them were found to not have licenses. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
