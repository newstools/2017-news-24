"Witnesses coming from different neighborhoods say they have had to climb over dozens of bodies that now litter the ground."Mayor Maurice Balekouzou and others put the preliminary death toll at around 100, while several dozen wounded were seeking treatment at the local hospital run by aid group Doctors Without Borders.Witnesses said the fighting erupted early Tuesday between the anti-Balaka militia and rebels from the group known as FPRC who were once part of the Seleka movement.The peace deal signed Monday in Rome among nearly all of the country's armed groups had called for an immediate cease-fire. Many were skeptical, however, because previous agreements had quickly failed.Central African Republic has faced deadly interreligious and intercommunal fighting since 2013, when predominantly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power in the capital, Bangui. Mostly Christian anti-Balaka militias fought back, resulting in thousands of people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced.The country saw a period of relative peace in late 2015 and 2016, but violence has returned in recent months, especially outside the capital. The Seleka group has splintered into factions, some of them fighting each other.Bria has seen repeated clashes since May, leaving dozens dead.
