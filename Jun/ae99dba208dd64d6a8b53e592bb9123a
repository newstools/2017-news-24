People have died in KZN, councillors have been killed. Once you start making physical threats then that means you have run out of ideas," he said.Nzimande said the rate at which the ANC was declining, the party may not retain its electoral majority in 2019 and that further organisational fragmentation cannot be ruled out.The SACP is preparing for its elective conference in July, at which it would likely decide whether or not to contest the 2019 elections on its own, instead of backing the ANC. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
