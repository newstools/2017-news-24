The walls of the hospital still had pro-rebel graffiti."Only yesterday a child died," a Unicef worker said.Jebel Marra saw pitched battles last year between government forces and the SLA/AW group, which Khartoum accuses of ambushing military convoys and attacking civilians.In September, Amnesty International accused Sudanese forces of carrying out chemical attacks during military operation against the rebel group.'Big assistance'&nbsp;Sudanese officials including President Omar al-Bashir have denied these charges.Tens of thousands of people were displaced in Jebel Marra in last year's fighting, the United Nations says.United States' top envoy in Sudan, Steven Koutsis (C), poses for a photograph next to North Darfur deputy governor Mohamed al-Nabi (C-L) and other officials.(AFP)&nbsp;Deadly conflict broke out in Darfur in 2003 when ethnic minority groups took up arms against Bashir's Arab-dominated government, which launched a brutal counter-insurgency.
