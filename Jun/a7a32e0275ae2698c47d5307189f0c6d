British company Tullow announced the discovery of oil in Kenya in March 2012. Since then reserves totalling 750 million barrels have been found.A pilot programme trucking 2 000 barrels a day by road from Turkana to Mombasa, more than 1 000km, was planned from June. Upgrades on the congested and badly maintained roads are also behind schedule.The oil will be trucked until the construction of a 900km pipeline to a new port to be constructed at Lamu on the Indian Ocean coast, only due to start next year and be completed in 2020.The early oil export is seen as a way to test the market before rolling out the expected 100 000 barrels a day when the pipeline has been built.While government insists the pilot programme will be profitable, observers told AFP in March it would actually lose money due to the small volumes exported and low oil prices, and predicted the scheme would be delayed.The delay is a blow to Kenya's ruling party ahead of the election, with the first export of oil having been seen as a major boon to their campaign for re-election. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
