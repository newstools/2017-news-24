These are the three categories I would like to hear about," he said.A first revolt broke out in January and flared again in May before being calmed by promises of a bonus. Many of those who mutinied were former rebels who joined the army in 2011, as peace returned after a decade-long war that had split the country in two.Ivory Coast has an army numbering around 22 000 soldiers, but falling cocoa prices have severely crimped the government's finances.Last year, the government unveiled an ambitious plan to modernise the military, part of which would involve the departure of several thousand men, particularly ex-rebels, who will not be replaced.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
