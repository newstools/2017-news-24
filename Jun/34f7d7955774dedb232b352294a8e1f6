I was glad to be safe but needed oxygen to recover.&rdquo;Wilhelmina Stuurman (46) another resident affected in the fire says:&nbsp;&ldquo;We were sleeping and my sister in-law woke us to say the place is burning.&nbsp;&ldquo;My son opened the door for us and we ran out. Everyone else was still inside and they had to jump over the wall through the roof to get out.&rdquo;Grade 12 learner, Andre Roman (17), says she is worried about her studies and hopes that educational officials will be able to help her.An official who could not be named, from the City of Cape Town was at the scene and said they would probably start delivering material by tomorrow and for now they are busy investigating and making plans to clear the area.Community leader, Colleen Jacobs says it is the first time the shacks in that yard were burnt and now the community was busy trying to make arrangements to get them a temporal shelter.&nbsp;She asked for donations from anyone who can help with food parcels, clothes and blankets to visit the victims at 18th Avenue or contact Jimmy at 073 &thinsp;2803&thinsp;276. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
