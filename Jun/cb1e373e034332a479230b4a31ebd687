A police official at the Torah jail south of Cairo confirmed the tycoon had been freed.Tamim, Moustafa's lover, was murdered in July 2008 at her Dubai apartment by former policeman Mohsen al-Sukkari.The court which sentenced Moustafa to jail accused him of having paid Sukkari $2m to cut Tamim's throat. Sukkari was sentenced to 25 years in prison.Tamim's killing sparked an outcry in the region, particularly in Egypt where Moustafa was a respected figure and a businessman associate of ousted president Hosni Mubarak's son and heir apparent Gamal.Moustafa was also a member of Mubarak's now-dissolved National Democratic Party.In May 2009, Moustafa was sentenced to jail but a year later an appeals court overturned the verdict on procedural grounds and ordered a retrial. In 2010 he was handed a 15-year prison sentence.State television said those pardoned by Sisi included people jailed in connection with "demonstrations". It did not elaborate.In July 2013, Egypt's army, then headed by Sisi, ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi who had succeeded Mubarak, and launched a crackdown on Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood.The crackdown saw hundreds of demonstrators killed and thousands jailed, including secular dissidents.In the aftermath of the crackdown authorities also banned all but police-approved protests.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
