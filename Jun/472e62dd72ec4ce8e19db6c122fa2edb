Colleagues patrolling outside came back to the centre around 04:00 and discovered the bodies of Constables Obert Boitumelo Mekoa and Mzonani David Manjo, both 32, said Brigadier Motantsi Makhele. Mekoa had been shot in the head, while Manjo was shot in the neck and back. One of their pistols was missing. A case of murder and armed robbery was being investigated by a joint team, led by the Hawks. "This is one of the saddest days for the police in the Free State, and I would like to send our condolences as the organisation to both Mekoa and Manjo's families," said provincial commissioner, Lieutenant-General Lebeoana Jacob Tsumane.

A police station in Cape Town also came under attack on Wednesday. Three armed men entered the Lingelethu West police station, ostensibly to report a robbery, and started shooting. A police officer retaliated and shot back. He was wounded in the exchange of fire, but was in a stable condition in hospital. The suspects were still on the run. Police Minister Fikile Mbalula said the perpetrators would be held accountable for their actions. "Police are protectors of communities and we will not allow these kinds of acts to undermine the authority of the state." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
