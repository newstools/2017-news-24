A police spokesperson confirmed that the Matete court was attacked but did not provide further details. The raid comes three weeks after dozens of prisoners escaped Kinshasha's largest jail following a rebel attack on the facility. The May 17 jailbreak was carried out by followers of Bundu Dia Kongo (BDK), a secessionist rebel group that rejects Kinshasa's authority and wants to set up a parallel state in the west of the country.Another attack on a prison two days later saw 68 inmates escape a prison in Kasangulu, 40km southwest of Kinshasa.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
