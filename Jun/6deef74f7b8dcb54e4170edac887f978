The assault comes after he was accused of raping a child. In the video circulating on social media, people are seen beating the man with wooden planks as he sits on the ground. He appears to be dressed in only a t-shirt, and his penis is tied with string to a pole next to him. A woman at one point says she had beaten him "enough" with a hammer on his genitals. People kick the man, who has numerous facial wounds, while the crowd also threatens to set him alight. A child can also be seen on a woman's hip, witnessing the attack. Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut confirmed the incident. "It is alleged by the community that he sexually assaulted a child, but police have no record of any sexual cases in Valhalla Park or any rape suspect who is sought," he said. Family transported the man to hospital and police, but he refused to open a case. "We are looking into the circumstances surrounding the matter," Traut said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
