"As of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country," Trump said.Trump complained that the deal, which was signed under his predecessor, Barack Obama, gives other countries an unfair advantage over US industry and destroys American jobs."So we're getting out but we'll start to negotiate and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair. And if we can, that's great. And if we can't, that's fine," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
