	     Johannesburg – The case involving Freedom Under Law (FUL) and the National Director of Public Prosecutions Authority’s Nomgcobo Jiba was on Tuesday postponed to October 30 and 31. FUL made an application to the North Gauteng High Court to review the decision of the NDPP to withdraw charges of perjury and fraud against Jiba.    FUL also asked the court to declare President Jacob Zuma’s failure to institute an inquiry into the conduct of Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi, the Special Director of Public Prosecutions, unlawful and to direct the president to institute such an inquiry. The case involves FUL, Jiba, the National Prosecuting Authority, Minister of Justice Michael Masutha, Zuma and Mrwebi. Jiba and Mrweni were previously struck from the roll of advocates by the Pretoria High Court in relation to, among other things, their conduct in another Freedom Under Law application. In February, it was reported that Zuma had decided not to suspend Jiba and Mrwebi or to institute an inquiry into their fitness to hold office. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
