It blamed flawed contracts unfavourable to the state.The information ministry said that Mawio had made the accusations against the former leaders when neither of two commissions set up by Magufuli to probe the affair had blamed them for anything.The weekly was ordered to suspend publication of both its print edition and the internet edition for 24 months from the date of notification.Following publication of reports on the mining sector, Magufuli ordered the revision of laws on the allocation of mining contracts and asked prosecutors to question - and even charge - ministers of mining and of justice found to have signed contracts harmful to state interests in recent years.Magufuli accused Canadian mining giant Barrick Gold of "stealing from us" in a live televised address this week, but welcomed discussions when the firm's CEO John Thornton flew to Tanzania on Wednesday.Mawio has already faced a government ban for its coverage of a political crisis after elections late in December 2015 in the semi-autonomous Zanzibar islands. That ban was lifted by the courts.Tanzania has rich stocks of minerals. Apart from gold, the country exports copper, nickel, silver, diamonds and other precious stones such as tanzanite.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
