The statement by Annan and nine former presidents says a political deal reached in December calling for elections this year — and without President Joseph Kabila as a candidate — is not being respected. The statement says DRC's future "is in grave danger" and that the crisis threatens both the vast, mineral-rich Central African country and the continent at large. Deadly protests broke out in December as Kabila reached the end of his mandate. The opposition has accused the government of delaying elections to keep him in power. The government has said vote preparations need more time. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
