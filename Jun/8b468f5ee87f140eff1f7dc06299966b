(Lizeka Tandwa, News24 Multimedia &nbsp; &nbsp; User Galleries &nbsp; &nbsp; News in Pictures Send us your pictures &nbsp; &nbsp; Send us your stories Johannesburg - The Constitutional Court will make its ruling on Thursday on the UDM's application to force National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete to conduct the vote of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma by secret ballot.&nbsp; After Zuma&rsquo;s controversial Cabinet reshuffle at the end of March, that saw Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan axed, among others, the opposition asked Mbete to schedule a vote of no confidence in Zuma.It was initially set down for April 18. The opposition however asked for it to be postponed pending the application to the court for the vote to take place in secret.Opposition parties hope this would encourage enough ANC MPs to vote against Zuma for it to succeed.UDM leader Bantu Holomisa had argued that Zuma&rsquo;s reshuffle led to two ratings agencies downgrading the country&rsquo;s debt to junk status. In addition, he said MPs had been threatened with losing their seats and with violence if they voted against him.Mbete previously said the UDM&rsquo;s application had no merit and it did not fall within the court's exclusive jurisdiction.She said if the court found she had the power to order a motion of no confidence via secret ballot, she would act in accordance with its ruling.#SecretBallotJudgement by #ConCourt is scheduled for 10am on Thursday , 22/6/17.&mdash; Bantu Holomisa (@BantuHolomisa) June 20, 2017#SecretBallotJudgement by #ConCourt is scheduled for 10am on Thursday , 22/6/17.Breaking: ConCourt to give Judgment on the Application for #SecretBallot this Thursday, 22 June, 2017 at 10h00. #ZumaMustFall ???&mdash; EFF Official Account (@EFFSouthAfrica) June 20, 2017Breaking: ConCourt to give Judgment on the Application for #SecretBallot this Thursday, 22 June, 2017 at 10h00. #ZumaMustFall ???#ConCourt: judgement will be handed down on Thursday at 10am on motion of no confidence. #SecretBallot (UDM vs Speaker of National Assembly) pic.twitter.com/XWwNBqnCuH&mdash; Constitution Hill SA (@VisitConHill) June 20, 2017#ConCourt: judgement will be handed down on Thursday at 10am on motion of no confidence. #SecretBallot (UDM vs Speaker of National Assembly) pic.twitter.com/XWwNBqnCuHJudgment in UDM v Speaker of the National Assembly and Others is due to be given in #ConCourt on Thursday. #WatchThisSpace #SecretBallot pic.twitter.com/xbAxj7fz2J&mdash; SAFLII (@saflii) June 20, 2017Judgment in UDM v Speaker of the National Assembly and Others is due to be given in #ConCourt on Thursday. #WatchThisSpace #SecretBallot pic.twitter.com/xbAxj7fz2J24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
