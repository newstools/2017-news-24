And that street-cred, struggle credentials and big brown eyes can only get you so far.At least, that has been the experience of two puppies that were found within minutes of each other on the streets of Cape Town, with no place to call home and without a loving owner in sight.They were taken in by the Animal Welfare Society Helderberg.It was quite by coincidence that the pair was named after the Cape Town mayor and the Western Cape premier.Manager Julia Evans said this week that when she asked staff for names, someone shouted out Patricia."Almost immediately someone else said Helen."The two had, until recently, shared a kennel.In a "tail" of two cities, Helen was adopted and left the shelter to start her new life of luxury.It was not clear if her new owners decided to keep her name.Now Patricia, who will be medium sized when fully grown, is hoping for the same happy ending.&nbsp;Her human counterpart, the mayor, is cheering her from the sidelines.As a dog lover with four Siberian huskies, De Lille said she was humbled that someone chose to name the cute dog after her."I love animals, they are near and dear to my heart and are the best companions we can ever have. They bring so much joy and they don&rsquo;t back chat," she told News24."I encourage people to adopt this little gem and give her a loving home."Great with other dogs and children, the pup&rsquo;s ideal home would be where she has someone around her during the day and can escape the icy Cape winds by sleeping inside at night.Her advert on Facebook describes her as a "happy, playful, friendly and fun little girl with a heart of gold and a very positive attitude".As with citizens looking for a home, De Lille said it would make a huge impact in their efforts to be a caring city if more pets were housed.She encouraged people to visit animal shelters and find a "fury treasure" to add to the family.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
