That mission evolved into the current Barkhane deployment launched in 2014 with an expanded mandate for counter-terror operations across the Sahel.&nbsp;International support?&nbsp;Macron is hoping that the $57.2m the European Union has pledged to the Sahel force will be supplemented by extra support from Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the United States, which already has a drone base in Niger. The French president will specify the final details of his nation's support on Sunday, but the focus is expected to be on equipment.The UN Security Council has unanimously adopted a resolution that welcomes the G5 Sahel deployment but does not grant it UN authorisation, and France was forced to drop a request for a special UN report on financing for the force.The UN peacekeeping mission is due to deploy its own rapid intervention force composed of Senegalese troops in Mopti, the same region the G5 Sahel force will be based.Sources in the French presidency told AFP it wants the Sahel force to be active on the ground by autumn, before looking for wider sources of funding by the end of the year or in early 2018.The question of funding is sensitive as Chad's leader Idriss Deby has said that for budgetary reasons his troops cannot serve simultaneously at such high numbers in the UN peacekeeping mission and also in the new force.Deby and Macron are due to meet on the margins of the Bamako summit, according the French presidency, as Chad's military is widely viewed as the strongest of the five Sahel nations.&nbsp;'Security traffic jam'&nbsp;African Union President Alpha Conde underlined on Wednesday that the continent must "take responsibility for the fight against terrorism," echoing the views of Macron's foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.However, cooperation remains key.The G5 Sahel force's top commander, Malian general Didier Dacko, said that at first each country's contingent would operate on its own soil, gradually becoming more focused on mutual borders.There would be "close collaboration with Barkhane forces and the UN mission," Dacko told AFP.Macron was keen on his last visit to Mali to promote economic development rather than military might, with hopes that improving the situation of young people would dim the allure of joining jihadist groups.Conflict in the area is also driven by land disputes, the lack of a functioning state in some areas and poor governance where it is operative, experts say.In a letter to the Security Council in April, International Crisis Group researchers warned the benefit of the G5 Sahel force was "unclear" in the context of so many military troops already present in the region.They said the new deployment "risks aggravating what amounts to a security traffic jam."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
