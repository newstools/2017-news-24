I know people who wake up early hours of the morning and check their phone and start respond to messages, is that ridiculous?"Daubermann said Stander alleged that the data was a puzzle that was easy to put together, but said it was not so simple. "He has created a conspiracy theory and has looked at facts that support that theory. That is as far as the State's case goes," he said.Chetty then ruled that the application brought by Daubermann was dismissed. Court then adjourned.It was the last sitting of this session, with the case set to resume on September 26 to 29, and then provisionally from October 16 to 20, subject to Daubermann's availability.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
