on Tuesday morning to account for some members of the Gupta family's
naturalisation during his tenure as home affairs minister. Along with him, his successor as minister of home affairs
Hlengiwe Mkhize, and home affairs director-general Mkuseli Apleni, have been
called to appear before the portfolio committee on home affairs. The Economic Freedom Fighters the week before last revealed
that Gigaba, waved the residential requirements for the applications of Ajay
Gupta, his wife Shivani, mother Angoori, and sons Kamal Kant Singhala and Surya
Kant Singhala, for naturalisation and granted it to them early. Gigaba said he did nothing wrong and Apleni last week sent a
letter to the portfolio committee outlining the process followed in the
naturalisation of the Gupta family members, concluding that everything was done
by the book. The letter, however, admitted that the naturalisation was
never tabled in Parliament. According to Democratic Alliance MP and spokesperson on home
affairs, Haniff Hoosen, failure to table the naturalisation in Parliament is a
breach of the law. Hoosen is also expected to ask Gigaba how the Guptas came to
be in possession of confidential information of some of the critics, including
the identification numbers and travel plans of former minister of finance
Trevor Manuel and EFF leader Julius Malema. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
