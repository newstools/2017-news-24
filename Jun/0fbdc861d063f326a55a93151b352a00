He described the suspects as a "criminal chain", whose deeds were "shameful"."To learn that they sold this handsome child for a pittance of N600 000 ($1 906) is most annoying and shameful. We will not spare them," Ezike was quoted as saying.A police official who was allegedly part of the gang was also being investigated.Reports indicated that child abduction was widespread in the west African country, with some being forced to carry out suicide bombings by the notorious extremist group Boko Haram. According to Human Rights Watch, Boko Haram fighters have abducted hundreds of children in the country's north. Boko Haram attacked Damasak in November 2014, took control of the town, and&nbsp;abducted children&nbsp;between ages 2 and 17 years.
