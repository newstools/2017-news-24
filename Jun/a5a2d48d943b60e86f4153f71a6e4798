Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga said on Friday no new cases of the deadly virus have been confirmed in the Likati zone for more than 21 days, the maximum incubation period. However, he says experimental vaccines to fight the virus have not yet arrived. Likati is some 1 400km from DRC's capital, Kinshasa. The World Health Organisation says three deaths have been blamed on the virus since it emerged May 11 in DRC's far north. Only two have been laboratory-confirmed as Ebola. WHO says this was the eighth outbreak in DRC since 1976. DRC has a long track record with the hemorrhagic fever. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
