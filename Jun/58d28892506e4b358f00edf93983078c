This is my very own blood. I am not okay - I am destroyed.&ldquo;How can one [allegedly] kill a child that you raised? You are supposed to love them.&rdquo;Peters was rumoured to have married Ruiters according to Muslim rites, but her father said he couldn&rsquo;t confirm this as he hadn&rsquo;t been invited.They had been in a relationship for about a year.&ldquo;He is a silent guy, someone who would pretend he&rsquo;s okay. He pretended to be a great person.&rdquo;His grandson was a loving child, Ruiters recalled fondly.&ldquo;Jeremiah always smiled when I held him. He was okay when I went there.&rdquo;Previous hospitalisationThree months ago, the toddler was hospitalised after he broke his arm.Ruiters claimed the Department of Social Services had visited the house once following the incident and questioned the family.They, however, &ldquo;did not act&rdquo;.&ldquo;They left it just like that. If they had done their work, I think Jeremiah could still have lived.&rdquo;Sihle Ngobese, spokesperson for MEC for Social Development Albert Fritz, refuted that contact had only been made once.&ldquo;Social workers held regular contact with the family, and conducted home visits after the child had been hospitalised on two previous occasions,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;However there was no evidence at that time of abuse from the family, and social workers can only act and intervene on evidence available to them.&rdquo;Ngobese condemned Jeremiah&rsquo;s murder as a &ldquo;cruel act&rdquo;.&ldquo;This matter once again raises the importance of the family as being the first line of defence for children, as government cannot be in every household all the time. We call on our partners, the South African Police Service and the National Prosecuting Authority, to put forward strong cases and secure convictions.&rdquo; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
