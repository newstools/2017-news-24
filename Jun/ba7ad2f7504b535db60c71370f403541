The electoral commission said the presence of the military at polling stations had caused confusion."The nation, the voters and even the observers were surprised... they felt that some voters were intimidated," Independent Electoral Commission spokesperson Tuoe Hantsi told reporters.The South African Development Community (SADC) regional bloc said the involvement of the army could be "misconstrued as military interference" and could "influence the conduct of the election."The vote was the third general election since 2012 in the country known as Africa's Switzerland where years of political friction, including a failed coup, have stymied attempts to fight dire poverty.Lesotho has a 22.7% HIV-Aids rate in adults and an economy dependent on South Africa, which surrounds it completely.The small kingdom was plunged into crisis in 2014 when soldiers attempted to oust ex-prime minister Thomas Thabane.Thabane fled to South Africa, where he spent two years, while the regional bloc SADC stepped in to end the crisis.
