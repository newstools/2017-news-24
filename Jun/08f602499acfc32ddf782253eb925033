Malinzi became head of the TFF in 2013 and is up for re-election in August. Both men pleaded not guilty to the charge and will re-appear in court on July 3. In a separate case, the president and vice-president of the Simba football club, one of the oldest and most successful in the country, were charged with money laundering.
