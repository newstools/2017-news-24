That means costs will not be insignificant - just as Zimbabwe wallows in cash shortages.Added ZBC: "The theme of the conference is, &lsquo;Our Oceans Our Future: Partnering for the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal no. 14"."Relevant" guest?Last week Mugabe was reported to have spent more time outside the country this year than in it.Independent press reports said by late May he&rsquo;d covered more than 145 000km and spent 250 hours in the air. The US will be the tenth country he has visited in 2017."The UN should only invite relevant guests to these conferences," observed government critic, Fadzayi Mahere on Twitter.Strong enough to stay in officeSouth Africa-based journalist, Peter Ndoro commented: "President #Mugabe off on another trip.
