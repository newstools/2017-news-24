He suggested that residents discuss names and make submission to their ward councillor.The municipal council had appointed the provincial geographical names committee to oversee the process. According to a list circulated by the municipality, the proposed street names include Twins, Jazz, and Super Sand.Bushbuckridge EFF whip Rhulani Qhibi said these lacked "commemorative &nbsp;resemblance to the late cadres of Bushbuckridge". He claimed there had been no consultations."This is not surprising because it is the nature in which our municipality operates to summon people to do as they please and not care about the feelings of the people they govern," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
