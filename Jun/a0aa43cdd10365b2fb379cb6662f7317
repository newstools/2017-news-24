Does that deserve some recompense? I think it does," he said."After tax I took 700 euros [$784.22] a month [from Samusocial]. There was and remains a justification for that when you look at all that was accomplished," he added.The row began after an opposition politician revealed that Samusocial was paying its managers more than $67 209 a year. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
