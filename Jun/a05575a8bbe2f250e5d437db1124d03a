The violence came as soldiers were trying to repel another group of Boko Haram insurgents who were trying to invade.Extremists fought with soldiers in Alidawari village and Jiddari Polo suburb, where homes were set on fire, said Police Commissioner Damian Chukwu. Nigerian forces killed three Boko Haram insurgents, he said, and one attacker was captured alive. He said 13 people, including four attackers, were killed.Boko Haram often uses diversionary tactics to draw security forces to one area so that the extremists can attack elsewhere.The attacks inside Maiduguri took place in various locations around the Chad Basin Development Authority headquarters just before 21:00, resident Alhaji Bashir said. The targets included a mosque, the research institute, an area inside the authority quarters and another area near a college, he said.Young members of a civilian defense group, who have come together to combat the Islamic extremists, saw one suicide bomber at the headquarters. "One of the youth vigilantes rushed to hold him, and the bomb went off and killed the suicide bomber and three other persons," Bashir said.In the attack opposite the college, a female suicide bomber entered a crowd of worshippers leaving prayers and detonated her explosives, he said.Dozens of injured people filled the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital on Thursday morning, said Abba Shehu, a private security worker."It is a horrible sight we have here," he said. "I could not count the number of injured casualties at the accident and emergency ward, most of them sitting on the floor as the place is crowded and no beds to properly admit them."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
