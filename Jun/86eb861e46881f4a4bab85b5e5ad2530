The Department of Water and Sanitation appeals to the public to report water leakages. This is to save water in the wake of a decrease in the water levels of various dams in the Free State. Leaks at residences, from the water meter to the house, should be fixed by residents as soon as they occur. Leaks that occur outside the household, before the meter and on main lines, should be reported to the local municipality or the department. The hotline number to report leakages is 0800-200-200. Furthermore, the department urges the community to continue using water sparingly and working with spheres of government to save water. According to the department, water levels have decreased to 84,4% from 84,5%. Level-three water restrictions are still being enforced in the greater Mangaung Metro Municipality.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
