In the light of his experience, of what he has done," said Claude Karerwa Ndanzako, spokesperson for the Burundian presidency, after Kafando and Nkurunziza met on Thursday."We believe and we hope that he will do better than his predecessors," Ndanzako said, warning Kafando against "leaning" towards the opposition or publishing "slanderous reports against Burundi".The relationship between Burundi and the UN worsened after the publication of a damning human rights report in September 2016 that accused security forces of abuses.At least 500 people have been killed and over 400 000 have fled the country since the crisis began.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
