This claim is therefore a complete fabrication."READ: ANC MPs should table own 'no confidence' motion in Zuma - stalwartsMhlauli said during Mthembu's interview, he informed the journalist that caucus discussed the upcoming motion of no confidence.This was apparently discussed in a meeting attended by the national chairperson, the secretary general, the deputy secretary general and treasurer general of the ANC."This caucus meeting was called as a consequence of some MPs expressing their views on the matter and for caucus could reach a conclusion on the matter."Mhlauli said in a meeting with ANC leadership and caucus was resolute that it would not vote for any motion proposed by the opposition that sought to remove President Jacob Zuma."The Sunday Times article is therefore not only disingenuous and mischievous but it is in fact also inaccurate."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
