The infamous late night reshuffle saw Pravin Gordhan axed as finance minister, along with his deputy Mcebisi Jonas, among others. At the time, an intelligence report was alleged to have sparked the reshuffle and Zuma s earlier request that Gordhan return from an investor roadshow abroad.&nbsp;ICYMI:&nbsp;Zuma misses deadline to supply reasons for Cabinet reshuffle DA&nbsp;The DA says President Jacob Zuma has missed his deadline to hand over his reasons and record of decision for his Cabinet reshuffle on March 31. Judge Bashier Vally made the ruling in Pretoria last Thursday, after listening to arguments. DA MP James Selfe said the deadline was at 16:00 on Thursday afternoon. Zuma filed an application for leave to appeal the decision of the North Gauteng High Court on Wednesday evening.&nbsp;ICYMI:&nbsp;Zuma wants to delay Cabinet reshuffle record DA&nbsp;The Democratic Alliance says President Jacob Zuma wants to delay the legal process after he filed an application for leave to appeal the decision of the North Gauteng High Court, ordering him to submit the record and reasons of the decision to reshuffle. &nbsp;Judge Bashier Vally made the ruling in Pretoria on Thursday, after listening to arguments. "The president is clearly hell-bent on keeping these reasons from the people of South Africa, and is using every possible court process to do so," spokesperson Mabine Seabe said. Seabe said this court application was to frustrate and delay the legal process to review Zuma's disastrous Cabinet reshuffle and the firing of Pravin Gordhan and Mcebisi Jonas.&nbsp; Jump to top
