WATCHOn August 28 2015, two children were removed from their parents &ndash; Juan-Pierre Le-Corr&eacute;, 31, and Nicole North, 27 (pictured). The kids are five and two years old.Wild Wild Guardians&rsquo; reason was that the children were being neglected and abused.The organisation arrived with the police, a doctor and a representative from another charity organisation called Hi Kids. Within an hour, the children were gone.Le-Corr&eacute; denies being involved in drug abuse. He said the older child had accidentally spilt a cup of tea on the younger one.&ldquo;The boy was taken to the pharmacy around the corner, given some treatment and we were advised that it was unnecessary to go to the hospital,&rdquo; he said.Nevertheless, the court placed both children with their maternal grandmother, Amelia Botha. On September 1 2015, social workers from the Springs Magistrates&rsquo; Court received complaints from Botha&rsquo;s neighbours that she had allegedly been manhandling and swearing at the two-year-old.Le-Corr&eacute; dismisses this as a lie.But on September 3, the children were removed from their grandmother&rsquo;s care and placed in the care of foster parents.Le-Corr&eacute; admits that North, who works as a packer at a nearby Spar, has a mental condition that forces her to see a psychologist once a week, but denies that the children were ever neglected.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my third job since the removal of my kids, because I have to attend court frequently,&rdquo; Le-Corr&eacute; said.&ldquo;Thinking about this angers me because babies are meant to bond families. These removals are dividing families,&rdquo; he said.Asked what he had to do to get his children back, Le-Corr&eacute; said the court told him to first get a proper place to live because the single room that he lived in with North and the children was too small.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
