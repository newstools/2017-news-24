In particular, it is the communities who are dependent on public transport for their mobility who suffer the most.&rdquo;He said lower income families spent on average up to 43% of their monthly income on transport costs and in some instances in Cape Town, costs could be as high as 60%&ldquo;Those who randomly destroy our public transport infrastructure when aggrieved are depriving law-abiding residents of their right to affordable, accessible and safe public transport. Our rail system is already crippled by the ongoing sabotage and violent attacks, and thousands of commuters have shifted to road-based public transport as a result,&rdquo; said Herron. &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
