However, due to the invalid nature of the contract, it would have to deviate from normal bidding processes.This was something Treasury was not prepared to do unless the Constitutional Court approved it.An inter-ministerial task team subsequently rejected the two-year deal, saying negotiations should start afresh only if and when Treasury gave its prior written approval for the deal's violations of procurement rules. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
