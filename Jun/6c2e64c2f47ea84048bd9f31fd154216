The European Union said the law is "likely to directly affect" its assistance, which relies on cooperation with NGOs.Amnesty International said the law is a "catastrophic blow" and could be a "death sentence" for human rights groups in the Mideast country. Similarly, Germany's Federal Government Human Rights Commissioner, B&auml;rbel Kofler, expressed his concern about the law.But Egypt defended the law, saying it was drafted and passed in accordance with constitutional provisions. The Foreign Ministry said the law "supports and empowers civil society."The legislation was put into effect just one week after Egyptian authorities arrested potential presidential candidate Khaled Ali on charges that he violated public decency. He has since been released on bail pending trial. Authorities have also blocked access to a string of websites critical of the government, including Qatar's Al-Jazeera Network, Mada Masr and Daily News Egypt.Al-Sisi is grappling with an insurgency by Islamic militants in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula, an economy struggling to keep up with demands and employment needs of Egypt's surging population, and a sustained campaign of violence against the country's Christian minority.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
