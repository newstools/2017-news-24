There they presented her with a memorandum dated June last year, and said they would not return to work unless Ndebele was removed from her post."I advised them that I cannot simply at the drop of a hat remove or relocate Ndebele without following due process and procedure as this would constitute an unfair labour practice."I undertook to investigate why the memorandum had not been dealt with...when they left, I presumed they would return to work."But they didn't and the disgruntled group at the mortuary grew in size.Msimango issued them with an ultimatum but this was ignored.She said by now the group was "loitering on the premises and becoming disruptive"."They were intimidating employees who were working...they were engaged in an illegal strike."'Effectively hamstrung'In the meantime, SAPS members continued to bring in bodies and, at the time of making the affidavit, there were 14 awaiting post mortems and it was expected that every day this would increase by about another seven.The other mortuaries were contacted but they said they had no capacity to take on extra work.Grieving families - some of whom require immediate post mortems for same-day burials in accordance with their religious beliefs - were being affected and police investigations were being hampered."We have been effectively hamstrung and we intend to take disciplinary action against those responsible," she said.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
