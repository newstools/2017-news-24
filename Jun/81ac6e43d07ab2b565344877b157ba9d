Speedy efforts should be made to address genuine grievances by forensic pathology officers, but any violence should be condemned and halted," he said.He said the department had obtained a court order in December 2016 to stop another, separate mortuary strike, and should do the same with the current strike."We cannot have a situation where bodies pile up in mortuaries, causing further anguish to bereaved families."Lengthy negotiationsOn Friday, five corpses that were stuck at the Diepkloof centre were released to their respective families after Health MEC Dr Gwen Ramokgopa intervened, the department said at the time.Ramokgopa had visited the facility after lengthy negotiations with the officers. The aim of her visit had been to intercede for the autopsies to be done before bodies could be released to their families, the department said in a statement."This was done with the interest of families that came from as far as KZN, Limpopo, and Lesotho who had already arranged for transportation of their loved ones to their respective homes for burial this weekend," he said.Forensic pathologists working at the facility were requested to conduct the autopsies on the five released bodies.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
