Several villages around Kaseghe are occupied by the Mai-Mai. There is not a single soldier in these villages," he said.The Mai-Mai is a "self-defence" militia comprising members of several different ethnic groups in the region. During the second civil war in the DRC (1998-2003), a number of these groups were armed by the ruling power to fight invading Ugandans and Rwandans - and several groups never disarmed.Kaseghe is located in the Lubero territory neighbouring Beni where a series of deadly clashes have taken place over the past year. Sixteen people were killed on Thursday near Beni in clashes between the army and a suspected Mai-Mai group - though its presumed spokesperson describes it as a national revolutionary movement opposed to the regime of President Joseph Kabila.Kabila has been in power since 2001 when he succeeded his father. He was elected president in 2006 and 2011 and his second mandate expired in December.But the 46-year-old leader has refused to step down fuelling a political crisis in the vast central African country. Elections are now supposed to be held by the end of this year.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
