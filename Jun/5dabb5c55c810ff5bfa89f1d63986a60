Unlike other nights, the crowds appeared to be growing smaller but they chanted demands for the release of Zefzafi.A solidarity rally was also held in the capital Rabat.Around 40 activists and key members of the grassroots Al-Hirak have been detained since May 26. Around 20 have been referred to the prosecution.The government said on Sunday, the final day of a three-day general strike, that "the doors to dialogue remain open", despite clashes at the weekend between demonstrators and security forces.Protesters in the Rif have rejected the mediation of local officials, accusing them of corruption, and branded the central authorities a "police state".With the apparent breakdown in trust, the Maroc Hebdo magazine pointed to parallels with major protests of 2011 when uprisings ripped through the Middle East and North Africa.The mainly ethnically Berber Rif region has long had a tense relationship with the central authorities in Rabat, and it was at the heart of the Arab Spring-inspired protests in Morocco in February 2011."It seems that only the king really has the means to calm the situation," said Maroc Hebdo, adding Moroccans were waiting to see "if he will intervene".King Mohamed VI relinquished some of his near-absolute control through constitutional reforms following the 2011 protests. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
