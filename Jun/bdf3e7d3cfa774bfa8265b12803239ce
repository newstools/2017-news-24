The vote in rural areas is now likely to be shared between the DC and its splinter, the Alliance of Democrats."'Difficult to choose'The mountainous country suffers high unemployment and a 22.7 percent H.I.V.-AIDS rate in adults, with an economy dependent on South Africa, which surrounds it completely."The people in power have let us down, as we have seen with the last government and the one before it," Tefo Mohale, an unemployed 27-year-old, told AFP."The next government is going to follow suit, it is difficult to choose who to trust."According to the electoral commission, 1.2 million people have registered to vote.Thabane was forced to flee to South Africa in 2014 after an attempted coup by the army."It was the most undignified thing that happened to me, to wear (just) my pants... and go through the fence with my wife, running away from the state house," Thabane told AFP on the campaign trail.At his final rally, Mosisili accused Thabane of escaping to seek foreign protection after "chowing through the public's money."Critics accuse the army of meddling in politics and favouring Mosisili.Lesotho is a constitutional monarchy ruled by King Letsie III, who has no formal power, and it has a mixed parliamentary system. Eighty lawmakers are voted in by constituents, while another 40 seats are distributed proportionally.Mosisili's DC party is forecast to join forces with the Lesotho Congress of Democracy (LCD) and the Popular Front for Democracy (PFD).Thabane's ABC party and the Alliance Democrats (AD) of Monyane Moleleki, a former police minister, are also in talks to form a possible coalition government.Reflecting frustration at the country's politics, voter turnout declined sharply to just 46 percent in 2015 from 66 percent in 2002.Voting opens at 0500 GMT and closes at 1500 GMT, with counting expected to take several days.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
