I shudder to think of the consequences if that vehicle had to be in a collision," he said.He urged commuters to steer clear of overloaded vehicles for their own and others' safety."Incidents like these do nothing for the reputation of the taxi industry, and so I also call on owners and associations to address this type of lawlessness."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
