Louw said the EFF repeatedly offered their 6% representation in the National Assembly to the African National Congress (ANC) to amend the Constitution.&nbsp;ANC MP Freddie Adams thanked Zuma for his "wisdom" in referring the bill to the house of traditional leaders.The Expropriation Bill allows the State to expropriate land for a public purpose or in the public interest and seeks to bring the expropriation in line with the Constitution.The law currently regulating expropriation dates back to the apartheid era.&nbsp;Earlier, during a discussion on the Extension of Security of Tenure Amendment Bill, minister of rural development and land reform Gugile Nkwinti said the EFF learned to hate from the National Party.&nbsp;"The NP was a very good teacher," he said, with a hint of irony in his voice. "The EFF is full of hate. You learned that from the NP." "You're cowards!" yelled EFF MP Nazier Paulsen.Follow News24 reporter Jan Gerber on Twitter for the latest updates:&nbsp;@gerbjan 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
