The leaked emails reveal how several women had the hots for the president&rsquo;s handsome son.Several raunchy emails, intended for Duduzane, were sent to President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s private email account in 2015 &ndash; the same year Duduzane married Shanice Stork at a lavish wedding at the five-star Zimbali Lodge in Ballito.We now know the Gupta family helped to pay for the nuptials and that their company chief executives were involved in arranging it.On March 3 2015, two months before his wedding, he received four emails from Cape Town-based former fashion editor and freelance stylist Malikah Hajee. The subject line of one of her emails is, &ldquo;Remember what you missing! (sic)&rdquo;When City Press called Hajee, she confirmed that she had received an email with questions from our reporter, but didn&rsquo;t wish to comment.Complicated love lifeAnother woman who sent risqu&eacute; pictures to the first son was Frenchwoman Nad&egrave;ge dos Reis, who sent him a number of selfies on October 30 and 31 2015 &ndash; five months after his wedding &ndash; which included one of her in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris.According to her Linkedin profile, Dos Reis comes from the French coastal city of Marseilles and studied business and environmental law. In another email with a subject line that reads, &ldquo;That makes u flight to paris? (sic)&rdquo;, she attaches a picture of herself in a skintight, low-slung pink minidress, and another of her shapely, lingerie-clad bottom, while lying on a bed.Emails and Facebook messages sent to Dos Reis also went unanswered this week. The emails provide a window into Zuma&rsquo;s complicated love life. One, from a family lawyer, details how his lawyers and those of the mother of his son, who was born in 2015, quibbled over till slips, credit card bills and &ldquo;start-up costs&rdquo; for the baby.It shows that the child&rsquo;s mother wanted R30 000 per month in maintenance for the baby, and also wanted Duduzane to pay his share of the costs for a night nurse, as well as antenatal classes.An email the lawyer sent to him in September 2015 said:&ldquo;Nanny must be included in monthly maintenance claims as referred to above and, if she has done any other work, such as household help, or will be doing so, this must be stated, as your client will then bear a portion of her cost for herself too.&rdquo;Baby items the mother had bought and attached invoices for were also listed, including a pram set, cot and cot linen, a breast pump, a bouncing chair and a baby gym. But some of the costs didn&rsquo;t sit too well with Duduzane&rsquo;s lawyer.&ldquo;A contribution to start-up nappies, wipes and basic medications of R2 000 (the chemist and other slips are not all for the child, and some appear to be post-birth),&rdquo; the lawyer wrote.&ldquo;A contribution to a rocking chair as the one bought was excessive: R1 000.&rdquo;The rocking chair the mother bought cost R3 689.IssueThe lawyer also took issue with the amount of maintenance asked for.&ldquo;Regrettably, your client&rsquo;s claim for R30 000 per month (which means that the child requires R60 000 per month) is absurd and cannot be accepted."On your client&rsquo;s own figures sent to us in July, the child&rsquo;s approximate costs were R37 011.79, and your client now asks my client to pay 50%. "On her own version, that would be some R18 500, and those costs were excessive...&rdquo;Before this letter was sent, Duduzane&rsquo;s lawyer had made an overture to pay her a lump sum instead of maintenance every month. AmaBhungane and Daily Maverick reported this week that Gupta lawyer Gert van der Merwe advised Duduzane, who paid the woman R3.5m.Her lawyer wrote:&ldquo;It is my instruction that an actuary has to be appointed, at your client&rsquo;s expense, to determine what the financial needs of the minor child will be until the age of minority, and to use his/her findings as a starting point to calculate the once-off lump sum payment (sic).&rdquo;Duduzane&rsquo;s lawyer responded: &ldquo;We can then look at my client&rsquo;s monthly maintenance contribution and the possibility of having this actuarially calculated to a lump sum payment (my client will make a lump sum offer and your client is welcome, at her expense, to employ an actuary to ascertain if it suffices).&rdquo;On Thursday morning, City Press approached Duduzane for comment on a list of questions about his personal life, via email and text message.The questions were also sent to Gupta family spokesperson Gary Naidoo to whom City Press had earlier spoken to by telephone. However, no responses were forthcoming.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
