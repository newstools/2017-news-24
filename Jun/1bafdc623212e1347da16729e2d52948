	     PE’s Finest Dance Company and The PE Opera House will present The Whirlwind: Dawid Stuurman at The Barn Theatre from tonight. In the dance piece, Dugulth “Junior” Ferreira of PE’s Finest follows the story of iconic Khoisan hero Dawid Stuurman who was born around 1773 in the Gamtoos River area. Stuurman found himself working for a farmer, Johannes Vermaak, but later abandoned his role as farm labourer, formed his own rebel group and fought back against the farmers and those who had stripped his people of their land.  He was sent to Robben Island without the benefit of a trial and escaped on numerous occasions. After his third escape, he was banished to Australia.  After six years in compulsory government employment, Stuurman was given permission to work for wages for himself. He died on February 22, 1830, in Sydney Australia at the General Hospital. The performance of The Whirlwind: Dawid Stuurman will take place from June 14 to 17 in The Barn Theatre at the PE Opera House. The show will start at 7pm from June 14 to 16, while shows on June 17 will take place at 2pm and 7pm. Tickets will be sold at the door at R50 per adult and R20 per student and pensioner.
