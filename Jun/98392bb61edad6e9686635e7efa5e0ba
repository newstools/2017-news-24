They clung to bits of the dinghy until it fell dark, then a boat arrived and they were rescued," IOM spokesperson Flavio Di Giacomo told AFP.The survivors were later transferred to the British military ship HMS Echo, which is currently operating in the Mediterranean as part of the EU's anti-trafficking Operation Sophia.They were among 550 people the HMS Echo disembarked in the Italian port of Brindisi on Friday, following an intense week of rescues at sea.With smugglers taking advantage of a spell of good weather and calm seas, more than 10 000 people were rescued from rickety boats off Libya since Sunday alone.Nearly 77 000 migrants have landed in Italy since January, up 15 percent on the same period in 2016.The latest deaths increase the toll of people dying attempting the crossing or missing, feared drowned, to nearly 2,100 since the beginning of 2017.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
