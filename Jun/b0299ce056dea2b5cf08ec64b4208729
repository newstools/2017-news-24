The unrest in Kasai began when a local tribal chieftain, known as the Kamwina Nsapu, who was rebelling against the authority of President Joseph Kabila's government, was killed during clashes with the security forces in August 2016.On Saturday, the UN urged Congolese authorities to pare back their military presence in the region "to prioritise dialogue". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
