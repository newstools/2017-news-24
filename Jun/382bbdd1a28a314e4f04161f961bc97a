It comes in the form of a chai-style brew to be launched next week at the house of the movement&rsquo;s origin in Johannesburg. The tea is named after Satyagraha House, which had specially commissioned it for visitors to the historical building.It is being created in partnership with local tea brand Yswarra using historical details about Gandhi&rsquo;s religious relationship with food and drinks to inform the flavours.Gandhi was once an ardent tea drinker, Yswarra founder Swaady Martin-Leke explains, but his passion for the drink quickly changed.&ldquo;One day one of his friends told him, &lsquo;Mr Gandhi, you cannot have this stimulating tea!&rsquo;&rdquo; Martin-Leke explains. Gandhi was a Jain, she says. Jainism&rsquo;s adherents are forbidden from having any sort of stimulant, &ldquo;so from that moment he stopped drinking tea&rdquo;.This little historical detail informed the whole development of the Satyagraha House tea. &ldquo;I had to develop a tea that wasn&rsquo;t a tea, but rather a herbal infusion. &ldquo;I created a drink whose main ingredient is verbena &ndash; a calming, soothing plant that we sourced at a beautiful farm in Malawi.&ldquo;Because Gandhi was Indian, I felt that we also needed some of that tradition in the tea, so we added some of the most significant Indian spices, such as cardamom and cinnamon.&rdquo;The Satyagraha House tea will debut next week, where it will be exclusively available to visitors to the historical site. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
