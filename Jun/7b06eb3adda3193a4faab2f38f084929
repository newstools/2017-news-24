Sibusiso Mthethwa, 36, was shot near the gate of Edendale Hospital on Friday evening, said spokesperson Sam Mkhwanazi. He died in hospital the following morning. Mthethwa, an intermediate life support paramedic, had been stationed at the nearby Imbali township base. Provincial health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo said he was shocked at the callousness of the attack. "It is concerning that human life has become cheap to a point where criminals appear not to even think twice before snuffing away people's lives."He said they had been robbed of a &ldquo;foot soldier&rdquo; who was committed to saving others. Dhlomo hoped the perpetrators would be tracked down as soon as possible. The paramedic leaves behind his wife and five children. He will be buried at Nquthu on Sunday.Also read:&nbsp;Under police escort, South African ambulances brave attacks 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
