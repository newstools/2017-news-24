Traut said that the suspect will appear in the Atlantis Magistrate&rsquo;s Court on two charges of murder once he is charged. The bodies of 23-year-old mother, Octavia de Bruin, and her two-year-old daughter, Cleo, were found on Tuesday in bushes in the area, with their heads buried in the sand. They were last seen over the weekend on their way to a hairdresser. &ldquo;We will fight crimes against women and children with all our resources and will pursue every avenue to ensure that criminals face their day in court,&rdquo; said Traut in a statement. Earlier, the Atlantis community was enraged by the double murder, and the lack of arrests by police, leading to plans for a march on Saturday. Their murders added to already heightened fears over the safety of women and children in South Africa, as many continue to senselessly lose their lives in brutal murders. Atlantis residents are no strangers to brutal murders. In April 2012, 18-year-old Marshay Louw, and her one-year-old daughter were found in bushes close to Extension 12, their bodies decomposing a few meters from home. To date, no arrests have been made in the case. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
