We reject this behaviour with all imaginable contempt."He said the opposition seems to have concluded that they have a monopoly on what constitutes a "conscientious vote."They have been insisting that ANC members of Parliament must 'vote with their conscience' to remove the president of the ANC who was elected by ANC MPs."To their arrogant selves, conscience belongs only to a vote that favours their childish ambitions. This is absolute nonsense and moral opportunism."We call on ANC members of Parliament to correctly apply themselves and vote with their consciences in defending the ANC and the political mandate that it gave to them by rejecting any attempt to win power through the backdoor outside of general elections. Whether this is by secret ballot or not, revolutionary consciousness and discipline must be observed."Nzuzu warned South Africans against the opposition's "double standards", which according to him pose a threat to our constitutional democracy."The point here is that people must disabuse themselves of calling for extra-parliamentary interventions if they are not prepared to live with consequences that do not favour their own biases." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
