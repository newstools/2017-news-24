You are a cleaner; you are a pathologist; you are in the same structure. That's what they did," Kopane said.READ: Forensic pathologists urged to return to work 'in the interest of justice' Skills transferShe said some pathologists resigned while others passed away, which reduced the number of pathologists in the public sector."Apparently these other lay people [unqualified people], they also started to do this job they are not trained to do like dissecting the bodies and everything," Kopane said."They learnt from the pathologists. Actually, that's how the skills were transferred so that's why later they felt they are competent, they can do the job, despite that they did not have the qualification to do so."Kopane confirmed that the unqualified staff conducted post-mortems without trained pathologist supervision.She questioned why it took the department 10 years to identify the crisis."How many people can come back and say, what if my autopsy was performed by one of these unqualified people? What if it was not genuine?" she said."[This] means people are in jail for the wrong reasons or the results that were given to us were wrong."On Thursday, News24 reported that Nehawu and Hospersa said that their members - untrained forensic staff - had been conducting post-mortems for well over 10 years.'Some of them are only employed as drivers; they are now cutting bodies'On Monday, Hospersa spokesperson Suzan Ntlatleng said some of their members only obtained matric."They were brought in to identify bodies. Later on, they were cleaning bodies. What is happening now is that they are forced to do the entire autopsy," Ntlatleng said."Some of them are only employed as drivers; they are now cutting bodies. We have cleaners who were surrounded by the bodies and, over the years, started to get an idea of what's happening, and started helping."Ntlatleng said staff members were allegedly forced to sign affidavits in which they lied that a trained pathologist had conducted the post-mortems.Wits University visiting associate law professor, James Grant, expressed concern that if the allegations were true, it might affect thousands of court cases."If you are talking about somebody who has the means, who has the big guns, they very often might call the pathologist [to testify], and [they] air the lack of qualifications," he said on Monday afternoon."It is the poor and the vulnerable who get the short end. They are the people who have to rely on the State in dealing with court cases; they wouldn't have&hellip; to call these things into question."South African law permits evidence in the form of post-mortem results from pathologists, which is usually never challenged, Grant said."Because of bad post-mortems, the State [might have] lost. Because of bad post-mortems, people [might have been] charged and convicted," she said.Wrongful convictionsGrant said prosecutors usually used post-mortems to decide whether or not to prosecute.He said if the allegations were true, an entire review of court cases for the past 10 years would have to be conducted to determine wrongful convictions.The national and provincial department of health did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday morning.The Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPSCA) has not responded to emails and telephone calls from News24 since Thursday.Kopane said she is in the process of finalising a letter to the Public Protector requesting a full investigation into the crisis.She said she will additionally write to the Human Rights Commission."We really have to go to the deeper thing of this," Kopane said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
