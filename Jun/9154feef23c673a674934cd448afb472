	     Mthatha - Two initiation school nurses have been hailed as
heroes after helping save lives during a fire in which two teenagers died, the
Eastern Cape Department of Health said on Sunday. Two initiates, aged 18 and 19, burnt to death and 23 others
were rushed to hospital after a fire broke out at the initiation school outside
Qumbu at about 06:00 on Sunday, said departmental spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo. The outcome of the fire could have been far worse had it not
been for the two initiation nurses, who were also hospitalised, Kupelo said.  “They saved many students. If it was not for them, a number
more initiates could have died.” Kupelo said the initiation school, located in the village of
Ntabasgogo, was erected in a traditional hut, made of grass. This type of hut is built with just a small opening through
which to exit, as it is traditional that when you leave the school, “you don’t
walk out, but instead kneel and crawl”. The two who died were last in the queue as escape through
the small opening after the fire broke out.  Thirteen of those injured were treated for burn wounds of
varying severity and were taken to hospital in Mthatha, while ten were treated
for smoke inhalation. Police and various other officials were busy at the scene
and would investigate the exact cause of the fire. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
