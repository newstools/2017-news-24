Cape Town - A South African-born man now living in Canada has set social media alight after a picture of him emerged where he calmly mowed his lawn while a huge tornado was spinning in the background.&nbsp;His wife told the BBC that Theunis Wessels was aware of the tornado which was about 2km from his house and "wasn't worried at all".&nbsp;On her Facebook account, Cecilia Wessels posted a picture of her husband mowing the grass with the words: "My beast mowing the lawn with a breeze in his hair."Cecilia was woken by her seemingly "upset" daughter, 9, who was concerned by the fact that her father was not running for cover from the raging tornado.&nbsp;After rushing out to see what her daughter was worried about, her husband told her that "everything is OK", according to BBC.&nbsp;Cecilia took a picture of her husband and sent it to her parents who are in South Africa. She told the Times Colonist that "I literally took the picture to show my mum and dad in South Africa, 'Look there's a tornado,' and now everyone is like, 'Why is your husband mowing the lawn?'"One Facebook user, who commented on a&nbsp;BuzzFeed&nbsp;article, said that although the tornado didn't pose much threat as it was moving away,&nbsp;Theunis "was in grave danger" from lightning. "One can tell when one is in danger from a very visible tornado like that, especially when it is clearly moving away. But at the same moment he was in grave danger from lightning while pushing the hunk of metal on the ground. That's way riskier (sic)."According to the BuzzFeed,&nbsp;the family moved to Canada from South Africa seven years ago, and that the adventurous Theunis has attended a seminar led by Tornado Hunters' Greg Johnson.&nbsp;Another Twitter user jokingly said: "Nothing stops a Canadian from mowing his lawn."News24 couldn't immediately reach the family for comment.&nbsp;Still amazed by this.
