Hammadi described it as a "noble gesture on their part".But in a mark of the distrust of the government in the region, the protesters' spokesman Tarek Haddad said they would not remove their camp outside the remote desert plant two hours' drive from the town of Tataouine until the deal had been honoured."The tents will remain in place until they start to implement the measures," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
