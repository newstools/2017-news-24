The ANC&rsquo;s discussion document on organisational renewal proposed that changing environmental conditions necessitated a comprehensive review of the party&rsquo;s organisational and structural design.It posed a number of questions, including,&ldquo;Can we safely say there is disintegration and weakening of the Alliance and its component parts? Is there lack of coherence within the historical alliance partners?&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
