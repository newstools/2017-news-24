It was an attempt to distract the organisation from mobilising, organising and uniting South African women, she said.AllegationsMatuba said she was not surprised that "malicious attackers" had pre-empted an order handed down by the Constitutional Court on Thursday, by predicting that Dlamini would be held liable.The court ordered that there be further investigations into whether Dlamini should be held personally liable for legal costs that the Black Sash and other parties had incurred in their bid for the court to exercise oversight over a new contract to pay social grants.All parties involved were instructed to meet and appoint a referee to probe allegations that Dlamini, her former director general Zane Dangor and Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza had made in affidavits.If they failed to resolve the matter with the assistance of the referee, the court would give directions.On March 17, the court ordered that the contract between Cash Paymaster Services and the SA Social Security Agency, which it had previously declared invalid, be extended for 12 months&sbquo; under stringent conditions.It ordered Dlamini to explain why she should not be held personally liable for the costs of the application.&nbsp; &nbsp;"Malicious attackers of Bathabile who wish for her to be found personally liable by ConCourt have no interest in Sassa and its beneficiaries who are at mostly black children and women," Matuba said.She said the attack on Dlamini would not deter the ANCWL from championing the socio-economic agenda of South Africa's women.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
