This is information we would have expected the PSC to make available to the committee, but was unfortunately not shared," Dr Khoza emphasised.&nbsp;The standard of reports from the Free State PSC, as compared to other provinces that the committee has visited recently, was unquestionably below par.&nbsp; The Committee reiterated its belief that the PSC has an important mandate and must always strive to be independent of the state in order to effectively deliver on its mandate.&nbsp; "The PSC must at all times strive to perform its work without fear, favour or prejudice," Khoza said. &nbsp; The committee will engage the Chairperson of the PSC in an effort to ensure the preservation of set standards across provinces. These efforts will go a long way to ensure transparency and promoting accountability in the public service. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
