In addition, we will include these posts in the mass hate speech complaint that AfriForum will soon lay with the police,&rdquo; says Guido Urlings, Campaign Officer at AfriForum. AfriForum will also consider the possibility of instituting civil litigation against the individuals responsible for these callous posts if the complaints with the SAHRC or police do not yield any results. AfriForum received screenshots of the following statements on social media: Mathandazo Wabo Lova (@JabulaniKhesa) Dear White People What&rsquo;s happening with #KnysnaFire is called #Vutha and only black people can save you from it, just bring the land back.
