He resigned from the CGE once his identity was revealed by the Huffington Post. The post was also removed.The Press Ombudsman Johan Retief ordered the Huffington Post to apologise to the public for publishing the ''racist and sexist'' blog, which he found also incited hate speech.An extract of Retief's findings reads, "I do not believe for one moment that such discriminatory ... opinions can be described as being in the public interest - especially given this country's history of its struggle for liberation. To disenfranchise a section of the population once again would indeed represent a huge step backwards - one that may have some serious unforeseen consequences."He also criticised the Huffington Post for publishing without having identified the author, saying this contributed to the erosion of public trust in the media.Pillay resigned and Media24 apologised for the furore.Ngoepe noted that Pillay's appeal was out of the permitted time to do so, but he condoned it, and would deal with objections to this during the appeal."I am of the view that she has demonstrated reasonable prospects of success before the Appeals Panel; the application should therefore be granted."Ngoepe noted that the ombud's ruling had aroused huge public interest around freedom of speech, and urged that a copy of his decision to grant leave to appeal be sent to all the original complainants which includes Dr Christopher McCreanor and Mr Shean King, so that they can submit heads of argument or join the appeal proceedings should they wish to do so.The SA National Editors Forum also applied to be admitted as amicus curiae. The parties involved could respond and say whether they should be admitted, and this would be decided at the appeal. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
