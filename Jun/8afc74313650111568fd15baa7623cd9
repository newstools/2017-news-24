That really showed me the historical impact of this disaster," he said.In total the Western Cape saw 17 000 fires for the 2016/17 fire season, resulting in 142 fatalities, Deiner said.Of the 17 000 fires, 2000 were reported in informal settlements affecting 5900 people.ANC opposition MPLs were noticeably absent from the meeting. The Western Cape is governed by the DA.ANC spokesperson Cobus Grobler told News24 that the MPLs excused themselves due to personal family reasons.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
