Hamas seized Gaza in 2007.The power plant stopped operating in April after Hamas could no longer afford to buy heavily taxed fuel from Abbas' West Bank-based government. Gazans were left with four hours of electricity a day.Abbas also asked Israel to reduce the electricity it sends to Gaza, covering about one-third of the territory's needs. This electricity, paid for by the Abbas government, has been reduced by one-fourth since Monday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
