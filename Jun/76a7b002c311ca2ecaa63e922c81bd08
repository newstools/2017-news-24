Zimbabweans are smart enough to sift through all those choices and come up with the right decision," said Moyo. &nbsp;"Now is the right time, the country is not in a good place and it needs a change in approach, a change in leadership, a change in how to deal with cohesion of our people, build peace and to mobilise the energies of Zimbabweans to solve our issues collectively and it&rsquo;s a completely different style of leadership tool that which we have got at the moment," added Moyo.However, political analyst Joy Mabenge, said while Moyo had the right to make his independent decision, his chances of winning the election were minimal adding that the route he had taken undermined the project to democratise the country."(Former finance minister) Simba Makoni did it in 2013 when he contested as an independent candidate and we all know that he denied Morgan Tsvangirai the presidency. Mugabe could have been history by now," said Mabenge. Makoni won 8% of the vote, forcing Mugabe and Tsvangirai to face off in a second round of voting. However, Tsvangirai pulled out of presidential run-off vote at the last minute claiming that his supporters had been victims of politically-motivated violence.Nkosana Moyo (Frank Chikowore, News24)Mugabe went on to claim victory in the boycotted election but later formed a unity government with Tsvangirai following pressure from the Southern African Development Community and the African Union.Moyo had earlier told a news conference that he did not need any financial support to campaign for the presidency in the 2018 elections. "I have the money.&nbsp; And why should the opposition be sponsored? We have the resources, we are the people and it does not require money to engage voters in".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
