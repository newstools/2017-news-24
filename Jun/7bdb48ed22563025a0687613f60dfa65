Kavota, however, warned that a new rebel coalition has formed outside Beni after armed men on June 11 attacked the city's central Kangbayi prison, killing at least 11 and freeing 900 prisoners.The new coalition, which Kavota called the National Revolutionaries Movement, is likely composed of rebels from the Mai Mai, Allied Democratic Forces, former M23 members and others who escaped prison.Kavota said the new coalition may have external political and military support, given the logistics of the attacks, and he called on the government and military to quickly dismantle the group.Kavota, whose organisation tracks civilian deaths in the region, also called on the military to increase protection of civilians and public places.Eastern DRC is home to multiple armed groups that compete for control of the region's vast mineral resources. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
