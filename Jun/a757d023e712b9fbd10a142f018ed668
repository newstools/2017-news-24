The board was disbanded in May this year.The judgment in the above case had determined that the minister did not possess the necessary legislative powers to extend the term of office of board members beyond the maximum prescribed period as per the National Water Services Act (Act 108 of 1997).&ldquo;That case&rsquo;s judgment has bearing on the current term of office of the board of Umgeni Water, whose term expires on 30 June 2017, following a four year extension previously granted from July 1, 2013," the department explained.The minister has since informed the Umgeni Water board that she will not be extending its term further and that a process to appoint a new board will commence as a matter of urgency.Mokonyane has also been briefed on serious allegations that have been made against Gamede, various executives and members of the board."I have initiated a forensic investigation into the serious allegations of financial mismanagement, tender irregularities and manipulation of recruitment processes made at Umgeni Water and will await the outcomes of this investigation and will be informed by its conclusions on what actions ought to be taken,&rdquo; she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
