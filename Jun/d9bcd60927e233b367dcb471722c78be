The State requested more time to gather statements. However, an irate Magistrate Mahomed Motala cautioned that it would be the final postponement. "This has been happening since March and there is public interest in this matter. We need to get some closure." The duo had their bail extended to July 28 when they will appear again. They face charges of defeating the ends of justice and fraud. During their appearance, Mbambo once again kept her face covered while Mbokazi wore a formal red shirt. On Friday, March 10, the duo allegedly staged the hijacking of Mbambo's white Toyota Yaris from the Game City Centre with her baby still inside. A massive search was conducted, and a reward of R250 000 was offered for any information leading to her safe return. She was found unhurt on the morning of Sunday, March 12. The two were arrested when their stories did not match. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
