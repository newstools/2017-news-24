We even have people who are interested in joining us within the ranks of the ruling party. Therefore, we're going to play a significant role in influencing policy decision that would be beneficial to the working poor," said Beddowes.&nbsp;Opposition parties in Zimbabwe were currently working towards efforts to forge a unified alliance in next year's polls, with two deals having been signed&nbsp;in April between the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Morgan Tsvangirai and Joice Mujuru of the National People's Party (NPP).&nbsp;This was seen as an embryonic attempt to forge an alternative to President Robert Mugabe's rule, which began with independence from Britain in 1980.Soon after, &nbsp;Tsvangirai signed another pact to re-unite with the MDC-N, which split away in 2005, and was led by the Welshman Ncube.'Productive capitalism'&nbsp;The MDC has in recent years been weakened by repeated splits, and was badly fractured by Tsvangirai's troubled term as Mugabe's prime minister in a coalition government from 2009 until 2013.Taking a swipe at the fragmented opposition parties,&nbsp;Beddowes said that they did not have a coherent ideology and, as a result, they were not going to be able to represent the aspirations of the working poor.&nbsp;He said that his party aimed at advocating for "productive capitalism" which would see the country's wealth being returned to the masses.&nbsp;Beddowes said the ZPC wanted to build a national democratic economy based on "the self-activity of the working-people and the restoration of production"."The other political parties in the country do not have a coherent ideology. For now we are going to encourage productive capitalism and take the economy to the people. We want every district, city to have a plan on how to redistribute wealth to our people," he said.The ZPC was currently being led by its general secretary Nicholas Mabhena. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
