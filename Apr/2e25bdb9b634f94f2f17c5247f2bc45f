Therefore the initial referral was supplemented on 22 March 2017 to include reference to a series of comments [made] publicly and on social media that have... exacerbated and amplified the original tweet." &nbsp;Maimane said Zille has allegedly violated the party&rsquo;s federal constitution by acting in a manner which has brought the party into disrepute.1) Inundated with media calls but have heard nothing formally from the DA yet. 2) I cannot issue a press statement through Premier's office.Whatever I hear from the DA I have only one comment: I will abide by due and fair process of SA and DA constitution and the rule of law.&mdash; Helen Zille (@helenzille) April 2, 2017Whatever I hear from the DA I have only one comment: I will abide by due and fair process of SA and DA constitution and the rule of law.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
