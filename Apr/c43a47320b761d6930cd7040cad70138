In an interview during a visit to Algiers in February, the 39-year-old former economy minister said French actions in Algeria, which achieved independence in 1962 after eight years of war, were "genuinely barbaric". Macron, who is favourite to beat far right leader Marine Le Pen in next month's presidential run-off vote, has since sought to soothe tensions caused by his remarks. Algerian Foreign Minister Ramtane Lamamra told reporters that Macron "is our friend... he's a friend of Algeria and that's the truth".Macron, who is looking to become France's youngest ever head of state, beat Le Pen during Sunday's first round of voting. A run-off between the two takes place on May 7. Le Pen last month told France's BMFTV news channel that colonisation had done "a great deal" for Algeria. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
