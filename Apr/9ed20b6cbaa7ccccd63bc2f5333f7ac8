An enquiry has been opened into the death.The USN insists that the death of Mala Bagale, a third-year Sociology student, was a result of having been hit by a police teargas cannister.A total of 109 people were injured in the melee, 88 protesters and 21 police.Sambo said another meeting, with Prime Minister Brigi Rafini, would take place "to find adequate solution to the students' demands".The students are calling for better living and studying conditions and the payment of grants."We have promised the president a spirit of appeasement," said Sambo, adding that the students told that those still detained following Monday's violence would be released "in the coming days".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
