He handed himself to police in June and was granted bail of R100 000 on June 14.His sister, Marli, 18, survived the attack, but sustained serious brain injuries and has amnesia.On April 12, Van Breda and the NDPP filed an urgent application at the Constitutional Court to appeal the Western Cape High Court's ruling allowing Media24 permission to broadcast the trial.Expert witnessesThe Constitutional Court dismissed the application on April 13.Van Niekerk said livestreaming the entire trial could scare off witnesses."It is widely accepted that that the thought of having to appear on television may intimidate and inhibit witnesses. In particular, the knowledge that their evidence will be recorded and broadcast may prevent witnesses for the prosecution, including experts, from making concessions favourable to the accused under cross-examination, which they would otherwise have been prepared to make had the proceedings not been broadcast."Some expert witnesses had indicated they would feel uncomfortable testifying should the trial be broadcast, she said.On March 24, the Western Cape High Court heard the application to record and broadcast the trial.On March 27, the day the trial was due to start, Judge Siraj Desai granted Media24 permission to install two cameras to record and or broadcast the proceedings, subject to certain guidelines.Van Niekerk said when the matter sat at 14:15 that day, both Van Breda and the State indicated they intended appealing the order. Desai postponed the trial to April 24.Van Breda was not asked to plead.* News24 is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Media24, a Naspers company24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
