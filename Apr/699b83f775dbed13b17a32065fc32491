	     Mogadishu - A court in Somalia's breakaway northern territory of Somaliland has sentenced a journalist to two years in prison after he was arrested for meeting Somalia's new president. Abdimalik Muse Oldon was charged with engaging in anti-national activities, spreading "false" news and disturbing public order. Oldon, an online journalist, was arrested upon his arrival at the Hargeisa airport after he met Somalia's new President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed in February. Oldon was sentenced on Saturday at a regional court in Hargeisa, Somaliland's capital. Somali media organisations have long said Somalia's old penal code written in 1960 is designed to silence journalists and curtail freedom of expression. Oldon's family told reporters they would appeal the verdict. Somaliland broke away from Somalia in 1991. No country so far has recognised it as independent. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
