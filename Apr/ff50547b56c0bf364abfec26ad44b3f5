The government this week said negotiations have "gone quite far" but face challenges. It refused to give details, citing security reasons.The failure of Nigeria's former government to free the girls sparked a global Bring Back Our Girls movement.The schoolgirls from Chibok village are among thousands of people abducted by the Nigeria-based Boko Haram as it continues to threaten parts of the northeast and has spread into neighbouring countries.Buhari late last year announced that the extremist group had been "crushed," but it continues to carry out deadly suicide bombings, often strapping them to young women.On Wednesday, Nigerian security officials said they had thwarted plans by Islamic State group-linked Boko Haram members to attack the embassies of the United States and Britain, along with "other Western interests" in the capital.Nigeria's military in the past year has rescued thousands of Boko Haram captives while liberating towns and villages from the group's control, but many have been detained as possible Boko Haram suspects.Boko Haram's seven-year Islamic uprising has killed more than 20 000 people and driven 2.6 million from their homes, with millions facing starvation because of the disruption in markets and agriculture.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
