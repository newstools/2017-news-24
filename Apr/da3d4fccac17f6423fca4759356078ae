Their members hoped the prosecution of the pastor might spur change in a church that has resisted it."I think there's just a lack of evidence all the way around," defence lawyer Chris Ferro said. "This is a grieving grandfather, not a criminal."Ella Foster likely suffered from severely laboured breathing and a temperature of about 40&deg;C on the day she died, police said in charging documents, citing a forensic pathologist. She almost certainly would have survived had she been given antibiotics, the pathologist said.The girl's parents, Jonathan and Grace Foster, summoned the elder Foster to their home while she was dying, and he anointed her head with oil. Police called after she died, found her body fully dressed, covered with a blanket.Reverend Foster, 72, told police he has never been to a doctor.The girl's parents are charged with involuntary manslaughter and await trial. They have relinquished custody of their six other children.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
