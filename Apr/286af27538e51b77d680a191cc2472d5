Ngoako Ramatlhodi not resigning, yet Meanwhile, former public service and administration minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi is not resigning, yet. The former minister told News24 on Thursday that he did not know if he would stay or go. “I need time to reflect before making a decision. Right now, I’m relaxing and playing my golf,” he said. He did not know how long he would reflect, he said, but it would not be “for a while”.  Ramatlhodi said he would also need to reflect on whether to attend the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma debate, in the National Assembly on Tuesday, April 18. The resignations of both Jonas and Peters were effective from March 31. News24 understands that former tourism minister Derek Hanekom, who was also fired, is staying in Parliament.  Mthembu wished all the axed ministers well following their resignations. They had served with “absolute distinction”, he said.
