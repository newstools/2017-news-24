Mbeki asked.Mbeki said the Constitutional Court, in the March 31, 2016 judgment on the Nkandla matter, defined the role of MPs."It stated, correctly, that our MPs serve in Parliament as representatives of the people. They do not serve in Parliament as representatives of political parties, even as they are members of these parties."He said all MPs of all parties served as members because they were elected by the people of South Africa and were therefore accountable to this electorate &ndash; the people."There is absolutely no MP who sits in Parliament by virtue of being elected by the political party to which they might belong, including those who subsequently get elected by Parliament to serve as Head of State and government."This boiled down to questions the MPs should ask themselves."Do I serve in Parliament to promote the interests of my political party; or, do I serve in Parliament to promote the interests of the people; and, is it possible that there might be particular circumstances, and particular issues, when I consider that the interests of the party and those of the people coincide, and what actions should I take in this context?"It may be that the current political controversy has, at last, imposed on our country the opportunity and obligation the better to define the Constitutional and moral relationship between the people and their elected representatives."The motion follows President Jacob Zuma's controversial Cabinet reshuffle, which saw Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas being axed, among others.This led to a downgrade to so-called 'junk status' by ratings agencies Fitch, and Standard and Poor's, along with nationwide protests against Zuma. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
