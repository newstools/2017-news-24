Instead, he said the ride on the train was "absolutely wonderful".His protectors repeatedly told journalists, "no, no, no. There&rsquo;s no questions here. Let&rsquo;s move them", as Zuma laughed as he made his way off the train.After second attempts to try and get a comment from him, reporters were again told that "the president will not be answering any questions, now please move. Give the president some space".WATCH: Pres.
