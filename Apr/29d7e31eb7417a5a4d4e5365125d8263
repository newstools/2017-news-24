They contested the elections in 2014 and were defeated, but now they are trying to get the country through the back door."He said the anti-Zuma marchers had left them with no choice but to defend the country "from those who are trying to destroy it".The protests&nbsp;and marches have been&nbsp;sparked by the president&rsquo;s recent Cabinet reshuffle.Super Zuma said it was up to the president to recall ministers."People are appointed by the president, after consultations with the ANC, to become ministers. Indeed it is his priority to recall them," he said.Since 1994, there has&nbsp;never been a problem with Cabinet reshuffling, even during the times of Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki, said Zuma."Why this time?" he asked."People are deployed to be ministers, but they must expect that there&rsquo;ll be a time where the president wants to deploy someone else in their roles," he added.Provincial ANCYL secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo earlier said there would&nbsp;be marches to defend President Zuma across the province, but that the main march would be in Durban on Friday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
