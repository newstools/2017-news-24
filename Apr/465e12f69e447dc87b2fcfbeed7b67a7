The students have apparently been unable to register for 2017 because they failed or do not have money to continue.Staff working in the section were told not to come to work. On Saturday, the university said it would still notify them when they could return.Previously, Moholola explained that on March 29, about 73% of all cases that were handled by the readmission appeals committee were successful.There had been 645 total appeals received, 473 successful appeals, 157 unsuccessful appeals which would all be reviewed, and 11 still pending.On March 22, about 89% of the appeals handled by the financial aid appeals committee were successful (1 312 total appeals, 1 173 successful, 80 unsuccessful, and 59 pending).He said UCT&rsquo;s executive would help as many academically and financially eligible students as possible."However, it is an inevitable reality that there might still be a few cases of legitimate exclusion due to valid reasons."The sit-in organisers are collectively known as the Shackville TRC, a group which evolved from the Fees Must Fall and Rhodes Must Fall movements.Earlier protests led to the removal of a statue of Cecil John Rhodes at the university, a fee freeze for 2016, and conditional fee increases for 2017. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
