"You have sacrificed everything we stood for on an altar of corruption, greed and more greed..."Mr President, this country is not for sale and a people united will never be defeated."Hogan dismissed the last-minute cancellation of her late husband's state memorial as a sign of a terrified leadership.&nbsp; "They are so fearful of even his voice that they saw fit to cancel his commemoration because they were afraid it was going to become&hellip;" she declared before being drowned out by a crowd calling for Zuma to go.The memorial, was originally to be held jointly by the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation and the SA Communist Party, however following the cancellation of a state memorial, the Gauteng ANC also joined in on the commemoration ceremony.Hogan, herself a stalwart of the anti-apartheid struggle as well as a former minister of health and of public enterprises, earlier spoke emotionally on a more personal note about her relationship with Kathrada."In all the pain I have been suffering and all the grief I feel, I just say thank you, thank you, for all those wonderful years with you."Kathrada died on Tuesday morning, and his funeral service was held at West Park cemetery in Johannesburg on Wednesday.Zuma was asked by Kathrada&rsquo;s family not to attend the funeral.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
