I also made him take off his shirt to inspect if he had any other injuries. I did not see any other injuries and made note of the eye before I transported him," he said.Bosch said Siyoni had been warned of his rights by investigating officer Captain Kanna Swanepoel and had, of his own volition, offered to make the calls to Panayiotou to show them the role Panayiotou had played in organising his wife&rsquo;s murder.Bosch said Swanepoel had sought advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions relating to the legality of making the calls and had been given the go-ahead.He said that recordings of the calls had been made and that, on April 29, Panayiotou had requested a meeting with Siyoni, which had led to the meeting and subsequent recording of Panayiotou and Siyoni at the Engen garage.Missing pocketbooksBosch said he had observed the meeting taking place from&nbsp;a Steers, although he could not see or hear what was taking place inside the vehicle at the time.He told the court that afterwards the video footage had been reviewed and that, subsequently, Panayiotou had been arrested at his parent&rsquo;s home in Uitenhage.Under cross-examination, Price again raised the issue of missing pocketbooks, as Bosch&rsquo;s pocket book had apparently been stolen last year.Price also questioned Bosch on why, if they had recorded the calls, they had not recorded Siyoni being warned.He also pointed out that, while Siyoni was at the organised crime offices for more than 5 hours on April 28, there were just over 30 minutes of recordings.Price asked Bosch what had been discussed that had not been recorded."Did you ask him about the case," he asked.Bosch said they had discussed a number of things, including who else was involved in the case, but when asked if he had made any notes, he said he did not but did not know if anyone else did.Price countered by saying that, to date, no notes aside from the recordings on the time in question, had been presented.Price also challenged Bosch on why they had not agreed to Panayiotou&rsquo;s request to meet Siyoni at an OK Grocer.Bosch said if they had done that they would not have been able to record the conversation."Precisely," said Price.The case continues on Monday at 09:00.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
