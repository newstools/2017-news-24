An inquiry has been opened.National police spokesperson Adily Toro told reporters that the three officers were arrested over another incident involving a protester.They had "broken the laws and the rules of the republic" and "will answer for their acts before competent courts", Toro said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
