We will also embarrass Mbete and her partisan rulings in relation to our [EFF's] deputy president's recent remarks," Ndlozi said.The EFF spokesperson said the party had repeatedly written to the Speaker asking her to refer Zuma to a disciplinary committee and to initiate impeachment proceedings against him, without success."She is biased and only protects Zuma. This is why the EFF has been calling for her removal from the beginning of the fifth democratic Parliament. Her decision to charge the DP of EFF is legally invalid and it is tainted with bias based improper political motives."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
