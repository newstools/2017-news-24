Motshekga would receive the full report at the end of the year.Mhlanga stressed that CAPS was based on the principles of social transformation, equal educational opportunities, and ensuring the ills of apartheid were addressed.DA MP Gavin Davies welcomed Motshekga's statement on Wednesday, and claimed it was a clear sign that the minister disagreed with Dlamini-Zuma."[Motshekga's statement] is a polite way of saying that Dlamini-Zuma was talking rubbish," he said on Wednesday."If learners believe that the ANC is corrupt, it is not because of an anti-ANC propaganda campaign being waged in public schools. It is because evidence of ANC corruption is all around us."'Kids taught at schools that ANC is corrupt'On Thursday, Dlamini-Zuma raised concerns over what she termed a negative narrative against the governing party, saying it was perpetuated at schools and universities."They [kids] are actually taught against the ANC," Dlamini-Zuma said in Zamdela in the Free State."It&rsquo;s not surprising that kids will think the ANC is corrupt&sbquo; [or that the] ANC is useless, because this is what they are fed at school."She alleged that some universities, such as the University of the Witwatersrand, refused to allow their students to call South Africa a democracy.She claimed most schools would only say there is democracy and freedom in South Africa once another party took over.ANC members needed to constantly be aware of the balance of power, and could not allow a leadership vacuum to form in the party and in government."We must be honest when we analyse what's going on. We can't not admit that the organisation is weak at this point in time," she said.Once we are weak and once we are divided, we cannot mobilise and unite society, she added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
