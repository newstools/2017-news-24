The boy is believed to have been bitten by a white shark while surfing at popular surf spot Keurbooms, National Sea Rescue Institute spokesperson Craig Lambinon said in a statement. The boy turned to catch a wave when he saw a fin approaching him when he felt a bump on his right calf where he was bitten, Lambinon said. The boy was taken to a nearby hospital where he received sutures. He will be kept in hospital overnight as a normal precaution. Craig said investigations are currently underway to determine the species and size of the shark. Initial indications lean towards the bite being made by a White Shark of approximately two metres length. News24 on Friday reported that a large amount of white sharks was spotted in the Plettenberg Bay area.
