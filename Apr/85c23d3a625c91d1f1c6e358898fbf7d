He said it is vital that DRC's government take "meaningful steps, which to date have been lacking," to investigate.There was no immediate comment from Congolese authorities, who have promised to look into the killings of the two UN investigators and their interpreter and protect civilians from further violence.Hundreds of civilians have been killed and hundreds of thousands have been displaced in the region since government troops killed the leader of the Kamwina Nsapu militia in August, according to the UN.Wednesday's statement also blames militia members for some of the recent violence, including attacks on churches and government buildings, and it said the militia has been accused of recruiting hundreds of children as fighters.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
