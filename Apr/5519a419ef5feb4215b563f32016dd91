Mbeki said the MPs must put the country before the party.However Makwetla said if the motion was sponsored by the ANC then it "would make perfect sense for an ANC member to vote for it"."If we take an approach that suggests that we are now looking for solutions to what is happening inside the ANC from elsewhere, including opposition political parties, to correct what is wrong with the ANC, we will be making a mistake," Makwetla said.ANC 'divided right at the top'Makwetla's sentiments were also supported by another ANC MP, Jerome Maake, who is also a member of the MK national council's steering committee."How do you vote together with those people who openly say they want to destroy the ANC?" Maake asked.The MK national council, formed in 2016, has called for an urgent national consultative conference (NCC) to resolve the crisis gripping the ANC.Nyanda said the present political situation had left the ANC "divided right at the top"."There is this motion of no confidence proposed and there are marches calling for the president to step down," Nyanda said.They want the party's policy conference to be held on a date after the consultative conference.The ANC agreed to an NCC, but said two days of the policy conference must be set aside for the conference. The council made up of former MK commissars and stalwarts, however, wants the two separated. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
