He said he was not interested in stolen goods, and started walking back towards his house.Mbele grabbed Liwane's firearm, then stabbed him in the back and fled with the gun.&ldquo;He asked the court to be lenient, but no evidence was presented to justify and deviation,&rdquo; she continued.Liwane managed to get himself to a police station to get help and to report his stolen firearm. He survived the attack.Prosecutor Christopher Burke argued that Mbele's sentence should not be reduced because the firearm he stole was never recovered and still posed a danger to society.Holderness said the court had already deviated from the prescribed sentence of 15 years in view of the one year and three months he spent in custody before being convicted, and because of his plea that he needed to support his two children.He had a previous conviction, and in this case had attacked a person who had been giving him odd jobs. He had also not played open cards with the court regarding the firearm's whereabouts.Both judges agreed that the appeal be dismissed.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
