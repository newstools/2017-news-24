The recent violence in once-calm Central Kasai province has included the killing of an American and a Swedish investigator for the UN last month, alarming the international community. UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned on Wednesday that if DRC's government doesn't investigate the violence effectively, he'll urge that the International Criminal Court or another outside entity do it. The new UN statement said Congolese soldiers reportedly dug the 17 newly discovered mass graves after fighting with suspected militia members in late March and killing at least 74 people, including 30 children. Congolese soldiers also reportedly killed at least 40 people, including 11 children, in the capital of Central Kasai province, Kananga, late last month while going door-to-door looking for militia members, the UN said. The soldiers also reportedly buried an "unknown number of bodies" in a mass grave there. In addition, at least two women and three girls reportedly were raped by soldiers, the statement said. In a separate area of Kananga, the UN investigators were told that Congolese police had fatally trampled a one-month-old baby while searching a house. "The discovery of yet more mass graves and the reports of continued violations and abuses highlight the horror that has been unfolding in the Kasais over the last nine months," Zeid said. He said it is vital that DRC's government take "meaningful steps, which to date have been lacking," to investigate. There was no immediate comment from Congolese authorities, who have promised to look into the killings of the two UN investigators and their interpreter and protect civilians from further violence. Hundreds of civilians have been killed and hundreds of thousands have been displaced in the region since government troops killed the leader of the Kamwina Nsapu militia in August, according to the UN. Wednesday's statement also blames militia members for some of the recent violence, including attacks on churches and government buildings, and it said the militia has been accused of recruiting hundreds of children as fighters. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
