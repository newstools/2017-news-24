These checks included an examination of the documents made available by the judiciary during the conclusion of the investigation," Marcegaglia said.She said the company was "cooperating fully" with the authorities.Both companies have repeatedly maintained that they acquired the rights to the lucrative block in line with Nigerian law.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
