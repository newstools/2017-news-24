The prayer was to ask God to help us fight drugs in the community of KwaDabeka and Clermont. The rate is getting higher, leading to a rise in crime in the community. These drug addicts steal from the poor, rape children, the elderly and women and some of them even kill for their next fix. The organisation started with Sunday school members in 2002, but grew over the years after realising that most of our community lives in poor conditions. We feed about 126 children and help more than 1 000 people, including children and adults. The prayer was attended by KwaDabeka and Wyebank Ward 19 councillor Mvubu, Department of Health spokesperson Sister Shozi, Casipo Project spokesperson Cele, Department of Social Development spokesperson Mthimkhulu, Ikatsi NGO founder Nozipho Cele, SAPS spokesperson Mbatha and guest speaker from the Mayor s office, Nompumelelo Ntshangase. Our focus is to feed the children because many go to sleep without supper. We decided they must come to our office after school so we can give them something to eat and help them with their homework. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
