Cape Town - Former Hawks boss Berning Ntlemeza reported for duty on Monday morning, in defiance of a high court order setting aside his appointment, and then signed out an official vehicle. Police Minister Fikile Mbalula said he would not leave the Hawks premises until Ntlemeza returned his cellphone and the car he was "roaming around the streets of Pretoria with".This prompted South Africa's Twitterati to join the search. Here are some of the funniest tweets from the Twitter detectives.You're fired but you still coming to work...pay day uthi kuzoba njani?#ntlemeza pic.twitter.com/s3Kky8AfKmWhen minister Fikile Mbalula gets the news that #ntlemeza has Mantashed, only coming to work next week Monday, he be like.... pic.twitter.com/veazXeAhDy&mdash; Mweli Masilela (@mwelimasilela) April 18, 2017When minister Fikile Mbalula gets the news that #ntlemeza has Mantashed, only coming to work next week Monday, he be like.... pic.twitter.com/veazXeAhDyWhen #Ntlemeza tried to report for duty. pic.twitter.com/KbbDJmOVtV&mdash; BlackExcellence (@TshepoMongale) April 18, 2017#BlackTwitter has spotted #Ntlemeza with unknown lady. #NtlemezaVsMbalula @Julius_S_Malema @tumisole @MbalulaFikile pic.twitter.com/LaJGVW6IAT&mdash; #Vusimuzi_Ntombela (@CallMeVoto) April 24, 2017#Ntlemeza driving a stolen state car.
