"The continued degradation of human rights remains a source of concern for the stability of the country."Guelleh has held power for 18 years in the country, strategically positioned on the Red Sea and home to several foreign military bases.He won a fourth term in April 2016 with more than 86% of the vote in an election that opposition parties denounced as an "electoral masquerade".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
