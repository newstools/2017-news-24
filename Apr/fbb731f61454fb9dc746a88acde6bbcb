"In many developing countries, current national coverage targets are based on achieving access to basic infrastructure, which may not always provide continuously safe and reliable services," the WHO warned in a statement.The World Bank has meanwhile estimated that investments in infrastructure will need to triple to $114 billion per year - not including operating and maintenance costs - in order to meet the SDG targets."This is a challenge we have the ability to solve," said Guy Ryder, Chair of UN-Water and head of the International Labour Organisation. "Increased investments in water and sanitation can yield substantial benefits for human health and development, generate employment and make sure that we leave no one behind," he added.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
