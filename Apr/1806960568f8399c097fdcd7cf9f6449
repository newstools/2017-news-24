The social media campaign was dubbed #FreeStellaNyazi. About 68 Ugandan writers, editors and bloggers were calling on the government to drop the charges against Nyanzi. The Ugandan activist was charged with the&nbsp;cyber harassment of President Yoweri Museveni, after she reportedly called him a "pair of buttocks". She, however, said that she had done nothing wrong as she wrote in metaphors.Nyanzi's social media posts were a reaction to the government's decision to go back on an election campaign promise to provide free sanitary pads for girls unable to afford hygiene products. Meanwhile, according to the&nbsp;BBC, Nyanzi's lawyer has claimed that his client has been denied access to her family and legal team.
