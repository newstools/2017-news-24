The paper put the number of dead hippos at eight, and said the deaths had occurred within the space of a fortnight.In a post to Facebook, the Bhejane Trust said the insecticide used could possibly be carbaryl, which is used to control aphids and other outdoor pests. State media did not confirm the nature of the pesticide but quoted Environment Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri as saying villagers were using chemicals likely " to spray the worms in order to protect crops." It is not clear if that was a reference to army worms, which have been wreaking havoc on Zimbabwe's maize and other cereal crops in the southern African region.Investigations are continuing.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
