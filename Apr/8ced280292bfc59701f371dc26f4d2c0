"But what is really important is not to buy, but to read."Many of the booksellers offer second-hand stock in so-called "bookshops on the floor", selling them directly from the pavement.As the city prepared for its year of the word, this traditional method was mixed in with more conventional bookstands set up for the ceremony, where children's books nestled next to encyclopaedias.Underfunding&nbsp;For a country struggling with high rates of poverty, buying books can slip as a priority when it is sometimes difficult to meet basic needs, a gap the World Book Capital concept hopes to address. Sansy Kaba Diakite, the director of the project in Guinea, said a digital lending initiative will offer an alternative to underfunded and neglected African libraries, and promised that Conakry's citizens would not be the only ones to benefit."Exercise books, books in schools, in universities and bookshops" were being distributed in four provincial locations, he said, with the particular aim of celebrating Guinean authors including Camara Laye, a pioneer of francophone African literature, and novelist Tierno Monenembo.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
