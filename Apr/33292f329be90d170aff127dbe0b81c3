"I want a copy in English so that I can go and consult with my client. We need to know what the confession is about."He pointed out that he could not even take the compact disc of the recorded statement to his client in prison for a translation because prisoners were not allowed to have access to computers.Another lawyer argued that statements that were in English, had been transcribed and then reduced to point form, based on what the transcriber thought the accused was saying or meant. There were fears that a non-neutral party, like an investigating officer, may have provided the transcription and translations.The lawyers also asked that the photographs provided be printed out in colour, because the black and whites on offer did not provide sharp enough detail, in their opinion. That would mean multiple albums being printed out for the defence.One of the defence lawyers, Mike Pothier, rose to suggest that they go old school and simply transcribe all the recorded vocals in the original language, and then have them interpreted, and presented as hard copies.This way, lawyers could analyse what was said, and ask the accused questions of clarity.Accused to remain in custodyThere was also a suggestion among the team that the court interpreters go with the lawyers to the prisons where the men are in custody to have their statements translated, as well as for the "confessions" by up to eight of the accused.The court heard it would take about two days per accused to complete translations and interpretation.With wide eyes, the interpreter on duty pointed out that they were already short staffed, and it would be against the rules for them to interpret outside of a court room. They would need an official application to their manager, and permission to be granted for this.Judge Robert Henney suggested roping in retired court interpreters and outside certified interpreters instead.Eventually, with other cases on his roll, and in the interests of a fair trial, Henney ordered the entire legal team - the prosecution, and the police and the Department of Correctional Services - to go away and put their heads together and figure out a way of sorting it all out, with certified interpreters and translators.They did not even get to the issue of transporting all the required officials to the accused, or all of the accused and the officials to one meeting place for the task. This was also to be resolved outside of court time.The accused looked irritated and crestfallen as they were led out again to their prison transport by a posse of policemen. They will remain in custody until the teams regroup again in court on May 12. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
