That deal later fell apart after the buyer defaulted.The gem is the largest flawless fancy vivid pink diamond ever graded by the Gemological Institute of America.Sotheby's says the buyer is Hong Kong jewellery company Chow Tai Fook , which beat out two other telephone bidders.Until now, the most expensive diamond ever sold at auction was the "Oppenheimer Blue," which fetched $57.6m in May last year. The previous world auction record for a pink diamond was $46.2m for the 24.78 carat "Graff Pink" in 2010.Sotheby's decided the time was right to bring the diamond back to the market because of rising demand from wealthy Asian buyers.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
