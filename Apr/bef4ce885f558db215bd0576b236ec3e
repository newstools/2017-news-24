He said the NDC never gave him the witness statements he requested, and he had asked the ANC's national executive committee to address the matter.A regime change faction was hell-bent on destroying the party&rsquo;s leaders, he said.&ldquo;There are mercenaries in the ANC hell-bent on winning the national conference in 2017.&rdquo;A faction led by former tourism minister Derek Hanekom wanted to work him out of the party and take over the party leadership at its elective conference in December, he claimed.&ldquo;They will politically take you out, they will physically take you out to take your position. Pity the ANC has been put into this position.&rdquo;In November 2016, the NDC found Fransman guilty of using his office to gain &ldquo;sexual favours&rdquo; from his former personal assistant, Louisa Wynand, and for making public statements which brought the ANC into disrepute. Fransman did not attend his hearing and dismissed it as a kangaroo court.He appealed the sentence. The ANC's disciplinary appeals committee referred the matter back to the NDC to ensure Fransman&rsquo;s hearing had been procedurally fair.Wynand opened a case with police in January 2016, accusing Fransman of sexual assault. They were travelling to the party&rsquo;s January 8 celebrations in Rustenburg, North West, when he allegedly touched her inappropriately in the car.She said she was forced to share a bed with him in a Kimberley hotel on January 5, where he allegedly also touched her inappropriately. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
