The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) in the Free State has made a clarion call to consumers to continue using water sparingly. This follows a decrease in water levels in the various dams, with some below 20%.Kido Thoabala, spokesperson for the department, said a report the department had issued on 4 April showed that water levels in the various dams in the province have decreased by 1,2%. Thoabala said water levels in dams in the province currently stood at 84%. She said the current state was better compared to 53% around this time last year. Many dams have shown significant improvement with some dams in the province reaching their capacity for the first time in a long time. Dams such as Saulspoort and Welbedacht have reached full capacity while Tierpoort, Kalkfontein and Groothoek remain below 20%.Thoabala said given the current situation, water restrictions would remain in force until water in dams reached satisfactory levels. Consumers are advised to continue using water sparingly and to save every drop. Winter is upon us and, given historical rain patterns, dam levels are not expected to rise during this period, said Thoabala.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
