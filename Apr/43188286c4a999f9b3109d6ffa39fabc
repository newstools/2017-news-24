We are focusing on several different areas in the ward, and we have primary and middle high school learners involved in the programme. The children take part in this with pride and of course they enjoy the lunch and juice provided for them, Higgins said. He added that the areas cleaned by the children would be utilised to build a total of seven recreational parks within the next financial year. The kids are cleaning up areas that would eventually become parks for them, so this clean-up campaign is for their own benefit. This is a very exciting prospect for them. Higgins added that the ward has exciting Youth Month programmes planned for the children in June.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
