It is now, however, commercially cultivated in Australia, which has similar climatic conditions to SA.Sinazo is among 635 honours graduates for UWC's autumn 2017 graduation season. She is also in the top three for biotechnology at UWC.Sinazo is currently studying toward her masters degree in biotechnology at the university.&nbsp;"I am looking forward to this new chapter of my life, but at the moment I am focusing on my masters," she said.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
