It mainly affects girls," he said.The minister spoke at the launch of a project to fight child labour in Tunisia over the next three years, which was developed with the International Labour Organisation and has received $3m in funding from the United States.Naima Zaghdoudi, national co-ordinator for the project, said child labour in Tunisia seemed to be most common in "agriculture, mainly in family-run farms", in domestic work for young girls, small carpentry workshops, garages and hairdressers.But "we can't talk about a child labour phenomenon today in Tunisia because there isn't really any data", she said.In an attempt to remedy this, she said the National Statistics Institute would survey 15 000 homes to obtain statistics on child labour that should be known in September.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
