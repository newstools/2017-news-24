It would have been agonising and prolonged. It was also totally unnecessary," the organisation said in a statement on Monday.Because there was no footage of the protest in which the perpetrators could be identified, an investigation into the cruelty would be complicated.Netwerk24 reported that roads to and from the town were re-opened on Monday afternoon after more protest action in the morning. Residents of&nbsp;Blydeville are protesting for housing and better service delivery.Roads to Ottosdal, Coligny and Sannieshof were blocked by protesters.In Coligny, protesters looted a liquor store and stole cool drinks.&nbsp;According to Netwerk24, the protesters are angry about the death of a 12-year-old child in a car accident last week. The circumstances surrounding the child's death is still unclear.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
