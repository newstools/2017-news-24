Mali's north fell under the control of jihadist groups linked to Al-Qaeda in 2012 who hijacked an ethnic Tuareg-led uprising, though the Islamists were largely ousted by a French-led military operation in January 2013.But swathes of the country remain beyond the control of Malian, French and UN forces, which face regular attacks despite a 2015 peace deal that was supposed to isolate the jihadists once and for all.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
