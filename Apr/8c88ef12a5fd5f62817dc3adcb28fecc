	     Washington - SpaceX CEO and founder Elon Musk said he wants to go further in re-using his rockets after successfully launching the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket that was recycled from a previous flight. Musk tweeted that he is looking into a test to bring home the second stage of the company's new Falcon 9 Heavy rocket for re-use when the rocket debuts late in the summer. SpaceX blasted off the recycled first stage, or booster, of a Falcon 9 rocket for the first time on Thursday, a feat that could dramatically lower the cost of space travel. The Falcon 9 Heavy has a first stage composed of three Falcon 9 engine cores and "will be the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two," according to the company website. Solid ground "Considering trying to bring upper stage back on Falcon Heavy demo flight for full re-usability," Musk wrote. "Odds of success low," he said, "but maybe worth a shot." He then added: "Falcon Heavy test flight currently scheduled for late summer." SpaceX has for 15 years been honing the technology of powering its boosters back to careful Earth landings on solid ground and in the water. The goal is to make rocket parts as re-usable as cars, planes or bicycles, Musk has said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
