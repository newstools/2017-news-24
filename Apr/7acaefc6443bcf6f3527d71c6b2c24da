Such behaviour is an antithesis to the health and pluralistic society we seek to build where the contestation of ideas thrives," the ANC said."Freedom of conscience and association are inalienable rights granted to all under the Constitution. South African history is littered with violence and media suppression. Political intolerance would take South Africa back to a painful past that should not be repeated."Threats made against individuals because of their political or ideological beliefs is indicative of intellectual and moral bankruptcy."Those who plot in dark corners and make anonymous threats, as well and other forms of intimidation of others, should pursue principled and legitimate forms of engagement instead of resorting to cowardly acts.The ANC called on South Africans to "unite behind our common vision of a pluralistic society and jealously guard our hard won freedoms - including freedom of speech and association". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
