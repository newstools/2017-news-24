According to East African, Information and Culture Minister Lai Mohammed claimed to have received numerous reports of looters also burying money in deep forests and their backyards.Senior Special Advisor to the minister, Segun Adeyemi, was quoted as saying that, since a whistle blower policy had been introduced, the government had received tremendous support from Nigerians.He further stated that the minister was grateful to Nigerians for their resolve in helping the government tackle graft by providing useful leads to government agencies."Yes, there is monetary reward for any information that leads to recovery of looted funds, but from what we have seen; most of the Nigerians who have come forward with useful leads were driven by patriotism, rather than reward. Nigerians have daily inundated the offices of the appropriate government agencies with valuable information,&rsquo;" Adeyemi was quoted as saying.
