Post-mortems would confirm the cause of death.The provincial health department said only one child had died, while three adults and three children were given medical care.Smith would not be drawn into speculation until the lab tests and autopsy results were available."However, it does appear that the incident is isolated to one household as no further information or evidence has been presented to suggest that anyone else has been affected."He extended his condolences to the family of the children and said the city would do everything it could to get the answers they needed. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
