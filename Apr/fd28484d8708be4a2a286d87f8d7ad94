I found people torn up... some people, only half of their bodies remained," said Nabil Nader, who lives in front of the Tanta church.The worshippers had been celebrating Palm Sunday, one of the holiest days of the Christian calendar, marking the triumphant entrance of Jesus to Jerusalem.Pope prays for victimsFrancis, who is due to visit Cairo on April 28-29, offered prayers for the victims."Let us pray for the victims of the attack unfortunately carried out today," he said in an Angelus prayer."May the Lord convert the heart of those who sow terror, violence and death and also the heart of those who make weapons and trade in them."Copts, who make up about one tenth of Egypt's population of more than 92 million and who celebrate Easter next weekend, have been targeted by several attacks in recent months.Jihadists and Islamists accuse Copts of supporting the military overthrow of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, which ushered in a deadly crackdown on his supporters.In December, a suicide bombing claimed by IS killed 29 worshippers during Sunday mass in Cairo.
