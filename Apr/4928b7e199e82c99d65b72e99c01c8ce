Without God I would never have made it. Teaching children can be compared to a potter who is using clay to mould something and at the end you have a product. I have enjoyed my teaching career to the fullest,&rdquo; Japtha said.For her teaching was a constant learning curve because of the changes that took place continuously. &ldquo;The highlight of my career is the joy it brought to my heart when I see the faces of these learners at the end of the day knowing that I&rsquo;ve made a difference in their lives.&rdquo; Her passing message to the learners and fellow staff members she is leaving behind is, &ldquo;Education is vital, therefore, I would like to encourage all learners to go to school and do their best and to all educators not to give up but to do what their calling is for.&rdquo;Principal Dudley Erasmus, who had been teaching with Japtha for 38 years, said the school would miss this very versatile teacher, who could easily teach both Foundation and Intermediate Phase. &ldquo;The learners loved her very much. We as staff will miss her expertise and her mentoring of educators. I am confident that she will reap the fruits and enjoy the shade of the trees that she has planted.&rdquo; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
