The police's Sabata Mokgwabone said that roads to and from surrounding areas such as Ottosdal, Coligny and Sannieshof were re-opened on Monday afternoon after being barricaded by dissatisfied Lichtenburg protesters protesting over housing and better service delivery. Four trucks were set alight in the area, including a truck transporting 38 000 chicks on Friday. Opti Chicks, the company supplying the chicks said in a statement that some of the chicks were thrown off the truck, and were then run over with another truck. On Tuesday afternoon, protesters looted a liquor store, and allegedly set three trucks alight in Coligny, a few kilometres from Lichtenburg, over an unrelated matter. "It is quiet here in Lichtenburg, although we are experiencing a challenge of another situation in Coligny, but we have sent our members to the scene," said Mokgwabone. According to Mokgwabone, the protesters in Coligny are angry about the death of a 12-year-old boy who died in a car accident last week. "The boy was injured after he jumped from a farmer's moving vehicle. He died a little while later. We have opened an inquest to determine the circumstances of the death, but the community thinks there is no justice for the child, hence the protests. "Maybe they should have consulted with us before protesting as we are investigating the matter," said Mokgwabone.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
