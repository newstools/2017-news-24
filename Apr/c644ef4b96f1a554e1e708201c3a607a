The City's Environmental Health Department can therefore confirm that the chicken was safe for consumption when bought," he said.The children, from the Samora Machel informal settlement, died on Monday. It was initially reported that three children died."The samples tested include the remaining chicken which was still frozen and the gravy which remained in the pot after the meal was consumed. None of the cooked chicken was available for testing as this was all consumed at the time of the meal," Smith said.Environmental health officials visited the farm where the live chicken was bought, the vendor who sold the family this chicken, and the home of the victims in Samora Machel, Smith said.They were satisfied that there was no cause for concern about how the chicken was reared and stored.Police are investigating.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
