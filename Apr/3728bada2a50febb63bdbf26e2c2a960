It provided for the provision of general and specific advice to the speaker, the municipal manager and any official/politician sanctioned by the manager, and guidance about the municipality&rsquo;s functioning&nbsp; and &ldquo;anything in addition or incidental&rdquo;.The Municipal Finance Management Act prescribes that consultants can only be appointed if the necessary skills or resources to perform a project are not available, and the accounting officer cannot be reasonably expected either to train or to recruit people in the time available, Ntabazalila explained.&ldquo;There was already an existing service provider who had been performing such work for the municipality. No urgency or exceptional circumstances existed. IBR was hastily registered on the supplier database even before the deviation application was approved. The services required were not specialised,&rdquo; he said.IBR&rsquo;s invoices did not contain any sufficient details of how and on which particular assignment the hours charged for were spent.&ldquo;The total number of hours worked (and paid for) and kilometres travelled are excessive. The instructions to IBR and payments were manipulated to prevent them from being detected during audits and to create the impression that the procurement obtained fell within the set R200 000 limit,&rdquo; he said.Procurement above R200 000 had to be done via a competitive bidding process. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
