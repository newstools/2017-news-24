In recent months the trio have been granted bail, but they were still languishing in jail. &ldquo;Unfortunately, the Buhari&nbsp;administration does not seem to appreciate that we are operating a democratic dispensation, otherwise, once a court has ordered that somebody be released on bail as in the case of Colonel Sambo Dasuki and Nnamdi Kanu, the government cannot dance around it,&rdquo; a public affairs analyst, Haruna Elbinawi was quoted as saying.&nbsp;Reports have indicated the government has refused to release Kanu on bail, despite court rulings from at least three judges, including a regional tribunal.Fifty years ago a unilateral declaration of an independent Republic of Biafra led to a brutal civil war that left hundreds of thousands dead, mainly from starvation and disease.The conflict ended in 1970.Meanwhile, West Africa's regional court last year ordered the immediate release of Dasuki, saying that his detention in 2015 was "unlawful" and "arbitrary".In its judgement, the three-member court held that his arrest and detention "without charge or judicial order after having been granted bail by three different domestic courts is unlawful, arbitrary and violates international laws."Dasuki allegedly oversaw a sprawling embezzlement scheme that saw "phantom contracts" awarded for personal gain, as under-equipped and demoralised troops fought better-armed militants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
