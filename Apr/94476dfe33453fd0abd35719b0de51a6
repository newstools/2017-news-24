On March 29, the Electoral Court postponed a by-election in Ward 7 of the Phongolo local municipality after the names of people who did not live in the ward were found on the voters&rsquo; roll. It was postponed to June 14. &ldquo;Our legal system should demand answers from individuals whose names are illegally on the voters&rsquo; roll and they will have to explain how it all happened,&rdquo; she said. People were custodians of the Constitution and they had to expose those behind &ldquo;expensive expeditions&rdquo; to steal elections. Dube-Ncube dissolved the Nquthu municipality&rsquo;s council in February, after the councillors elected in the August 2016 local government elections repeatedly failed to elect office bearers, including the mayor, deputy mayor, and speaker. As a result, the by-election would include all 17 ward and 16 PR council seats. There are 76 606 registered voters in Nquthu&rsquo;s 116 voting districts. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
