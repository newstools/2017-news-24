Kaveel SinghPretoria &ndash; Despite some administrative confusion, the Save SA march to the Union Buildings has been granted permission to go ahead, a spokesperson said on Thursday evening.&ldquo;We had our lawyers file an urgent application with the chief magistrate, setting out our efforts to obtain permission. She considered the application and overturned the prohibition. We are waiting to get the papers in the next few minutes,&rdquo; Save SA spokesperson Mark Heywood told News24. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He said the organisation followed all procedures to get permission for the march to call for President Jacob Zuma to step down.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suspect some political interference. It looks like a wrong administrative decision was made.&rdquo; &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
