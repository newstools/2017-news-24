That was the very premise of my tweets. Anyone who read them without a personal or political agenda would have understood that. If you say the consequences of something were not only negative, you are saying most were negative," she said."But if there was anyone who genuinely thought I was praising, defending, or justifying colonialism, I apologised unreservedly and stressed that this was not so. I do so again now," Zille said.She is expected to report to Advocate Glynnis Breytenbach, chairperson of the DA's federal legal commission, after consulting with her lawyers, before a date for the hearings - which are expected to last two days - will be decided. &nbsp;Open hearingsNews24 asked if the party had considered opening the disciplinary hearings, given the unprecedented public interest.Horn said the party constitution didn't allow the media or the public to attend the hearings and the party treats disciplinary hearings as internal matters."From federal legal commission point of view, everyone is equal before the law and we really want to give everyone who stands accused the same fair treatment or trial, within the rules of the DA," Horn said.The panel is tasked with listening to testimony, reviewing evidence, making factual findings, and then deciding whether Zille is guilty of misconduct or not.According to party's constitution, if the panel finds her guilty, it will recommend a sanction that will be taken to the DA's federal executive council, which will decide if the sanction is appropriate or not.Senior DA members have privately called for strong action against Zille, warning that the party's decision could have implications for its fortunes at the 2019 national and provincial polls, especially in Gauteng. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
