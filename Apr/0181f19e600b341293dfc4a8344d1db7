Kodwa said the ANC was confident that May Day will be used with "dignity and respect", to reflect the struggles and victories of the working people 23 years into democracy.Tensions had heightened within the tripartite alliance, following Zuma's dramatic Cabinet reshuffle on March 30, which he did without consulting SACP, Cosatu, and senior ANC leaders.In a letter dated April 21, Nehawu wrote to Cosatu's national office bearers asking that Ramaphosa replace Zuma as speaker at the Bloemfontein event.The CWU echoed this in a subsequent letter to Cosatu general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali. On Friday, Cosatu in Gauteng said Zuma should be barred from attending.ANC treasurer general Zweli Mkhize would attend Cosatu's rally in Cape Town, deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte would be at the federation's event in Klerksdorp, North West, and national chairperson Baleka Mbete would be Durban. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
