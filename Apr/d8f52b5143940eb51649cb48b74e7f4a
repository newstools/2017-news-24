It will snake down Plein and Spin streets and then back up Adderley and Wale streets to the cathedral.At 14:00, former finance minister Pravin Gordhan is expected to join speakers at a memorial service in the cathedral for ANC stalwart Ahmed Kathrada, who died last Tuesday.Later on Thursday, a tented camp &ldquo;Vukani [Wake up] Mzansi 2&rdquo; is expected to be erected on the pavement between the Slave Lodge Museum and the cathedral. It will serve as a central point for the pickets and cultural programme expected to last until Saturday morning.Western Cape ANC spokesperson Yonela Diko said party members would respect the right to participate in civil action, and not stage counter-marches to defend Zuma. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
