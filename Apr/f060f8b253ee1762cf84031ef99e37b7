If so, he wanted to know if this violated the Constitution or any other law.Gordhan, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and SACP members attended meetings with President Jacob Zuma before his Cabinet reshuffle on March 30. They said he based his decision to recall Gordhan from an investor roadshow in the UK on an "intelligence report".The report allegedly implicated Gordhan and Jonas in a plot to undermine Zuma's government, with the assistance of international financial firms.African National Congress secretary general Gwede Mantashe however told reporters last week that the party accepted that Zuma fired Gordhan because of an "irretrievable breakdown of trust", and not because of an intelligence report.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
