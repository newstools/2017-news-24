We do not have an understanding that as ANC president he is [not] allowed to attend Cosatu activities," Ntshalintshali wrote at the time.Nehawu and CWU rightfully wants to know why Cosatu invited Zuma to address the May Day rally when they claim to have lost confidence in him. pic.twitter.com/wvYeF7kccD&mdash; IG: ConceptSixty5 (@Sentletse) April 26, 2017Nehawu and CWU rightfully wants to know why Cosatu invited Zuma to address the May Day rally when they claim to have lost confidence in him. pic.twitter.com/wvYeF7kccD24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
