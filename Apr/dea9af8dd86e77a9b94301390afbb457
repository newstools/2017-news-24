The Gauteng branch of the ANC also joined in after a state memorial was cancelled, with government communications saying it could not agree on the logistics with Kathrada&rsquo;s family."Let me say&hellip; publically and openly that postponing the official memorial was petty and spiteful," said Gordhan.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
