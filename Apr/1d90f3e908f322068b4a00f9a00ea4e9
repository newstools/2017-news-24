Then I saw that this fire comes from the spaza shop. We residents started to rush to the scene. While we were on the way to the scene we heard a voice of a man saying &lsquo;please help&rsquo;."It was the voice of the foreign guy who was running a spaza shop in this container. We tried to help, but we could not because the fire was very strong and the container was surrounded by tyres," she said.Another resident said the container arrived four weeks ago. "People who have businesses around the village were not happy for this foreign guy to run a business here. I suspect that these business people are involved in this matter.
