The SACP welcomes the ANC's acceptance of our party's proposal to for a meeting on the decision."But it is completely unacceptable to scapegoat the SACP for the lack of consultation by President Jacob Zuma," the SACP said.Leak allegations rejectedThe party said Zuma reshuffled the Cabinet without even consulting the ANC itself on the other positions that were affected and names that were "decided elsewhere", as confirmed by ANC officials in response to the president's unilateral decision."The SACP rejects as baseless the allegation that the party leaked information from its bilateral engagements held last week with the ANC and thereby breached confidentiality commitment."On the contrary, and as we have said, the leak clearly came from the ranks of the ANC, and sought to portray the SACP as if the party had agreed to the reshuffling of the former finance minister Pravin Gordhan, whereas that was untrue," the statement reads."It was, in fact, the leak that compelled the SACP to convene a press briefing on Thursday 30 March to set the record straight. This good decision to set the record straight was taken in good faith because the SACP does not communicate by means of leaks."The SACP said it would engage further with the ANC on this matter. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
