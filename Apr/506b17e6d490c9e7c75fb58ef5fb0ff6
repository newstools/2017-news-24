The recent securitisation of Parliament has made it less transparent and open, but has not stopped genuine security breaches such as this one."In light of this, we call on the SAPS and Parliamentary security to conduct a thorough investigation into this burglary and bring the criminals responsible to book."The Democratic Alliance meanwhile has called on the Inspector-General of Intelligence, Dr Sethlomamaru Isaac Dintwe, to investigate the State Security Agency's "possible involvement".DA MP Phumzile Van Damme said the break in was "stunningly suspicious"."We view this latest 'break-in' as part of a much bigger, co-ordinated campaign to intimidate and threaten SABC journalists."The party would also ask the Parliamentary Speaker Baleka Mbete to investigate the suspicious circumstances under which the theft took place - considering the security measures already in place. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
