"We are not satisfied with the conduct of the federal government and the military establishment," the letter said.Nigerian officials did not respond to requests for comment.Boko Haram's mass abduction of 276 girls from a boarding school in April 2014 brought promises to help free them from around the world.Dozens quickly escaped, and 21 were freed in October through negotiations with Boko Haram mediated by the Swiss government and the International Committee of the Red Cross.The government denied a ransom was paid and that it freed some detained Boko Haram fighters in exchange for the girls.At that time, officials said they were pressing on with negotiations and expected the release of a second group of 83 girls "very soon." No more have been freed.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
