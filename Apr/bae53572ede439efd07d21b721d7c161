	     Monrovia - United Nations officials say at least 11 people have died from a mysterious illness in Liberia, and tests have been negative for the Ebola virus. The World Health Organisation said on Friday that authorities were looking into whether the people were sickened by something they ate or were exposed to a chemical or bacteria. Five others remain hospitalised in Sinoe County, about 400km outside the capital, after complaining of abdominal pains. Two are critically ill. The cases over the past week have evoked painful memories in Liberia, where more than 4 800 people died during the Ebola epidemic. Those who fell sick this week all had attended a relative's funeral.  That was how many Ebola victims contracted the disease when they came in contact with victims' corpses. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
