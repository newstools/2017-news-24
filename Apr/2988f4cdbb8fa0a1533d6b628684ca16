They deny the charges.Separatist sentiment among the Igbo people of southeast Nigeria has grown in the months since his arrest and sparked bloody clashes with the security forces.The government has previously refused to release Kanu on bail, despite court rulings from at least three judges, including a regional tribunal of the West African bloc Ecowas.Fifty years ago on May 30, a unilateral declaration of an independent Republic of Biafra led to civil war that left hundreds of thousands dead, mainly from starvation and disease.Most of them were Igbos. The conflict ended in 1970.Kanu's lawyer Ifeanyi Ejiofor told reporters outside court: "We are happy at the court ruling this morning. We are very sure we will fulfil the conditions for bail."He said they would "resist any attempt by the Federal Government to flout this order", adding that if that happened, "we will not subject Nnamdi Kanu to further trial".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
