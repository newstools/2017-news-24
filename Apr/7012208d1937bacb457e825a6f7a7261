It is typically caught from infected water supplies, resulting in severe vomiting and diarrhea."We usually know when El Nino is coming six to 12 months before it occurs," said study leader Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Bloomberg School."Knowing there is elevated cholera risk in a particular region can help reduce the number of deaths that result," he said."If you have cholera treatment centers available, fast, supportive care can reduce the fatality rate from cholera from as high as 30% to next to nothing."El Nino conditions in the equatorial Pacific strongly impact weather conditions globally, including increasing rainfall in East Africa and decreasing rainfall in drier areas of northern and southern Africa.In some areas, heavy rainfalls can cause sewers to overrun and contaminate drinking water.In other parts of Africa, the dry conditions can make clean water sources less available and people are force to consume water from contaminated sources, the researchers noted.There is a vaccine against cholera but its protection is not lifelong. In addition, there is not enough supply of the vaccine to cover the populations in the African regions where the incidence of cholera is linked to El Nino.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
