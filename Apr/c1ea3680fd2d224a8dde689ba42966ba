There is no right to education, no right to medical treatment. They are living in inhumane conditions," said Hassana Aldramly, an official at the Palestinian embassy in SA.Many prisoners were not allowed to see their lawyers, and were often tortured or left in solitary confinement for prolonged periods of time.According to human rights statistics some 6 500 Palestinians, including 57 women prisoners and 300 children as young as 11, are currently being held in Israeli jails. More than 500 of those prisoners are being held under "administrative detention" - detention without trial."Over the past 50 years more than 800 000 Palestinians have been imprisoned by the Israeli State under many explicitly racist laws and administrative regulations," Rivonia trialist Dennis Goldberg said in a statement.The solidarity action is supported by organisations including the National Coalition 4 Palestine, South African Jews for a Free Palestine, the Embassy of the State of Palestine, Ex Political Prisoners Association of South Africa, the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, and religious organisations.Dennis Goldberg could no be here, his message is read out to us.
