In a statement released on Tuesday, the police said they had found vehicle parts, recovered one 9mm magazine with ammunition, "two R5 magazines with ammunition... two gas bottles suspected to be used to strip vehicles, one stencil used to alter VIN numbers, a R200-00 fake note and various items used to manufacture fake notes".The police also found that the VIN numbers and engine numbers on some of the vehicles had been altered or destroyed, and that the vehicles had been tampered with.Police were responding to intelligence received regarding suspected stolen vehicles in the area. The police&rsquo;s Brigadier Jay Naicker confirmed that there was an investigation underway by the Pietermaritzburg Vehicle Identification Section, and that there were no suspects, and no arrests as the owner of the property was not at home during the execution of the operation.Langa appealed to communities not to support chop shops as the vehicles were obtained under cruel circumstances to the lawful owners."These thugs profit from the misery of law abiding citizens and if they are supported by members of the community then the cycle of violent crime will continue to plague this province," he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
