Or just selective protesting?Volatile rand dives sharply amid uncertaintyThe local currency is taking a beating, losing almost 2% to trade dangerously close to R13.70. By 10:50 the rand was trading at R13.68/$.&nbsp;The Save South Africa campaign is working with a growing number of civil society organisations on a coordinated programme of rolling mass action 'in defence of our democracy' over the next few days:- A People s Protest from 11h00 on Monday 3 April in Pretoria s Church Square. &nbsp;- A multi-sectoral meeting convened by the SA 1st Forum at 19h00 on Monday 3 April to discuss coordinated action in Cape Town. The meeting will be held at Oude Molen in Alexander Road, Ndabeni. &nbsp;- A People s Rally in Port Elizabeth s City Hall Square at 13h00 on Wednesday 4 April, to be addressed by former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas and Save South Africa convenor Sipho Pityana. Where was #BlackMonday for 300 years of colonialism & 48 years of aparthied? It miraculously appears when there's a cabinet reshuffle.The power of the rand has never been our business, we are landless, poverty will still have us even if it stabilises ?? #Blackmonday#BlackMonday: South Africans divided on unity callSouth Africans on Twitter seem mixed in their response with many racialising the protest and referencing the issue of land restitution and Helen Zille's colonialist remarks, as well the call for a vote of no confidence in President Zuma.Coming together against corruption #blackmonday pic.twitter.com/gYMXx6JWsuHow Pravin Gordhan Became The Leader Of The ResistanceThere was a moment on Saturday afternoon, just before he stepped from behind a screen onto the sun-drenched stage, when axed finance minister Pravin Gordhan looked at the packed Johannesburg City Hall and took a deep breath.
