The rand falls. It fell in apartheid and we will pick it up again now."Mokonyane was addressing a few hundred Zuma supporters six days after Motlanthe had read out excerpts from a letter written&nbsp; by struggle stalwart Ahmed Kathrada, at Kathrada's funeral service on March 29, in which the stalwart asked Zuma whether he would consider stepping down.Two days after Kathrada's funeral Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas were removed from their positions. On April 3, S&amp;P announced that it had downgraded South Africa's credit rating to junk status.In his interview with BBC, Motlanthe described Mokonyane's utterances "populism of the worst kind"."If the minister can say the rand can fall; we'll just pick it up, that shows a cavalier attitude toward a very very serious matter."It's populism of the worst kind where people just want to issue statements that may resonate with poor people who have no understanding of the bigger issue so it's really disheartening," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
