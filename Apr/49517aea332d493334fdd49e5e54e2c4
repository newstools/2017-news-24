Let us retain the dignity we have because every time we get to a place like Polokwane, we lose some of our members. We cannot afford it now.&rdquo;&nbsp;Sisulu, who is believed to be a leading candidate for ANC president in December, was delivering the Lillian Ngoyi memorial lecture for ANC ward 87 in Khayelitsha.&nbsp;She said she disagreed with a statement by former president Kgalema Motlanthe the ANC should first reach &ldquo;rock bottom&rdquo; for it to be saved.&nbsp;&ldquo;The country depends on a strong ANC. Never mind what they are saying about us out there, ultimately, they depend on us who rescued them from oppression,&rdquo; Sisulu said.&nbsp;&ldquo;We cannot reign over the demise of the ANC with the hope that through some magical wand we will find our way out.&rdquo;&nbsp;Sisulu said the point Motlanthe was making is that the ANC is on a steep decline to &ldquo;rock bottom.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Today we are living in an era where we are more defined by the strife&rsquo;s in the ANC than by the gains we have made in government,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&ldquo;The dignity of the ANC on a regular basis is disintegrating&hellip; The people&rsquo;s trust in our movement is paramount and we dare not experiment with it.&rdquo; &nbsp;Support of the young peopleFormer Wits SRC president Mcebo Dlamini attended the lecture where he endorsed Sisulu&rsquo;s candidacy for ANC president.&ldquo;Comrade Lindiwe has the undivided support of young people, mostly underprivileged, those that still live in squatter camps and squalor,&rdquo; Dlamini told News24.&nbsp;&ldquo;She is exposing the real suffering that Africans live under so she has our support.
