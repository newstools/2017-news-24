Monday's mass hunger strike was scheduled to coincide with Palestinian "Prisoners Day," an annual event held in solidarity with the more than 6 000 Palestinian security prisoners incarcerated in Israeli jails.Military hospitalShortly after last week's announcement of the hunger strike, Israeli Minister of Public Security Gilad Erdan asked for the creation of a military hospital to ensure that hunger-striking Palestinian prisoners were not transferred to civilian hospitals, which have so far refused to force feed hunger-striking Palestinian prisoners, Bethlehem-based Ma'an News Agency reported. IPS spokesperson Assaf Librati was quoted by the Times of Israel as saying that the hunger strikers would be disciplined. &ldquo;The prisons service has started taking disciplinary measures against the strikers and in addition a number of prisoners have been transferred to separate wings,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is to be emphasised that the [prison service] does not negotiate with prisoners,&rdquo; he said. In his op-ed published on Monday, Barghouti described hunger striking as "the most peaceful form of resistance available"."It inflicts pain solely on those who participate and on their loved ones, in the hopes that their empty stomachs and their sacrifice will help the message resonate beyond the confines of their dark cells."Responding to Barghouti's hunger strike, Yisrael Katz, Israeli Intelligence Minister, described the Palestinian leader as&nbsp;a "despicable murderer" and called for the "death penalty for terrorists". Israeli authorities have arrested about one million Palestinians since 1948 and the subsequent occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip in 1967. On Saturday, Amnesty International said that "Israel&rsquo;s decades-long policy of detaining Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza in prisons inside Israel and depriving them of regular family visits is not only cruel but also a blatant violation of international law". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
