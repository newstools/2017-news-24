She confirmed she had swum ashore but her husband was missing.NSRI treated her for hypothermia.TrappedDuring a search along the shoreline, Deon was found trapped by the high tide on rocks near the lighthouse.Two rescue swimmers came to his assistance.He was extremely distressed about the whereabouts of his wife but was reassured, much to his relief, that she was safe, said Lambinon.He was also treated for hypothermia.The rubber duck was recovered from the water. The couple are originally from the East Rand in Johannesburg.Lambinon urged boaters to be cautious offshore of the lighthouse, where a number a wrecks littered the coastline.&ldquo;The water depth at high tide can reach as much as 14 meters but drops to only a few meters at low tide causing a natural unpredictable breaking swell in that vicinity, caused by the geography of the coastline there and a danger to boaters.&rdquo; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
