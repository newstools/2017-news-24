My colleagues had to come to my assistance to handcuff him..." TP: Is that correct?&nbsp;MG: Yes&nbsp;TP: But in your evidence, you said you did not have any role in the handcuffing of Siyoni&nbsp;MG: In that office, we were four&nbsp;MG: Everyone in that office assisted to handcuff him&nbsp;TP: I am asking you questions, can you please stop ducking them?&nbsp;TP: The next sentence cannot be true based on what you said today...&nbsp;TP: You say that when you went to handcuff Siyoni, he scuffled and he scratched himself with the handcuffs&nbsp;TP: Now just to remind you, today you said you never saw any injury and you had no idea how he got the injury&nbsp;MG: I did say he had a scratch&nbsp;TP: No you didn't, you said you heard from someone else he had a scratch, it is very different to what you say there.&nbsp;MG: I heard about the scratch and saw the scratch&nbsp;TP: You never said that&nbsp;MG: During the scuffle when they wanted to handcuff him, I did not see the scratch&nbsp;TP: So you will not be able to explain how he knew you and Mayi were in Fort Beaufort that morning?&nbsp;MG: I do not know where he would have known that&nbsp;TP: I refer the court to your affidavit&nbsp;TP: I want you to confirm, is this your signature?&nbsp;MG: Yes&nbsp;TP: And you agree that it is commissioned on the 21st July 2016 by Mayi?&nbsp;MG: Yes&nbsp;TP: Who wrote it?&nbsp;MG: I did&nbsp;TP: You wrote it and Mayi commissioned it?&nbsp;MG: Yes&nbsp;TP: And this statement is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?&nbsp;MG: Yes&nbsp;TP: I want to refer you to the typed version&nbsp;[TP reads from the statement]&nbsp;TP: Have you even heard of people being tubed?&nbsp;MG: I have never heard of it&nbsp;TP: On the 28th, were you with Mayi when he went with Alice?&nbsp;MG: Yes, we went back to Alice&nbsp;TP: And as Mayi testified, you would have had to go through Fort Beaufort&nbsp;MG: Yes, that is correct, the bed and breakfast we were sleeping in was in Fort Beaufort&nbsp;TP: So on the 28th, you were in Fort Beaufort&nbsp;MG: Yes&nbsp;TP: Can you give me an indication what time that would have been?&nbsp;TP: Let me ask differently - was it in the morning?&nbsp;MG: Yes&nbsp;TP: Did you see Siyoni?&nbsp;MG: No&nbsp;TP: Did you ever see an injury on Siyoni?&nbsp;MG: No&nbsp;TP: Not a mark&nbsp;MG: I didn't see. Only one thing, was a scratch above his left eye.&nbsp;TP: I'm not interested in what was said, did you see it?&nbsp;MG: No I did not see it&nbsp;TP: It is common cause that his eye was swollen&nbsp;MG: I did not see it&nbsp;TP: It is common cause, and it has gone unchallenged, Siyoni said the police had, and it is a Afrikaans word, that police "moered" him.&nbsp;MG: I did not know that&nbsp;[TP reads from court record where he asked Mayi if he had the names of Siyoni and Chris prior to leaving Alice.
