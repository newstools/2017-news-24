He said people started questioning, "Why me?" and when they don't get the whole explanation, they feel let down."Maybe one day, when you are old, [you will be told], 'Remember that night we woke you up and said you must do something? Well this was the true picture'."I'm not saying we should follow blindly, but sometimes, we need to exercise revolutionary discipline," Molefe said.&nbsp;President Jacob Zuma also attended the event, calling on ANC comrades to not use memorials as political platforms in what was a thinly-veiled attack on Gordhan, who has been speaking out against Zuma at several memorials for struggle stalwart Ahmed Kathrada.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
