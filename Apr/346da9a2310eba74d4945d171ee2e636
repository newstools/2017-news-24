	     Cairo - The remains of an Egyptian pyramid built about 3 700 years ago have been discovered near the well-known bent pyramid of King Snefru, the antiquities ministry says. The pyramid from the 13th dynasty was found in Dahshur's royal necropolis, 30km south of Cairo, it said. "An alabaster... block engraved with 10 vertical hieroglyphic lines" was among the finds, the ministry said, citing Adel Okasha, director general at the necropolis. It said "granite lintel and stone blocks showing the interior design of the pyramid" were also found. Excavation is still in its early stages and the size of the pyramid has not yet been established.  "All the discovered parts of the pyramid are in very good condition and further excavation is to take place to reveal more parts," the ministry said. Egypt, home of one of the world's earliest civilisations, boasts 123 ancient pyramids, said Zahi Hawas, former head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities. They include the world-famous Pyramids of Giza, constructed about 4 500 years ago. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
