Those he had touched vowed to raise money for projects in his honour.He had been a volunteer for the educational charity SAVE Foundation, helping out at the school it ran in Dunoon, Table View.Foundation manager Gail Strauss said he embodied what a volunteer should be &ndash; compassionate, creative, charismatic, and generous.The lanky teen had been popular with the children. They loved to huddle around him and play with his long, dark hair."He dreamed of one day becoming a Nobel Prize-winning scientist and opening a restaurant in Cape Town where volunteers could eat for free," she said.It is understood that Otterbeck, and volunteers from countries including Holland, Israel, Denmark and Sweden, had been walking along Arum Road at night when they were struck.

Paramedics tried to save Otterbeck, but he died at the scene.The driver, Darrel Kevin Fouter, 28, who lived nearby, was arrested and immediately taken to have his blood tested for alcohol.Otterbeck&rsquo;s family recently visited the country to see some of the project sites he worked on. They wanted to determine where the money raised in his memory might best be spent.Strauss said the first project was to complete a new roof for the school where he worked.The second was to build a first-aid medical clinic next to a school run by the foundation in a more rural settlement outside Cape Town."Hopefully, more funds could be raised to build a new school for local children," said Aksel&rsquo;s father, Jesper.Thanks to the generosity of his family, over R125 000 had already been raised&nbsp;online.Fouter, out on R5 000 bail, would be back in the Cape Town Magistrate&rsquo;s Court on May 9 to face charges of culpable homicide, reckless or negligent driving, and driving under the influence of alcohol.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
