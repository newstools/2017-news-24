Ntlemeza applied for leave to appeal against the Sibiya judgment.In his ruling in the Sibiya appeal, Matojane found that Ntlemeza had withheld information from both the court and police watchdog the Independent Police Investigative Directorate.Matojane said armed with this information it could have enabled the court to make a proper assessment.He found that Ntlemeza lacked "integrity and honour".Slim prospectsOn Wednesday Dukada argued that even Nhleko knew about Matojane's judgment when he appointed him as head of the priority crimes unit.Advocate Carol Steinberg, arguing for HSF and FuL, said Ntlemeza was unsuitable for the job because the earlier findings by Matojane were never appealed despite Ntlemeza's lawyers arguing that Matojane's comments carried little weight.The appeal judges agreed.They said there were no reasonable prospects of the appeal being successful even if it was tried in other courts.They found that the prospects of success of the appeal were slim, and dismissed the leave to appeal with costs."Should he wish to petition the SCA [Supreme Court of Appeal] for further appeal process, they may do so but the effect of the enforcement order is that pending those appeal processes, Ntlemeza is not allowed to go back to office," said Dela. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
