Many believe that to live a fulfilling life, one must pursue their self-interests, even to the detriment of all."The party said that according to Christian teaching, the death of Jesus was an act of love by God."Thus, each Easter we must celebrate love, essentially defined as self-sacrifice and selflessness. The tribulations we face, capitalist greed, kleptocratic gluttony, is due to society that inculcated self-interest as the goal."The party asked all worshipers to pray for peace in Syria, stability in Sudan, and in other war-torn regions."We make prayer requests also for our country that like God did with Pharaoh's heart, may he also change Zuma's heart."It asked Christians to remember the Palestinians, who continued to live under Israel&rsquo;s brutal murderous apartheid regime.The EFF said 435 of its "fighters" donated blood to ensure live were saved over Easter.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
