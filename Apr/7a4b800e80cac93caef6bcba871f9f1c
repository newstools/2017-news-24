He was allegedly linked to an older faction which previously dominated the scene, and which is now being toppled by a newer faction. The newer faction was on Monday said to be headed to Johannesburg to take over clubs previously dominated by the older faction. A source with intimate knowledge of what is happening told News24 that four busloads of men travelled to Johannesburg on Monday morning, intent on taking over security operations at the majority of clubs in the centre of the city.This after they took over security at several clubs in the Cape Town city centre and Table View. The same figures involved in the club security industry are also operators in the illicit cigarette trade.According to sources, a cigarette delivery truck was recently hijacked in Woodstock.They say the businessman now said to be on the run was meant to pay for the stolen loot but either did not pay at all or only paid a fraction of what he was meant to.Eyssen was therefore, according to sources, killed so that he would no longer have to be paid.They say his murder has sparked anger within the illicit cigarette trade and more violence is expected.WarningEyssen was recently released from jail.In 2007 he was convicted of racketeering in a case that marked the first time the Prevention of Organised Crime Act was used to convict anyone for membership of a criminal gang.Eyssen was a member of a housebreaking syndicate that targeted wealthy homes.Sources say he was linked to the older faction now&nbsp;being ousted from the club security scene.The tussle over dominating club security started about a week ago at an auction of two properties in the northern suburbs belonging to businessman Nafiz Modack, who was previously linked to an alleged scam involving luxury cars.He is apparently the ringleader of the new group which has taken on the old group.A massive brawl broke out at&nbsp;Modack's&nbsp;second property on auction&nbsp;in Parow last Wednesday.Controversial businessmen, including Mark Lifman and Andre Naude, who previously ran a nightclub security operation which was shut down as it was not registered as required by law, were present when the altercation took place.This, particularly Lifman's presence, angered Modack."I did warn them u wana take wats mine il take wats yours 2nyt an I dun just that , im no gangster im a businessman and only fear god &nbsp;no one else [sic]," &nbsp;Modack had said.He&nbsp;has told News24&nbsp;that clubs are being taken over to ensure the safety of patrons and to clamp down on the drug trade.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
