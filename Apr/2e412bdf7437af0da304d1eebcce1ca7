Our profession is floundering in the interim."Strous asked that Motsoaledi act decisively while he still can, as the lack of funding meant thousands were being denied treatment, especially children.He said he&nbsp;will write to the HPCSA in the interim to suggest new guidelines to the scope of practice.'I have to turn kids away'An education psychologist who runs her own practice in Woodstock, Cape Town, told News24 last year she has had to turn children living with conditions like dyslexia away over the funding crisis.- Read more: Children stranded as medical aids refuse funds for educational psychologists"It's been extremely stressful. I've been submitting to government medical aids and all the other funds for four years now and have never had a problem," she said, asking to remain anonymous.She said she made a loss of around R40 000 for work she had already done in May and June of 2016.A 64-year-old educational psychologist with 36 years' experience in Port Elizabeth, Gerhardt Goosen, told News24 that he has lost 70% of his livelihood, and fears for the lives of some of his more troubled patients."It's drastic. My practice itself, about 70% of it is gone. I'm seriously thinking of closing it and retiring. I'm 64, so it will be hard to find another job."He also said he received no notification of the change.The&nbsp;HPCSA&nbsp;told News24 at the time that it is was aware of the current challenges, but that the change in scope was motivated by inadequate regulations.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
