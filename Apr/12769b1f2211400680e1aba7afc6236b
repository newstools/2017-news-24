Chairperson of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Transport Dikeledi Magadzi has expressed concerns that the nationwide bus strike will inconvenience the country in proportions not witnessed before, particularly before the Easter weekend. Jump to bottom Bus strike in aid of all commuters&nbsp;Every bus commuter stranded on Wednesday as a result of the national transport strike should bear in mind one important fact: this strike is in aid of the commuting public almost as much as it is in support of the drivers. The drivers do want better pay and this, of course, does not directly involve commuters. But the drivers in this case are also demanding conditions that will improve safety - and that is of direct concern not only to every bus commuter, but to every road user.&nbsp;As matters stand, the bus companies at a local level are trying to enforce a split shift system to cater for the morning and evening rush hours. They propose that drivers, who may spend an hour or more getting to and from work, drive their buses for three hours in the morning rush. They are then supposed to take an eight-hour break before completing another five hours of driving to complete an eight-hour day. &nbsp;Just a reminder that our red buses in Joburg are not running because of the nationwide bus-driver strike.

Bus drivers stepped on the brakes on Wednesday, leaving thousands of commuters stranded. Services affected included MyCiti, Golden Arrow, and long-distance services such as Greyhound. Magadzi raised concerns about the timing of the strike, three days ahead the Easter weekend. "The national bus strike is set to inconvenience the country in proportions not witnessed before. A lot of people around this time are commuting by road to be with families. The stakes are high and all assistance, particularly from law enforcement agencies, is required so that the safety of road users is not compromised."&nbsp;#BusStrike - #EmployerAssociation frustrated with negotiation process, says laborers don&#39;t want to engage constructively #sabcnewsMore than 40 GNT buses in Phalaborwa are not working today, taxis are busy transporting commuters to their different destinations #BusStrike pic.twitter.com/8Mob8zBy8iAccording to the Cape Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, nearly 300 000 people in Cape Town use buses every working day and the impact of a prolonged strike would be felt throughout the city.&nbsp;President of the Cape Chamber Janine Myburgh has appealed to employers to be understanding during this time and urged motorists to start lift clubs.&nbsp;#BusStrike - According to the Bargaining Council in JHB, the gap between demands and offer is hampering the negotiation process #sabcnewsSome progress, as employers reach out to striking bus drivers.&nbsp;#Busstrike Employers have asked 2 meet with trade unions this afternoon at 2pm at the Bargaining Council to negotiate.@eNCA .@Radio702Buscor buses operate normally in Mbombela#busstrike#mpumalanganewshttps://t.co/FHaxQGPMeJ pic.twitter.com/WMnRHmYETgImpact of #BusStrike will be felt throughout the City with nearly 300k people relying on buses for transport https://t.co/V1gCP069sp pic.twitter.com/JvavoV1vA7Intercape not affected by the national strike.&nbsp;pic.twitter.com/MHT5AakwdPOver 60 SATAWU members in Phalaborwa who work for Great North Transport engaged in the #BusStrike outside GNT depot in Namakgale. pic.twitter.com/fL00ajW95Z@africangeekgirl The Gautrain Bus service is suspended until further notice due to the nationwide strike over wages.

Senior Cape Town traffic officer Richard Coleman told News24 that peak hour on Wednesday morning hadn't been much different than normal. It appeared most motorists had travelled to work earlier in anticipation of extra traffic. The dedicated bus and taxi lanes, however, showed that more taxis were operating, he said. Golden Arrow Bus Services, MyCiTi, Go George and Putco bus operations were among the services suspended as staff joined a national strike after wage negotiations deadlocked. Golden Arrow said unions that were party to the SA Road Passenger Bargaining Council on Monday gave notice of their intention to strike.&nbsp;#CapeTown&nbsp;#busstrike striking workers now making their way to the bargaining council @GroundUp_News pic.twitter.com/wylcgLlWiFCommuters in East London are fuming saying their long distance travelling plans have been compromised by the nationwide #busstrike #sabcnewsSTATEMENT by Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Transport Bus strike of serious concern to Portfolio Committee The chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Transport, Ms Dikeledi Magadzi, said she was concerned about the bus strike, just days before the Easter weekend. The national bus strike is set to inconvenience the country in proportions not witnessed before. A lot of people around this time are commuting by road to be with families. The stakes are high and all assistance, particularly from law enforcement agencies, is required so that the safety of road users is not compromised, Ms Magadzi said. The taxi industry, long- and short-distance, will be under a lot of pressure. Hence drivers should exercise caution and at all times stick to the rules of no overloading and no speeding, she said. She called on law enforcement to be strict when policing permits and licences, as the bus strike could potentially be exploited by unscrupulous operators who will find it convenient to transport long-distance travellers in unroadworthy and uncertified vehicles. The national bus strike started on Wednesday, April 12, and will last indefinitely, following disagreements between the bus driver unions and bus companies, under the umbrella of National Employers Association. Ms Magadzi wished all people travelling on the roads a safe Easter weekend and said she hoped participants at the bargaining council will explore all possible avenues to limit the impact of the strike. Road fatalities in our country are unbelievably high and that should not continue, she said.
