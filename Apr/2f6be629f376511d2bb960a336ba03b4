Ex Colonel Sakkie Louwrens of HPG said the Zimbabwean police shot dead two crocodiles on the banks of the Limpopo River on Thursday.&ldquo;We found what could possibly be human remains in them.&rdquo;The remains will be sent for DNA testing to see if it&rsquo;s Van Zyl&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Until we have the results, we can confirm nothing.&rdquo; A statement by the search companies said that they did &ldquo;everything possible to find Van Zyl and to establish what exactly had taken place&rdquo;.Several helicopters were used to try to find Van Zyl in the dense bush while trackers also searched a huge area.
