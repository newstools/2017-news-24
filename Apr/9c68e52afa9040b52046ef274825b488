On Friday, Fitch Ratings followed suit.Fitch downgraded South Africa&rsquo;s long-term foreign currency debt and long-term local currency debt to BB+, or "junk status", with a "stable outlook".Maynier said it was not good enough for the minister to simply concede that the ratings downgrade was a setback."The minister needs to roll up his sleeves and get into the fight to avoid further ratings downgrades. The minister&rsquo;s number one priority should be to avoid the nightmare scenario where massive forced selling of our debt triggers an economic meltdown that will spare nobody, rich or poor."&nbsp; Maynier said that to re-establish trust with the ratings agency, the minister, who was sworn in on Friday, March 31, had to show that he was serious about avoiding further downgrades.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
