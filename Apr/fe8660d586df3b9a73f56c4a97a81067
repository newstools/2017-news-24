ReporterWASTE management company EnviroServ has sponsored learnerships for 17 unemployed Nelson Mandela Bay youths to complete a Business Administration Learnership.The learnership programme started in late 2015 with 55 learners from other parts of the country. Of this number, 46 graduates were employed by EnviroServ divisions on fixed term contracts. Because of the success of the programme, EnviroServ committed to expanding it to Port Elizabeth for the first time, said Neville Moopanar, EnviroServ Group Training Manager.After consultation with the local ward counsellors, 17 men and women aged 18 to 35, two of whom are differently abled, were selected from Motherwell and Wells Estate. EnviroServ will pay all their tuition costs for the year of around R45 000 each. Part of our skills development strategy is to provide learnerships for employees but also unemployed people in the communities in which we operate. This is one of the ways in which we give back. Moopanar said learnerships were key to addressing scarce and critical skills within the sector and industry. The 12-month Business Administration level two learnership is a national certificate through the South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) and consists of three months theory and nine months of practical training. We aim to equip learners with both theore-tical and workplace learning interventions, that lead to occupationally based qualifications that are registered with SAQA, explained Moopanar. It is important to create a pool of suitable, qualified people with the right skill and knowledge. Employees are a business greatest asset and key differentiator. Price, processes and systems can be copied but skilled and experienced staff are invaluable. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
