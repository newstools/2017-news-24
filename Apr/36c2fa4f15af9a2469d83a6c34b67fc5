Let us not allow our children to be robbed of their future because of matters which must be solved outside the classroom."Earlier this month, a school administration block was burnt down, four days after fresh violence erupted in Vuwani over the boundary dispute. The Tshirhunzanani Primary School in Vuwani&rsquo;s Vyeboom section was torched days after the demarcation board rejected the community's appeal to review its decision. Further protests were thwarted by police. The ANC's provincial executive committee (PEC) had established a task team to specifically work on the Vuwani issue,&nbsp;Seabi said. "This is the team which has been working around the clock during the Easter holiday in order to save the future of our children who must be allowed to go to school and learn.&nbsp;"The ANC shall continue to engage with all stakeholders, including traditional leaders,&nbsp;civic structures and religious leaders in order to find a lasting peaceful solution in Vuwani," Seabi added.The ANC&nbsp;said, while it respected the right of society to challenge decisions of any institution, "we do not support hooliganism, intimidation, violence, &nbsp;destruction of property and the targeting of schools in community protests".Community leaders were reported to be meeting on Monday to discuss a plan of action.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
