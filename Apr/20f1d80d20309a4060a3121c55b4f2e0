This after Ntlemeza told City Press that he would be reporting for duty on Tuesday.However, the Democratic Alliance has objected to this."This cannot be allowed, and [acting Hawks head Yolisa Matakata] must ensure that Ntlemeza is barred entry into the building if he tries such a stunt. The important work of the Hawks cannot be curtailed further by any unlawful actions by Ntlemeza," DA's Zakhele Mbhele said.&nbsp;City Press reported that Ntlemeza was insisting that he was still in charge of the Hawks and that he would turn up for work on Tuesday, in defiance of Mbalula&rsquo;s letter instructing him to "vacate the office".&nbsp; On Wednesday, the High Court in Pretoria dismissed Ntlemeza&rsquo;s application for leave to appeal its March judgment, with costs.It ordered him to vacate his office immediately. Former police minister Nathi Nhleko had also brought an appeal, which new Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has since withdrawn. Mbalula swiftly announced that Matakata would be taking over from Ntlemeza. Mbalula warned that he would ensure that the law was upheld, should Ntlemeza report for duty.&nbsp; "I'm implementing the court decision. He [Ntlemeza] says he is coming by force. It's fine, we will see him there and the law will be executed." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
