Worried about all the dairy + cauliflower = wind for babies?? [sic]"Noakes advised her to wean her child onto LCHF foods, which he described as "real" foods.His tweet read: "Baby doesn't eat the dairy and cauliflower. Just very healthy high-fat breast milk. Key is to ween [sic] baby onto LCHF."The HSPCA incorrectly released a statement in October in which it said it found Noakes guilty of unprofessional conduct. It quickly retracted the statement and apologised.Noakes&rsquo;s lawyer, Michael van der Nest, had argued that in the present case there was not a shred of evidence to show that anybody had been harmed. Noakes had no doctor/patient relationship with Leenstra and had not given her medical advice. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
