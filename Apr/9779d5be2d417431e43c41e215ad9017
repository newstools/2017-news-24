He had apparently been due to fly back to Spain on Thursday night.That day, he sent a message to his ex-wife, Julia Engelhorn, asking her to come over for lunch, said Adonis.He said that when she arrived, he told her he had killed the twins."She got up, went into the bedroom and discovered the twins. The third child was still at school. He had a knife in his possession.
