At 06:24, he sent investigating officer message, saying he will be in Bela Bela, later at 11:06, he said: 'I will be proceeding to Johannesburg,'" said Mudau.However, it turned out that he had travelled between to Senwabarana and Johannesburg, which is about 300km from Polokwane."It will be very difficult for the court to know that if we are dealing with an honest person, or a person playing games with this court," said Mudau."I am not an expert or a psychologist. All the scheduled appointments did not happen because the accused was traveling.""Mr Patel is not honest with this court," added Mudau.However, the State agreed that Patel should be evaluated mentally."If he should be assessed, it should be done while he is custody. There won't be interruption and will be sure that he will be available," said Mudau.The matter continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
