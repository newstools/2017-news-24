One winter of average rainfall will not get us out of this predicament,&rdquo; mayoral committee member for informal settlements, water and waste services; and energy, Xanthea Limberg, said.&ldquo;To give our residents an idea of the seriousness of the situation, we will be lowering the consumption target to 600 million litres soon.&rdquo;In March, mayor Patricia de Lille declared the city a disaster zone to accelerate the development of emergency water schemes.
