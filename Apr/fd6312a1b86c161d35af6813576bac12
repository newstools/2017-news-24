Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson is slated to provide more details at a news conference on Sunday morning.The alleged incident occurred in mid-March. Guglielmi has said police were not aware of the attack until the girl's mother approached Johnson as he was leaving a police station on the city's West Side and showed him the video.Guglielmi said Johnson was "visibly upset" after he watched, both by the video's content and the fact that there were "40 or so live viewers and no one thought to call authorities".Police have said the attack involved five or six males.The girl's mother told The Associated Press last month that her daughter received online threats following the attack. The Chicago Sun-Times later reported that the girl's family had been relocated.The video marks the second time in recent months that Chicago police have investigated an apparent attack that was broadcast live on Facebook.In January, four people were arrested after video showed them allegedly taunting and beating a mentally disabled man. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
