He confirmed that their last meeting with organisers had been on Wednesday.Mahamba said that Save SA had initially said they would submit outstanding documents by 09:00 on Thursday, but police officials had given them the whole day to submit."We have complied with the requirements," said Heywood who condemned rumours that the group had not received the necessary go-ahead to march on Friday.In his capacity as a Save SA social justice activist, he said: "We have been meeting with senior police officials all week on details and arrangements, in very productive and cordial meetings, and merely need to finalise a few minor administrative issues this morning such as bus routes to and from the demonstration.""The only document outstanding so far is a response from the Presidency, so we are waiting for that," he explained.'Peaceful march'Heywood said that because the Union Buildings are a national key point, a letter had to be written to the Presidency stating that a march was planned.Heywood said that the march was legal and complied with the Regulation of Gatherings Act, and that people would be exercising their right to protest peacefully in what they have started referring to as "The People's March".He said that it would be unlawful for authorities to stop it.The demonstration is planned to take place on Friday from 10:00 at Church Square, after which demonstrators will march to the Union Buildings at 12:00.Heywood assured South Africans that the march would be peaceful and that nobody should feel afraid to join. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
