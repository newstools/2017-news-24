At this stage it was impossible to identify &ldquo;who did what&rdquo; and any action would have to take place after the meeting with the league leadership."They need to go to the polls"Meanwhile, the head of the Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans&rsquo; Association (MKMVA) in KwaZulu-Natal, Themba Mavundla, has backtracked on a statement that its members would not accept a vote of no confidence in the head of state in the National Assembly. Asked yesterday if it still stood by the position with the vote being postponed, Mavundla said: &ldquo;The issue is not one of accepting the outcome of the vote or not."The issue is that MPs who are deployed by the ANC to Parliament have to abide by its resolutions. They are the representatives of the ANC. What they need to do is that which the ANC instructs them to do.&rdquo;&ldquo;Something in Parliament won&rsquo;t change that ... they need to go to the polls [to recall the president],&rdquo; he said.Mavundla said he was &ldquo;very satisfied&rsquo;&rsquo; with the conduct of the 600 combat-ready MKMVA members sent to defend Luthuli House during the protest march against the president in Johannesburg.MKMVA members had &ldquo;rescued&rdquo; DA members who had gone to Luthuli and &ldquo;found themselves face to face with the youth league&rdquo;.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you, if we had not been there, those guys would have been history,&rdquo; Mavundla said. He said the camouflaged MKMVA members had also intervened in clashes between the police and the youth league who were &ldquo;all over each other&rdquo;.&ldquo;We brought about tranquillity. I am happy with the decision we took to go there,&rdquo; Mavundla, the head of the KwaZulu-Natal department of public safety, said.Mavundla has repeatedly declined to discuss the apparent contraction between his role as a civil servant and heading the former liberation military structure at the same time.He said the MKMVA members at Luthuli House were either veterans of the underground forces or Self Defence Unit members trained in the townships in 1992 and 1993.&ldquo;They are younger than me, yes, but they were trained,&rdquo; he said.TALK TO USDo you think the ANC Youth League owes the organisers of the Kathrada memorial an apology?SMS us on 35697 using the keyword YOUTH and tell us what you think.
