He died a little while later. We have opened an inquest to determine the circumstances of the death, but the community thinks there is no justice for the child, hence the protests."Maybe they should have consulted with us before protesting as we are investigating the matter," said Mokgwabone. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
