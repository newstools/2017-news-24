Food drops in one area of Jonglei have been suspended as a result of the fighting, the UN said."The guns have to fall silent ... (or) the humanitarian situation will continue to deteriorate," said Eugene Owusu, the top UN humanitarian official in South Sudan at a press conference on Wednesday in the capital of Juba.Famine was declared in two counties of South Sudan this February, but aid workers have repeatedly been blocked from delivering food aid by government and rebel forces.In Jonglei, aid organizations are also fighting what the UN calls the longest running outbreak of cholera since South Sudan became an independent nation in July 2011.South Sudan's Ministry of Health has recorded 5 995 cases of cholera, and 146 deaths due to the disease.The cholera outbreak will "intensify and spread during the upcoming rainy season due to continued conflict," the UN humanitarian report on Thursday said.Roughly 3.5 million people have been displaced due to South Sudan's civil war, according to the UN, and close to 1 million people have fled to Uganda. Roughly 1 million people in South Sudan are on the brink of starvation, said the report.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
