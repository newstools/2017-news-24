They know that what you do every day in your life, you do it in pursuit of building a non-racial and non-sexist South Africa."Stay firm, stay focused on the strategic objective... [leading] our people. Do not look around and listen to the noise, because that noise will dwindle day by day, week by week, month by month and every year because the masses of our people are behind you."Mahumapelo urged all the churches and their religious leaders around the country to pray for "those who want to bring disorder to this country"."We must pray for them because what they are doing is not good for our country, we must ask God, the almighty, he must remove them from the ways that seeks to destroy our country and put them on a path that puts us together," he said.Several political parties and civil society organisation recently marched against Zuma, calling him to vacate his office.Many reminded Zuma of the Nkandla judgment which found that he violated his oath of office.The country was also outraged and caught by surprise by Zuma's dramatic Cabinet reshuffle which saw the axing of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas.The country was downgraded to junk status by two ratings agencies following the move.WATCH:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
