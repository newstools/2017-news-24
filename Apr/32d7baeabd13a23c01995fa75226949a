Run away from corruption and state capture! Run for the lives of those who have poor education, no toilets, no safety, collapsing healthcare, no proper schools! Run for your life and theirs," Save SA said.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
