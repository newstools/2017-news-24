We just manage the students' residences,'' said South Point.Students say it costs between R28 000 and R30 000 for the 10 months of the academic year.Katiyo said the head lease arrangement arose from a student accommodation crisis across the country, not just in Cape Town, and the residences were kitted out according to minimum specifications set out by the Minister of Higher Education Blade Nzimande.Each unit in the residences must have a certain number of appliances and level of facilities per number of students.RulesHowever, the refurbishment of the front block at the New Market Junction in Woodstock was only completed in 2016 to accommodate another 250 students, and facilities are still receiving all their equipment.''I don't know how many microwaves there are, but I can tell you it is not one [as the students say],'' said Katiyo.He added that the rules of the residences were not set by South Point, but by CPUT, and if there was any infraction, CPUT was informed, and dealt with it.There were different levels of offences, and offences that spark evictions are related to crime, such as having drugs, or having a firearm on the premises.He added that there was also an element of squatting at the beginning of every student year by students who had failed, so the rules are that friends can visit at certain times, but not stay overnight.Comment from CPUT was not immediately available.WATCH:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
