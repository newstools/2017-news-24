Interior security cabinet secretary Joseph Nkaissery said on Monday a gun has been recovered and is being examined to see if it was used to shoot Gallmann in the stomach. The Italian-born Gallmann was shot on Sunday while patrolling her ranch, which recently was targeted by arsonists. She is reported to be in stable condition. The local farmers' association says suspicion has fallen on herders who have invaded Gallmann's ranch several times. Nkaissery blames the shooting on "isolated banditry activity." Kenya's drought affects roughly half the country. More than 30 people have died in conflicts over grazing land as herders try to save their animals. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
