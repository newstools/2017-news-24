We should agree that the politics leads the gun&hellip;" Mugabe was quoted as saying.Widespread reports have indicated that the long-standing leader has frosty relations with war veterans following a leaked confidential ministerial document which had revealed that Mugabe could be in trouble after the war veterans declared that they no longer wanted him to lead the southern African country.The war veterans, who called Mugabe "a genocidal dictator", issued a damning communiqu&eacute; sometime in 2016, declaring that they would not support Mugabe's candidature in the 2018 national elections.They argued that the president's candidacy was going to be a hard sell because of his advanced age.But Mugabe's wife Grace declared recently that Zimbabweans would vote for Mugabe's "corpse" if it were on a ballot.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
