She was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and released on R30 000 bail.In December, she was rearrested for breaking her bail conditions, which included that she not contact Austin directly or indirectly.Booth said it was social worker Anne Cawood&rsquo;s opinion that it was emotionally traumatic for her four-year-old to be separated from her.Her 16-year-old was essentially looking after the younger child because Austin could not cope alone.&ldquo;The children are being punished before the mother has been found guilty. For five months now they have been separated.&rdquo;Austin&rsquo;s request to prosecuting authorities that she return home strengthened their application, he said.Magistrate Goolam Bawa asked if it was possible for the younger child to join his mother.Booth said it was important that the child remain in an environment where he felt secure and contained.&ldquo;The youngster has grown up in that home. The play school is three minutes away.&rdquo;The State opposed the application on the basis that she might interfere or unduly influence her husband as a witness.With the investigation complete, the matter would soon be transferred to the Western Cape High Court.Bawa would pass judgment on the application on May 4.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
