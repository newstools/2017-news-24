He said that if Chonco was booked off sick in March, he should have informed the disciplinary officials.In postponing proceedings for the day, Khuzwayo said that the disciplinary would continue on Tuesday with or without Chonco.In her 2014 report, former public protector Advocate Thuli Madonsela found that Zuma and his family unduly benefitted from R246m in upgrades to his Nkandla homestead.Zuma refuted the report and the matter was taken to the Constitutional Court.In its judgment on March 31, the Constitutional Court ordered Treasury to determine the "reasonable amount" Zuma should repay.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
