South Africaâ€™s oldest ocean sailing race - the Vasco Da Gama will see the third and last (for now) running of the race from Durban to Port Elizabeth. It starts today in Durban at midday. The straight line distance for this 46th edition of the race is 400 nautical miles (740 kilometres), which can increase somewhat if the wind is against the yachts sailing down the coast. The course for 2018 has yet to be announced. The Durban to PE race record is 2 days 6 hours 58 minutes and 2 seconds. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
