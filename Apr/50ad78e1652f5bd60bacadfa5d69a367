President Zuma acted out of self interest when he single-handedly fired capable and trusted Treasury leadership and replaced them with servants of corruption. Doing this at a time when our country was teetering at the brink of both junk status and recession, is the final straw."It called on the memory of former President Nelson Mandela and struggle stalwart Ahmed Kathrada to prevail."The president must be held accountable for abusing the trust placed in him by you and by the citizens of South Africa. Party loyalty is important, but we are in a dire situation, and the Constitution and the citizens of South African must take precedence before it is too late."Several protests were organised internationally in solidarity with the anti-Zuma protests in South Africa on Friday, where thousands of people took to the streets.The marches follow Zuma's recent cabinet reshuffle, which included the firing of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas.The country has since been downgraded to junk status by two investment ratings agencies.Parliament will debate a motion of no confidence in Zuma on April 18.Large #ZumaMustFall protest here in London.
