Numsa said the intervention of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration had not addressed the union's grievances and it resolved to call a strike.Autopax, which Mahlabana previously told News24 is not a member of employer associations involved in the bargaining council negotiations, had only been notified of the strike on Tuesday.&nbsp; Mahlabana said Autopax is a non-party in the matter, as it is not a member of any employer associations involved.&nbsp; Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi however said it had not yet signed any agreements.&ldquo;We only negotiate through the Bargaining Council, and we wish to reiterate that it is Numsa policy that only the General Secretary can sign agreements on behalf of the union,&rdquo; she said.The union would on Friday meet with the Minister of Labour Mildred Oliphant as well as employers to try and resolve the dispute, Hlubi added.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
