It could have come through the roof or the drains, we have a lot of bush behind the shops, and there are snakes there."She said the snake was freed from the fridge and was now under observation and would be released into the nearby Kruger National Park."When a snake ends up in the fridge, its organs start shutting down and it could take up to 48 hours for it to be back to normal," she said. - Read more: Women wrestle 4m python off dogInstead of driving customers away, the snake seems to have attracted the curious, who want to make sure that the "poor" snake had not been harmed."The last thing we would do is hurt the poor python," she said, calling on people not to panic.
