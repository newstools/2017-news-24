International ratings agencies have downgraded South Africa and this will lead to high interest rates levied on home, car and student loans, to high food prices and to a bigger fiscal debt.- Zuma used an unsubstantiated and bogus intelligence report to remove a competent minister and deputy minister of finance, and replace them with under-experienced yes-men. This means he uses state security agencies to fight political battles.- Zuma&rsquo;s Cabinet reshuffle was not in the best interests of the country in that it protected and rewarded incompetent ministers who have thrown state institutions into disarray like Faith Muthambi (SABC) and Bathabile Dlamini (social grants).- The Constitutional Court found that Jacob Zuma acted illegally, unlawfully and failed to uphold, defend and respect the Constitution in that he disregarded the public protector&rsquo;s remedial action on the Nkandla corruption. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
