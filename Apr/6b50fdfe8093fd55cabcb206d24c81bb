Hichilema has launched several unsuccessful legal bids to challenge Lungu's victory in last August's election, and has said he does not recognise Lungu's presidency.He claims the vote was rigged and accuses Lungu of unleashing an unprecedented wave of political repression in the southern African country, which is known for its relative stability in the region.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
