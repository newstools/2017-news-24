The first batch of 68 troops left the country on Monday, while the other two batches would follow later.Dickinson extended his appreciation to the Japanese soldiers for the role they had played in the east Africa country. "Some contingents of Japanese troops will begin their pullout [on] Monday, the rest will systematically follow.

Reports last month indicated that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that Japan would not renew the mission after the current rotation was complete.
