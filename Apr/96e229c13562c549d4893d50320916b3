The remains were exhumed in the presence of police, military and family members of the victims," the source said, adding forensic tests would be carried out in the coming weeks. Jammeh defied international calls for investigation into the circumstances leading to the men's deaths following the coup attempt and the authorities declined requests to hand over their remains to their families for burial.Six other men were convicted and sentenced by a military court in April 2015 in connection with the attempted power grab, with three given death sentences. President Adama Barrow, who defeated Jammeh in the polls in December to oust him from power after 22 years, pardoned the convicted coup plotters last month and reintegrated them into the army.Jammeh fended off several attempted coups after coming to power in 1994 via the same method, and is now living in exile in Equatorial Guinea.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
