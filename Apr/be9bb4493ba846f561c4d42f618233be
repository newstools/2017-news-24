Actress Bette Midler tweeted: &ldquo;#MikePence won&rsquo;t dine with a woman without his wife b/c he doesn&rsquo;t trust himself or b/c he thinks his wife will run away while he&rsquo;s out?&rdquo;This was part of a Washington Post story published last week, which also described his wife Karen as his &ldquo;prayer warrior, gut check and shield&rdquo;.&ldquo;In 2002, Mike Pence [said] he never eats alone with a woman other than his wife, and that he won&rsquo;t attend events featuring alcohol without her by his side,&rdquo; it revealed.It led some Twitter users to point to another forgotten profile piece about Pence from 15 years ago, in which it was revealed he calls his wife &ldquo;mother&rdquo;.The Rolling Stone story recounted a dinner at the then Indiana governor&rsquo;s mansion, which was attended by several politicians.&ldquo;Pence shouted to his wife, Karen, his closest adviser, at the other end of the table: &lsquo;Mother, mother, who prepared our meal this evening?&rsquo;&rdquo; the 2002 feature reads.&ldquo;The legislators looked at one another, speaking with their eyes. He just called his wife &lsquo;mother&rsquo;. Maybe it was a joke, [one] reasoned. But a few minutes later, Pence shouted again: &lsquo;Mother, mother, whose china are we eating on?&rsquo;&rdquo;All of this was too much for Twitter users, and a string of pointed messages were directed at Pence, who is President Donald Trump&rsquo;s staunchest ally.Rather than a sign of the strength of their marriage, many concluded that Pence&rsquo;s stance on not being alone with women was &ldquo;creepy&rdquo; and even troubling.&ldquo;Mike Pence refusing to dine with women alone or drink at events without his wife present isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;respectful&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;don&rsquo;t trust me&rsquo;,&rdquo; Katy Volikas wrote.In defending the second most powerful man in the world, Pence&rsquo;s fans labelled his critics &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; for criticising his marriage.But as Twitter user Jessie Lahr pointed out, he is a steadfast opponent of gay marriage.&ldquo;Um ... judging other people&rsquo;s marriages is Pence&rsquo;s favourite extracurricular activity,&rdquo; she said. &ndash; News.com.au 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
