Rodriguez, chief of staff for a specially designated US military task force based in Djibouti, said piracy "certainly has increased" in recent weeks. But he said countering it is not a mission for his troops, who are focused on counterterrorism in the Horn of Africa and developing the capacities of national armies in Somalia and elsewhere in the region.Anti-piracy patrolling is among several missions China cited for constructing what it calls a naval logistics center in Djibouti. The base is under construction, and US officials say they don't see it as a major threat to interfere with American operations at Camp Lemonnier.Several other countries have a military presence on or near that US site, including France, Italy, Germany and Japan.This reflects Djibouti's strategic location at the nexus of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.Mattis made a point of spending several hours in Djibouti during a week long trip that has otherwise focused on the Mideast.As a measure of his concern for nurturing relations with the Djiboutian government, he flew four hours from Doha, Qatar, and then flew right back.At his news conference, Mattis praised Djibouti for having offered US access to Camp Lemonnier shortly after the September 11 attacks."They have been with us every day and every month and every year since," he said.The US rotates a range of forces through Lemonnier and flies drone aircraft from a separate airfield in the former French colony. US special operations commandos are based at Lemonnier for counterterrorism missions in Somalia and elsewhere in the region.During Mattis' visit, elements of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, including V-22 Osprey aircraft and Harrier attack jets were visible on Lemonnier's airfield.The US military presence has grown substantially in recent years, as reflected by construction of a new headquarters building, gym, enlisted barracks and other expanded infrastructure.Djibouti has a highly prized port on the Gulf of Aden. The country is sandwiched between Somalia and Eritrea, and also shares a border with Ethiopia.Mattis is using the early months as defense secretary to renew or strengthen relations with key defense allies and partners such as Djibouti, whose location makes it a strategic link in the network of overseas US military bases.Djibouti took on added importance to the US military after 9/11, in part as a means of tracking and intercepting al-Qaeda militants fleeing Afghanistan after the US invaded that country in October 2001.The US has a long-term agreement with Djibouti for hosting American forces; that pact was renewed in 2014.Over the past week Mattis has met with leaders in Saudi Arabia, Israel, Egypt and Qatar.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
