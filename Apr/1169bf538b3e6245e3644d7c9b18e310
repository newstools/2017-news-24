The Presidency is thus not opposed to the march by Save SA,&rdquo; it said in a statement.Acting police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane said on Thursday that anyone taking part in marches in Pretoria would be breaking the law. He said the organisers did not have permission.However, Save SA spokesperson Mark Heywood said earlier that a chief magistrate had in fact granted permission for the march.&ldquo;We had our lawyers file an urgent application with the chief magistrate, setting out our efforts to obtain permission. She considered the application and overturned the prohibition.&rdquo;Msimanga supports marchTshwane mayor Solly Msimanga welcomed the court&rsquo;s decision.&ldquo;This march has always had the support of the DA-led administration in the capital and we fully support the constitutional right for South Africans to protest in a manner that is commensurate with the law.&rdquo;He said someone was &ldquo;playing politics&rdquo; and using their administrative position to cause confusion. The SAPS and Tshwane metro police had been &ldquo;captured&rdquo; by ANC headquarters Luthuli House.Both bodies had a constitutional duty under the Gatherings Act to ensure a march posed no risk to life and limb.&ldquo;It must be made clear that there are many men and women in uniform who discharge their duty without fear, favour, or prejudice and for that we thank them. It is those who seek to play politics instead of keeping our people safe who will face swift and appropriate action in due course.&rdquo;Several marches and events are expected to take pace nationwide on Friday, following President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s Cabinet reshuffle last week. He appointed 10 new ministers and 10 new deputy ministers.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
