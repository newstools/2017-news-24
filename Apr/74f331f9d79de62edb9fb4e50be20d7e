The highest court in the land found that the parliamentary public participation process had been inadequate. It also found that provincial legislatures had been given less than two weeks to advertise and hold public hearings, consider oral and written submissions from the public, and provide negotiating and final mandates.The case was brought by the Land Access Movement of South Africa. The then 2014 act had reopened the lodging of land claims for five years, ending in 2019."The introduction of this draft bill is a crucial step in the work of the ANC in Parliament in ensuring that land is lawfully returned to those who have been historically dispossessed," Mhlauli said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
