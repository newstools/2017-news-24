However, we condemn the abuse of such freedom as done by Zapiro through his cartoon."We will continue to fight against the portrayal of women as objects," Matuba said.The league wanted Shapiro, aka Zapiro, to apologise to all women in SA and all rape survivors.Shapiro said the current climate in the country over state capture and the Cabinet reshuffle warranted his drawing the cartoon.Zapiro's cartoon @dailymaverick (11 April 2017) #StateCapture #Guptas #FakeNews #Cronies #StateOrgans - https://t.co/oY0QbdL4Bf pic.twitter.com/vxAWMpMDiv24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
