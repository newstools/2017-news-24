Jerome was named in a court case as the head of the Sexy Boys gang and as a suspect in Beeka's murder.Nothing ever came of that information and he was never arrested.Cronje, also involved with SPS, later fell out with his associates as he faced allegations of misappropriating company money, assault, and missing meetings.Months after its launch, SPS was shut down as it was not registered with the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority, as was required by law.Lifman and Naude faced more than 300 charges as a result, but were later acquitted of all the counts.It later emerged that just months after SPS collapsed, a new company apparently run by Van Zyl, who previously worked with the duo, had cropped up.It was named Lifestyle Entertainment Services.'I did warn them'The new company's existence, while apparently not linked to the incident, came into the spotlight following the murder of doorman Joe Kanyona at the popular Long Street pub, Beerhouse, in 2015.At the time, three suspects were arrested for conspiring to kill Kanyona.About three weeks ago, businessman Nafiz Modack is said to have started taking control of club security in Cape Town, and is said to also have his sights set on Johannesburg and Durban.Modack's name was previously linked to an alleged scam involving luxury cars.Sources told News24 that he is working with the brother of an alleged gang leader and a businessman from Pakistan, who they claim is involved in international organised crime and is financing the new group.When previously approached for comment by News24, Modack said via email: "I did warn them u wana take wats mine il take wats yours 2nyt an I dun just that, im no gangster im a businessman and only fear god no one else [sic]."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
