He was in a critical condition and connected to a respiratory device the entire time.Bleeding stoppedAfter undergoing both a MRI and a CT scan, his parents, Herman and Adri were told about two weeks ago that the doctors couldn&rsquo;t pick up any brain activity. Two of his neck vertebrae were damaged during the attack and doctors were unable to perform any operation because of swelling on his brain.Herman said shortly after the attack that there were numerous sutures on his only child&rsquo;s neck. The bite marks to his windpipe were attended to at the Lephalale Mediclinic where the bleeding to the back of his neck was also stopped before he was taken by helicopter to the Mediclinic Muelmed.Kristian was visiting his grandmother, Marie Strydom, who has lived in her own home on Cor and Alet Vos&rsquo;s luxury estate outside Lephalale the past five years when the three-year-old lion attacked him.Strydom, 75 and the Vos couple are friends. They have three &ldquo;tame&rdquo; lions who live in cages on the estate. Kristian&rsquo;s father Herman said the lion who attacked his son had appeared in her kitchen all of a sudden. She told Kristian to run to the bedroom, but before he could do that, the lion went for his throat.Strydom shoved the lion off Kristian, who was the apple of her eye. She protected Kristian from the lion by lying over the child. Kristian, who was a Grade 6 pupil at the Louis Leipoldt Laerskool in Centurion, regularly visited his grandma during school holidays.His parents and grandma stayed with him in the hospital and didn&rsquo;t leave his bedside.Support and prayersSince Kristian was admitted to hospital, a Facebook page has been created and Herman on Wednesday morning wrote, &ldquo;Kristian Josef Armand Prinsloo died at 10:50.
