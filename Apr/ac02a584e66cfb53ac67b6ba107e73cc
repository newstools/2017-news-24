Instead of compensating municipalities and ratepayers for the R 112bn loss that they incurred, this R 1.5bn trust has been&nbsp; set up to help the private sector diversify instead of bringing justice to the residents of those municipalities.&rdquo;She said this was why the city decided to pursue the matter independently instead of relying on national government for proper recourse. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
