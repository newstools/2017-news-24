I'm just focusing on kickboxing," he said.When approached for comment last week, Grant Veroni, listed on TSG's website as its chief executive officer, said he would return the call.He is yet to do so.Veroni did not answer his phone on Wednesday.An employee who answered a call at TSG's offices said: "I'm not allowed to give you information."TSG's Facebook page said it had a sister company, Skhosana Maponyane Hall Phillips and Khumalo, which offered "legal assistance, provincial and national liquor licence application, rescission of judgment, immigration, labour disputes and property rentals".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
