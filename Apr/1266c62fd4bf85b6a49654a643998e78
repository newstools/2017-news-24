It also carries the signatures of Naledi Pandor and Ngoako Ramatlhodi.The committee noted that Fransman had refused to attend his disciplinary hearing, which detracted from his duty to fix the negative perceptions created of the ANC.He persisted with the claim that the evidence of two of his witnesses was not considered, the NDCA document reads."To protect the image of the ANC", the NDCA decided to refer the matter back to the national disciplinary committee (NDC).This would allow Fransman to submit evidence for his claim that the NDC was biased against him, and that the witnesses bring their evidence to back up why his first misconduct charge should be reviewed and set aside.The NDC must convene the hearing in 21 days. Fransman, his representative and witnesses must make themselves available for the hearing.Accused of sexual assaultFransman's assistant Vanessa le Roux said his supporters were pleased with the development, and interpreted the decision as proof that the process against Fransman had been flawed and biased all along.Fransman was elected ANC provincial chairperson in 2015. In January 2016, Louisa Wynand accused him of sexual assault while they were driving to the ANC&rsquo;s birthday gathering in Rustenburg.He was asked to step aside, which he tried to resist through the courts. He was partially blamed for the party's relatively poor showing in the Western Cape in the August 2016 local government elections.On November 9, 2016 the party&rsquo;s NDC found him guilty of two counts of misconduct. His ANC membership was suspended for five years.He abused his office to try and obtain a sexual favour from Wynand, and for making public statements which brought the ANC into disrepute, the ANC said in a statement at the time.In December, Fransman applied to the NDCA. He also tried to get the Western Cape High Court to set aside the finding, but it was dismissed with costs.Fransman maintained his innocence and questioned the way his disciplinary inquiry was handled. He called his suspension a "soft coup".In her statement, Le Roux criticised sacked tourism minister and ANC veteran Derek Hanekom and the party's secretary general Gwede Mantashe, for their handling of the matter.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
