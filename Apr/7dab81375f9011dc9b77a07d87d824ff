	     London - A British nurse who contracted Ebola while working in Sierra Leone hopes to return to the West African country next month. Pauline Cafferkey told BBC she plans a fundraising trip to Sierra Leone, and says she hopes the trip will bring her "closure" after an extremely difficult experience. The trip is being organised to raise money for Street Child, a British charity helping young people affected by the epidemic. The 41-year-old Cafferkey was hospitalised in a specialty unit shortly after she returned to Britain from West Africa at the end of 2014. She has been hospitalised several times since then with complications linked to Ebola. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
