Samantha Lee @Samantha_Lee121 A new organisation aimed at dealing with the rape and violation of women and children has been established in Stacha Arendse s honour.The Mitchell s Plain Crisis Forum was established following her murder last month.Joanie Fredericks, the forum s coordinator, says they have designed the forum in a way that they can be accessible to the entire Mitchell s Plain. We have a permanent venue in Eastridge for daytime meetings but at night we are rotating venues, says Fredericks.The forum is focused on action. The purpose is clear and simple: To end the rape and killings of children in Mitchell s Plain. We are not going to stand by and allow it anymore. The organisation is in its infancy, but they are planning to tackle the issue head-on.They will be starting with a show of support at Wynberg court for the hearing of the 50-year-old man accused of Rene Tracy Roman s murder. Then they will be at the Mitchell s Plain court on Wednesday 3 May for the bail hearing of the accused in Stacha s murder.Fredericks says her organisation is not a fly-by-night initiative. We are serious and we are going to become one of the most recognised organisations for activism against these rapes, she says. They look forward to working with other organisations in other areas to strengthen their voice. She adds they will also give special attention to the rape of young boys as it is very rarely highlighted.
