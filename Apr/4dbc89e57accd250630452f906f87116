He said he declared the sponsorship for the police golf club in 2011/12.Sharon Govender maintained she was not guilty of any criminal behaviour regarding gratifications or abusing her office.Prosecutor Billy Downer thanked the accused for admitting to a "large proportion of the payments".He believed it would dramatically shorten the trial.The trial continues. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
