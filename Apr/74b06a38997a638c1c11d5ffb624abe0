It can't be correct," said Phetoe."There are farmers who continue to kill workers, mistaken for baboons.. workers continue to be killed, mistaken for pigs," he said.Cosatu's Limpopo secretary Gerald Thwala said the ghost of racism still haunted South Africa. He presented at least four pending racism related cases, where victims had been "mistaken for animals" and shot.Thwala said some white farm owners escaped justice by claiming that police had tampered with investigations. Harmse said she would respond to the memorandum.Phetoe also used the march as an opportunity to campaign for Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to be elected as president during the upcoming ANC elective conference."Let's go to branch meetings and make sure that Cyril become the next president in December," he said.
