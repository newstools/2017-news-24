Nearly 37 000 have been rescued and brought to Italy.Smear campaign"We have evidence that there are direct contacts between certain NGOs and people traffickers in Libya," Zuccaro was quoted as saying by La Stampa."We do not yet know if and how we could use this evidence in court, but we are quite certain about what we say: Telephone calls from Libya to certain NGOs, lamps that illuminate the route to these organisations' boats, boats that suddenly turn off their [locating] transponders, are ascertained facts."Zuccaro is the head of a five-strong pool of prosecutors in charge of investigating all the legal aspects of the migrant crisis, from trafficking to illegal exploitation of migrant labour on Italian farms and rackets in the provision of reception facilities.La Stampa reported that prosecutors were looking into whether some of the newly-established NGOs involved in rescue operations may be financed by the traffickers themselves as a way of making it easier to guarantee their human cargoes would get to Italy.The organisations involved have all dismissed the charges against them and expressed concern that they are being targeted by an orchestrated smear campaign.One group, SOS Mediterranee, said last week it had "never, not once" been put in touch with a migrant boat via smugglers. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
