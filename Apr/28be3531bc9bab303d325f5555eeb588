Poverty and unbridled opulence live side by side."Sangoni said Freedom Day was also meant to assess the work that needed to be done to build national democratic society.&ldquo;We must at all times remain vigilant of certain sections of our population who were the beneficiaries of the old order and are bent on either reversing this achievement or at best stall the progress.&rdquo;&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
