These were:Bobani refused to go into the details of the cases, saying it was now up to police officials to investigate the matter.TensionsBobani said he had attended a mayoral committee meeting earlier on Wednesday and had sat down next to Trollip, who had then promptly adjourned the meeting."Maybe I am too ugly for him to see me, or I am stinking," he said.Bobani also accused Trollip of deliberately not inviting him to Monday's press conference on corruption and again accused Trollip of running the municipality like a farm."The racism is there. This man doesn't want to sort this matter out. There is racism there and as the UDM I am not going to let that happen," he said.Bobani also took a swipe at Trollip's chief of staff, Kristoff Adelbert."I must employ a chief of staff in my own office. He has a chief of staff who is a DJ; he is just a DJ, he doesn't have experience of government. I don't know if he thinks he is the municipal manager or the mayor," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
