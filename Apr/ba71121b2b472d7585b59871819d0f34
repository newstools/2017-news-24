He leaves on Thursday afternoon to Israel.No announcement is expected during the Egyptian leg of the tour, which started with a visit to Saudi Arabia. In Egypt, talks are likely to touch on the military's counterinsurgency in the Sinai Peninsula, where an Islamic State group affiliate has killed hundreds of soldiers and policemen.The Pentagon is also concerned with preventing jihadists from crossing Libya's porous border with Egypt and the reported presence of Russian troops in Egypt's western desert, which Cairo has denied.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
