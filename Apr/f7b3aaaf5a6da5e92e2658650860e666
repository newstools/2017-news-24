He says he has reported an ongoing problem of raw sewage flowing into the river for many years, but the problem does not stop.&ldquo;We are desperate to have this problem solved because there is no way we can keep on reporting the matter and it keeps recurring,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;I have sent the City of Cape Town photos of the faeces when it starts flowing into the canal and they do come out to make some &lsquo;repairs&rsquo; but a few days later the poo is flowing again.&ldquo;Apart from being a disgusting sight, the smell is terrible and it is a major health risk for all who live near the canal. In the past few months it has been so bad that we are all experiencing nausea and diarrhoea because of the constant smell.&rdquo;Danger to childrenMario&rsquo;s wife Elvina adds that her greatest concern is for children in the area who could play in the canal.&ldquo;I would like to know if the City regularly tests the water in this canal and monitors the situation,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Children are always attracted to canals like this one. What could happen if they started playing in this water?&ldquo;I have to keep an eye out when this happens and warn the children, but what if this sewage problem is happening in other areas further up the canal? &ldquo;This canal also flows into Zeekoevlei and I wonder how this situation is affecting that ecosystem.&rdquo;Foul stenchKeith Blake from Ottery also reports that he has noticed the foul stench in the air near Zeekoevlei.&ldquo;I have also written to the City with some of my concerns but as a regular fisherman there has also been a smell coming from the sea sometimes and I wonder if the flow of this sewage from Zeekoevlei is part of the problem.&ldquo;On Sunday after church I was driving through Pelican Park and that horrible smell was hanging in the air. I can&rsquo;t imagine how the residents in the area were coping with it.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
