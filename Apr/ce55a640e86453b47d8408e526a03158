He admitted that this was not always the case, as some in the NEC acted outside of what was expected of them."We elected you with confidence, but factory faults do occur," said Mbalula."Factory faults happen anywhere in any organisation, any factory, and the ANC has produced such over time. Don&rsquo;t bog me down as to who is a factory fault," said Mbalula when asked if Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane, who is also an NEC member, was one of those faults.Mokonyane had recently drawn criticism over comments following South Africa&rsquo;s economy being downgraded to junk status, after she said, at a rally in Germiston: "Let the Rand fall, we will pick it up."The ANC&rsquo;s policy documents propose that the party moves to significantly reducing the size of the NEC, and that only 65% of them should be allowed to take up Cabinet positions.Mbalula, focusing on the positive impact of openly expressing a desire to run for candidacy, said it would not undermine democratic processes, and that it would allow the party to know its leaders better."It&rsquo;s time now, given the explosion, to begin to allow people to express themselves, because it&rsquo;s going to be money exchanging hands and the richest ones will be in power," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
