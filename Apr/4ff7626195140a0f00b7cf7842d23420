"We wrote to the presidency two days ago requesting permission and have not even had our letter acknowledged. We sent that letter several times." Heywood said Save SA was told they also needed authorisation from the Chief Magistrate because of their proximity to the Palace of Justice. He however, said that this was a technicality because Save SA had been camped near the Palace of Justice for days. "We have been at Church Square in the proximity for days now. Why is this suddenly an issue?" Meanwhile Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga has since tweeted: "We haven't denied permission for tomorrow's march. Someone who's ill-disciplined is busy playing politics using their admin position."More to follow.- Make your voice heard. Are you marching or anywhere near a live protest?
