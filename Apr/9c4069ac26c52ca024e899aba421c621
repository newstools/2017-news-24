Francis is then due to give a speech in an international conference for peace organised by Al-Azhar, a seat of learning for 1 000 years as well as a celebrated mosque.John Paul II was the last pope to have visited Egypt in 2000, with his arrival also coming weeks after anti-Christian violence that killed about 20 Copts in January that year.Vatican dialogue with the Muslim world, a priority for this pope, was set back significantly when Francis's predecessor Benedict XVI made a speech in 2006 in which he was seen as linking Islam to violence.The now-retired German pontiff's 2011 comments condemning an attack on a Coptic church prompted Al-Azhar to denounce Benedict for meddling in Egypt's affairs.Francis will also meet on Friday with Tawadros II at his seat in Saint Mark's Cathedral before visiting the nearby Coptic church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, the target of the December bombing claimed by ISIS.The attack was the deadliest targeting the Coptic community since the 2011 suicide bombing that killed 23 people in Alexandria.&nbsp;'Second-class citizens'&nbsp;The pope will be joined at the international conference by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, Archbishop of Constantinople, the spiritual leader of the Orthodox world and a close ally.The Argentine will also meet with President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has been criticised internationally for human rights abuses but is seen as something of a friend to Egypt's Christian minority.In 2015, he became Egypt's first head of state to attend a Christmas mass.On Saturday, the pontiff will preside over a mass for the country's small Catholic community, estimated to number around 272 000 spread across various rites.Egypt's Copts, who make up about 10% of the country's population of 92 million, are the Middle East's largest Christian minority and one of the oldest.But they have suffered attacks throughout the years and many complain that they feel like second-class citizens.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
