But there are many ills, like drugs and gangsterism. I always told myself no matter what, I would never get involved in things like that," Adams said.His dream of being a rapper was dashed after his self-recorded demo about life in Zoar failed to sell, while his aspirations of wearing a police uniform sunk due to visible tattoos of his son&rsquo;s name on his arms."But this [programme] was the best thing that ever happened to me. I got to see things I would never have been exposed to in Zoar, although I missed my home very much," Adams admitted.During the three-month programme, Adams and the other participants were exposed to training in substance abuse, leadership, communication and diversity, as well as biodiversity and environmental awareness in an outdoor phase."I learnt so much, about myself and about life. But my favourite part of this was being out in nature, sleeping outside and hiking for long distances. It was tough, but I learnt about perseverance, which helped when I really missed home," he recalled.Being away from his family and three-year-old son was difficult, but he knew it was necessary so that he could grab the opportunities the programme would provide, Adams said.'I want a better future'Among the practical skills participants learn are electrical circuitry, firefighting, welding and cookery.Career discussions, volunteering at community projects and preparing to return home to their old lives are covered during the community phase of the course.It was here that Adams decided to never give up on his dream of wearing the blue uniform."I&rsquo;ve always wanted to work for the people of Zoar," he said."I decided that I would work hard to earn enough money to have my tattoos removed so that I can be accepted into the police academy. It&rsquo;s what I want &ndash; I don&rsquo;t want to give up on it."He hopes to use his internship as an opportunity for permanent employment should his dream of being a police officer not work out."I want to give my all in this opportunity. I want them to see my potential so that I can make my mother proud. When I saw my family crying of happiness at my graduation on Saturday, I realised how much this meant to me," he said."I have a son and I don&rsquo;t want him to grow up like me. I want him to have the stuff I didn&rsquo;t have. I want a better future. I will work hard for it."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
