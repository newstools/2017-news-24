I eat dry bread. I am needy. I can't take it any more. I'm fed up. We no longer have any alternative," Fathi Azlouk, an unemployed man in his 50s, told AFP.The measures announced by Chahed on Monday include opening up of petroleum companies' representations in the region, asphalting roads and a cabinet meeting in Tataouine next month.Six years after Tunisia's revolution sparked the Arab Spring, the country has yet to resolve problems such as poverty, unemployment and corruption that led to the ouster of dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
