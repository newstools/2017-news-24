We will build on this achievement, take lessons from the Easter weekend, and then move forward," said Transport and Community Safety MEC Nandi Ndalane.The MEC commended motorists and attributed the slight reduction of fatalities to their good behaviour."We appreciate the discipline displayed by the motorists, particularly those who were travelling on the major corridors, including N1, R101, R71, N11 and so on. What we have observed is that even though traffic was heavy and congested on these corridors, the behaviour of motorists was pleasing," said Ndalane."We think this had a positive spin on the reduction of fatalities we have achieved," said Ndalane.Awareness programmesEighteen pedestrians were killed, compared to 10 in 2016. Many of them were killed crossing village and township roads.The department has promised to improve its pedestrian safety education and awareness programmes.A total of 24 063 vehicles were stopped, 38 were discontinued, four minibus taxis were impounded, 10 buses were impounded and 32 drivers were arrested for drunk driving during operations by Limpopo traffic police over the Easter period."Drunk driving is a deliberate traffic violation which needs to be harshly dealt with. We cannot continue to tolerate these people who deliberately violate traffic law [and] contribute to the deaths on our roads," said Ndalane. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
