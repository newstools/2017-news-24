One of the bodies was decapitated.Four Congolese nationals who were accompanying them are still missing. Diplomats at the UN told AFP that the murdered pair had been investigating reports of mass graves.Last week, 39 police were killed in an ambush by rebels in Kasai.Bensouda's warning came just hours before the UN Security Council was to vote to cut by 3 600 the 20 000 troops in its peacekeeping mission in country.Bensouda called on all parties to "refrain from recurring to criminal violence" while calling on the Congolese government to bring the perpetrators to justice in the volatile central African country.The ICC, set up in 2002 to probe and prosecute the world's worst crimes, has been investigating war crimes and crimes against humanity in the DRC since June 2004.These investigations have led to the ICC's first two convictions.Warlord Thomas Lubanga was sentenced to 14 years for using children in his rebel army, while Germain Katanga was handed a 12-year sentence for an ethnic attack in 2003 on a village in the war-torn northeast Ituri province.A third trial, that of Bosco Ntaganda, is still ongoing.Ntaganda has denied 18 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. But prosecutors say he played a central role in the Ituri conflict which rights groups believe has left some 60 000 dead since 1999.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
