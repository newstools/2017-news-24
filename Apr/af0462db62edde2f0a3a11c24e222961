The agency is raising its projections for displacement from South Sudan and Somalia.Spokesperson Adrian Edwards cited a "particularly pernicious combination" of factors in the areas, pointing to the "world's biggest humanitarian crisis" in Yemen, conflicts in South Sudan and Somalia, and violence and instability caused by radical group Boko Haram in Nigeria and the Lake Chad basin.The UN's agency said seven million people in northern Nigeria are struggling with food insecurity.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
