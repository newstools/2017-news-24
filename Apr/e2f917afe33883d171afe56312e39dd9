More than half-a-million tourists from Saudi Arabia visited Egypt in 2016, followed by Jordan with 180 000 visitors.Employs millionsBefore Egypt's 2011 uprising, Italy, the UK and Russia were Egypt's top markets, in addition to Germany. The uprising, however, decimated Egypt's multibillion dollar tourism industry, which is a vital pillar of the country's economy and employs millions of people.The year before the upheaval, nearly 15 million tourists visited Egypt. Last year, the figure was 5.3 million tourists, according to the chairperson of Egypt's Tourism Authority Hicham al-Demairi.Russia, however, continues to ban all flights to Egypt and Egypt's national carrier is still barred from flying to Russia following the downing of a Russian passenger jetliner in the Sinai Peninsula in 2015 that killed all 224 aboard. A Sinai-based Islamic Stage group affiliate claimed it was behind the incident and Russia says an explosive device was the cause, but the investigation has not yet formally concluded.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
