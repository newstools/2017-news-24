It is therefore a very important programme for government and the people."Zuma said the programme also sought to ensure that farmers own 70% of wealth created through it.The programme, to be rolled throughout the 44 districts of the country, is also intended to integrate small informal sector farmers into the mainstream economy."For far too long small-holder farmers, in particular black farmers, have been strictly confined to economic participation in the informal sector with the focus on primary agriculture, while large commercial farmers are operating within the formal economy footprint right along the value chain. We are working to change this situation and bring about much needed transformation," said Zuma.WATCH:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
