I&rsquo;m still alive and there is life beyond political office.&rdquo; However, Peters cautioned: &ldquo;There are certain things you neglect when you are in political office, like your health&rdquo;. Late last month she landed in intensive care at Steve Biko Hospital and &ldquo;that for me was a wake-up call&rdquo;.Her doctor was among the first to call her after Zuma&rsquo;s announcement and suggested that this may be the answer &ldquo;because they had been worried about my health&rdquo;.&lt;br _moz_dirty="" /&gt;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
