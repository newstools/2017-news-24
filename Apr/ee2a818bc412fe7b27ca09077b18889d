He promised the crowd that going into the future, a coalition government would be in place in 2019. &ldquo;Change is coming&hellip;Our &rsquo;94 is coming in 2019.&rdquo; 'Time up' for Zuma The opposition leader was in a soaringly optimistic mood, declaring that &ldquo;the future for South Africa has never been better than what I see today&rdquo;. Maimane ended his address by calling on those gathered to hold hands with the person next to them.&nbsp; The crowd did so lifting their linked arms in the air, as Maimane quoted an extract from the national anthem, before promising to meet again at ongoing protests against Zuma: &ldquo;We will see you on the streets,&rdquo; he said. Earlier, United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa told supporters that in 2019, the ANC would be &ldquo;punished&rdquo;, while Congress of the People head Mosiuoa Lekota said that those who supported Zuma were &ldquo;enemies of the people&rdquo;. African Christian Democratic Party leader Kenneth Meshoe said it was simply &ldquo;time up&rdquo; for Zuma &ndash; a sentiment reiterated by the crowd many of whom held up red cards &ndash; as used by a soccer referee as a sign that a player has been ordered to leave the field. Freedom Day commemorates the country's first post-apartheid elections held in 1994. This year signals 23 years of South Africa's democracy.&nbsp; The various groups represented at the rally have dubbed themselves the Freedom Movement. &nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
