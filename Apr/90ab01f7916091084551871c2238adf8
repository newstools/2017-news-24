Egypt has faced a series of jihadist attacks targeting its Christian minority, which makes up around 10% of the country's population of 92 million.The December attack was followed by twin church bombings in the cities of Tanta and Alexandria earlier this month on Palm Sunday, that were also claimed by ISIS and killed 45 people.Earlier on Friday, the pontiff and Tawadros embraced as they met outside Saint Mark's Cathedral, the Coptic religious leader's headquarters.Banners featuring both popes spilled down the building's facade, as Francis embarked on the latest step of a tightly controlled visit.Tanks guarded the headquarters where only those with invitations were permitted to enter.Policemen were stationed every few metres in the surrounding central Cairo middle-class neighbourhood, sometimes searching the bags of passers-by.Members of the security forces also monitored the streets below from rooftops.Tawadros welcomed the pope with a speech in a room adorned with illustrations of stories from the Coptic tradition.One portrayed the Holy Family in Egypt, Mary atop a donkey and cradling the baby Jesus, Joseph by her side.The Bible speaks only briefly of the flight to Egypt, on orders from the Archangel Gabriel after King Herod decided to kill all male newborns under his jurisdiction.But Coptic texts speak of a lengthy three-year odyssey by the Holy Family through Egypt, punctuated by miracles.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
