Replying to a question posed by Mogoeng about whether or not he was aware of this, Nhlangulela said: "I only have two eyes. If only I had 10 eyes I would know so now I am relying on what I am told. I am doing my best."Mogoeng failed to find his response funny, especially after another commissioner had pointed out that the matter of judges' late coming was reported on in the media. Mogoeng said he had a problem with the manner in which Nhlangulela was making light of the serious matter."I am sorry, Chief Justice," Nhlangulela sheepishly replied.Shortage of female judgesNhlangulela is one of four judges competing for the position. Earlier, one of his competitors, Judge Mandela Makaula, painted a picture of the challenges faced in the Eastern Cape, which include a shortage of female judges.Makaula said Grahamstown was a "tricky horse to ride" and had only&nbsp;produced three black judges. He told the JSC that there were 82 advocates in the province, but only 10 of them were black and of those, only three were women.He touched on the lack of courts in the province, saying witnesses travelled long distances to get to courts, and those using public transport only arrived in town after 10:00.&nbsp;Quizzed on what contributed to the lack of female judges, he said: "The major problem is mentoring. They have to be mentored."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
