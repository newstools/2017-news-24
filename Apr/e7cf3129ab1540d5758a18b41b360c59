Hospital spokesperson Phumza Morai said hospital s HIV-Aids, STI and TB Department (Hast) became proactive and raised awareness about the burden of TB and its complications. We still see patients who have stopped taking their medication even though they haven t finished the full six- month course due to the fact that they start feeling better. This is very dangerous because they become worse and their TB escalates to a multi-drug resistant TB, said Morai.At the Hast department s visit to Illovo Sugar Mill on March 8 the hospital staff screened 97 employees for TB.A total of 120 Illovo staff were educated on TB and HIV and three were referred to hospital for other medical problems. As long as we breathe, we all stand a risk of catching TB, hence we call on everybody in the Ugu district to join the drive by ensuring that people suspected to have TB are advised to visit a clinic for tests and treatment, said Morai.She said if TB is not treated timeously, it can bring a lot of suffering that goes with emotional and psychological strain to the patient and family members, let alone the financial burden carried by the Department of Health to treat the patient. The hospital management would like to thank Matron Tisha Pillay, Hast, medical and OPD nurses and operations manager Dlikilili for conducting the campaign.- Supplied.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
