It's a big blow," James Tumusiime, managing director of Observer Media, said.Tumusiime described the newspaper, which he co-founded with a collective of journalists, as "a voice of reason" in a "landscape that is politically polarised."Since elections in February 2016 secured another five-year term for President Yoweri Museveni who has ruled the east African country since 1986, there has been a spate of break-ins targeting activist and civil society organisations. A group of 31 non-governmental organisations has petitioned the police, calling for urgent and transparent investigations.Kavuma, an award-winning journalist, described the break-in as "an attack on one of the independent voices the country - it's bad for democracy, it's bad for the media."Kampala's police on Saturday condemned "in the strongest words possible" the break-in at The Observer, and said they would work to apprehend the criminals.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
