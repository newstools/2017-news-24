The country is considered a reliable Western ally in a region often roiled by violence, but critics say hostility to dissent is growing in Uganda.Activists such as Nyanzi, who was charged with cybercrimes on Monday, have criticised Museveni&rsquo;s alleged corruption and nepotism, as well as rights violations by security agencies. The 72-year-old Museveni has been in power for more than three decades.Nyanzi said that, instead of being offended by her language, Ugandans should be offended by the president&rsquo;s failure to keep his promises, including a pledge to provide free sanitary pads for poor girls so they don&rsquo;t have to skip school.Nyanzi&rsquo;s lawyer, Nicholas Opiyo, said she told him that prison authorities tried to trick her into taking a psychiatric test shortly after she was arrested.He said that two men presenting themselves as ordinary doctors were from a government mental hospital.During her court hearing, prosecutors asked for an evaluation of her mental health, which she refused to take part in.Frank Baine, a spokesperson for Uganda&rsquo;s prisons department, denied the men were mental health specialists. The medical exam was &ldquo;a routine medical exam that every new inmate undergoes to avoid risks of spreading infection&rdquo;, he said.International rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have called for Nyanzi&rsquo;s release. &ndash; Reuters 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
