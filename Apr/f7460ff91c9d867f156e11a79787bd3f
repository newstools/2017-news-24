Parties wishing to send representatives could do so and Baartman would then accept brief written heads before reserving judgment.Case's basis in common law 'misplaced'De Vos' junior, Advocate Danie Brand, delivered closing arguments on behalf of the community. Brand restated that the basis of the community's case was that there was no one present at court "that would say that it is fair that this group of people, this community now be removed from this piece of land that they've used for 185 years".He also emphasised that the school, church and community on Grootkraal were one and the same.Brand disputed the claims Advocate Lawrie Wilkin made on Wednesday that the case's basis in common law was "misplaced". Wilkin represents the Kobot Besigheid Trust and petitioned Baartman to come to a decision based on legislation.Legislation, such as the Communal Land Rights Act, Brand said, had been struck down by the Constitutional Court. Moreover, the act did not apply to disputes over private land. He also said the Subdivision of Agricultural Land Act was not valid as it only applied to servitudes (rights to use land) applied after 1974.The community claims to have been using land on the Grootkraal property since the early 1800s.Brand argued that because the land had been used "uninterruptedly for a long period of time" and the exact origin of the use had been lost, it should be assumed that the community has the right to use the land.Trust obligated to 'minimise disruption'Granting the right to use the land, Brand said, was the only way that Baartman could "guarantee the possibility for continuing the school on [Grootkraal]...in perpetuity".For his part, Wilkin asserted on behalf of the trust that it had "fulfilled its obligations" to the pupils and emphasised that the primary responsibility for the well-being of the students was the state's."At most the trust's constitutional obligation...was to minimise the disruption of the side of the learners," Wilkin said.He asked Baartman to "remember the efforts" the trust took to "protect the rights of the learners" in negotiations with the MEC.He also stressed that an eviction order must be given an order to begin the process of relocating the pupils and for the state to begin directing resources to do so. He said that if Baartman ruled in favour of an eviction order it also did "not mean the community would not have access to the school immediately," following the action.Advocate Ewald De Villiers-Jansen, for the Western Cape department of education, said that the trust was attempting to "draw the MEC into the opposition".He also said that since the Grootkraal school had "disavowed any reliance on the MEC," the department could not "be held responsible for the actions which the school adopted".Closing proceedings, Judge Baartman said that only after reviewing the case materials, including briefs filed after the visit, would she be able to come to a determination."I don't want a note in three weeks' time saying, 'Where is the judgment?'" she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
