He was diagnosed with thyroid cancer at the age of five.&nbsp;Graeme, who is dependant on an oxygen tank 24 hours a day, says he is at the gathering for healing. "I came here to pray that the Lord must please heal me."&nbsp;Marita says her desire is to have Angus Buchan pray for her child.&nbsp;"We sit a stone&rsquo;s throw away from the stage and my prayer is that they pray for my child so that his suffering can end."&nbsp;She says they&rsquo;ve been walking a long road and it breaks her heart to see her child like this.&nbsp;"We are looking for a miracle, for healing," she says.&nbsp;Hundreds of thousands of people from across the country and abroad had already taken their place at the prayer meeting. Roughly a million are expected to attend.&nbsp;The gathering was set to start at 12:00, but has been delayed by heavy traffic leading towards the venue.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
