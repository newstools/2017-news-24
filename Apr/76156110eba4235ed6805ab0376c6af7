Then Zuma reshuffled his Cabinet last Thursday. Hanekom was one of those who lost his job."We know that what happened destroyed the confidence that the investor community had in South Africa, and who gets most affected? It's poor working class people who get most affected. We also have to ask who benefits."IntentionsHe would not comment on whether the party's decision to force its MPs to vote a certain way was correct, or if it would change his mind."You know by now that we are not afraid to raise some of these issues in our national executive committee and even in our own caucus."Obviously I share the concerns of many South Africans that the motive for the reshuffling, the way it was done, and the underlying intentions, were not noble."If asked, he would serve as minister again."That's not what it's about though. It's about serving the people of the country with integrity."Hanekom surprised an ANC NEC meeting in November when he brought a motion of no confidence in Zuma. After a fierce debate, no vote took place and Zuma stayed on as president. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
