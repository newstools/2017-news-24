Lili became well-known as the leader of Ses&rsquo;Khona the organisation that threw human faeces in its protests.Daimoni said, &ldquo;Lili gave us permission and encouraged us to rebuild the shacks that the officials have destroyed.&rdquo;Ziyanda Ngxuma expressed anger that law enforcement officials destroyed &ldquo;things that were inside&rdquo; the shacks in her mother&rsquo;s yard, as well as the shacks. &ldquo;My mother has an agreement with the owners of the shacks that says they can stay here and I don&rsquo;t know where the officials fit in,&rdquo; she said.Khonzuyise Ndongeni, 58, who stayed in a shack in his nephew&rsquo;s yard said: &ldquo;They demolished my shack, which cost me R6 000 and I haven&rsquo;t even finished paying for it. They destroyed everything and left only my bed.&rdquo; Ndongeni said he now has no place to stay.Lili told GroundUp, &ldquo;It is rude and wrong of city officials to remove those residents and destroy their shacks. The residents must stand up for themselves and I will join them.&rdquo;Compromise firebreaksXanthea Limberg, Mayco Member for Informal Settlements, Water and Waste Services, told GroundUp that &ldquo;the structures were dismantled because they were built illegally on City-administered land. The City cannot permit unregulated occupation of land as it could hinder future service provision, prevent access to existing underground services for the purposes of maintenance, or compromise firebreaks.&rdquo;Limberg said she was unaware of Lili&rsquo;s call for people to rebuild their shacks. &ldquo;However,&rdquo; she said they would investigate and warned councillors should not incite illegal land invasions. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
