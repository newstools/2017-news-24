He also distanced himself from the race last weekend when he welcomed Cleopas Maunye, the former Bushbuckridge Residents&rsquo; Association secretary and provincial legislature member, back into the ANC, along with 1 500 association members.&ldquo;I am not willing to stand. Groupings are resulting in the demise of the ANC. Our contribution as Mpumalanga is about uniting the organisation,&rdquo; he said.However, bringing back sidelined comrades and uniting the party seems to be Mabuza&rsquo;s way of securing ANC branches&rsquo; support when he runs for the position of deputy president in December. Mabuza has also vowed to bring Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema and the EFF&rsquo;s Mpumalanga leader, Collen Sedibe, back into the ANC fold. Sedibe said Mabuza asked for a meeting after a legislature sitting on Thursday, adding that he would meet the premier and turn him down.EFF secretary-general Godrich Gardee rejected Mabuza again this week, saying the party was not formed to be a parking station, with the intention &ldquo;to return to a burning house called the ANC&rdquo;.&ldquo;ANC stalwarts, [labour federation] Cosatu and social movements sprouting all over are saying that the ANC is rotten and captured by the Indian Gupta family. We are not going back,&rdquo; said Gardee.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
