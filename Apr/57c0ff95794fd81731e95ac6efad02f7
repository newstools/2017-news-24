This is how we see you, take it from us."He said the quickly changing media and communications environment made the completion of the migration from analogue to digital broadcasting even more urgent, so that new media voices can be heard.A new deadline of 31 December 2018 has been set for full migration to be completed.This was after South Africa missed the worldwide deadline of June 2015. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
