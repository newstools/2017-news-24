The power and security vacuum turned the country into a breeding ground for militias and militants, including Islamic State extremists and al-Qaeda affiliates. It has also made Libya a gateway for thousands of migrants from Africa and elsewhere seeking to cross the Mediterranean to Italy.Since 2014, Libya has been split between rival governments and parliaments based in the western and eastern regions, each backed by different militias, tribes and political factions.Basic servicesA UN-brokered deal in December 2015 to create a unity government has failed because the UN-backed government now in Tripoli has been unable to win the endorsement of Libya's internationally recognised Parliament in eastern Tobruk, which is a prerequisite to assume power.Guterres said the UN-backed Presidency Council and government remained "constrained in their ability to govern effectively and to provide much needed basic services and security to the population".He said the 2015 political agreement continued to be supported by the majority of Libyans and interested countries "as the only political framework to lead the country forward".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
