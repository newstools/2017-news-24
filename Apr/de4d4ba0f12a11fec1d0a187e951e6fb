He had tried his best to avoid them, he said.Judge Rosheni Allie asked the two witnesses, police officers, who were sitting in the public gallery, to stand up.She warned them and Dawjee of the consequences of interacting."From your perspective, it also impacts on your credibility."The trial continues. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
