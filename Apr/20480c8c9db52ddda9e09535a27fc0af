Police found at least 30 spent cartridges on the scene.Constant changes in legal representation and outstanding evidence documents have led to regular postponements in the matter since April 2016.The State alleges that Issa was killed because he and Krejcir had argued over R500 000, which Issa had lent Krejcir for a bail application in another case.Krejcir claimed his mother had sent him bail money and that it was Issa who owed him R500 000. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
