The best way to do this is to start a transition process as soon as possible," said Cavusoglu."We need to establish a transition government."There were protests outside the Russian and Iranian embassies in Ankara on Friday, with hundreds of demonstrators carrying 100 black coffins with images of children killed in Tuesday's attack in Idlib, an AFP photographer said.The coffins had "murderer Assad" and "tyrant Putin" written on them.In a statement, the Turkish foreign ministry said Ankara would give its "full support to steps taken to ensure that similar crimes do not go unpunished and [that there is] accountability". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
