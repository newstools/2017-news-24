They were not sick, they had no reason, they told me they didn&rsquo;t want to leave me behind,&rdquo; she said as Ernest shakes next to her, unable to make eye contact.&nbsp; The mother of five said she forced them to go to school and promised that when they returned, she would have prepared a special seven colours meal for them.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I said that to them, they finally agreed to go. But when I walked with them to the transport, Siyabonga kept looking back; he did not want to leave.&rdquo;&nbsp; His last words to her were: &ldquo;Mommy, don&rsquo;t forget to feed our doves. Look after them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her children loved their doves.&nbsp; Later that day, while busy with her house chores, Florence&rsquo;s neighbour Pretty Mnguni knocked at her door and told her she had just received a call informing her that a kombi transporting schoolchildren had caught fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;When we arrived I didn&rsquo;t see anything but fire. I closed my eyes, praying to God and hoping it was not the same kombi my sons used.&rdquo;&nbsp; She found out her sons were dead when the names of the seven crash survivors were read out to parents at Sizakele Primary School in Verena.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am heartbroken. But I cannot blame myself for forcing them to go to school that day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mahlenga Secondary School Grade 8 pupil Melusi Nxumalo, 14, also died in the taxi. He kissed his eight-month old sister goodbye on Friday morning. His mother, Zinhle, was surprised because he had never done this before, and now believes it was his way of saying goodbye.&nbsp; Selina Nxumalo, Melusi&rsquo;s aunt and the family&rsquo;s spokesperson, said: &ldquo;Melusi was her pride and joy. He was a brilliant child with a bright future. She believed he would one day get her out of poverty.&nbsp; &ldquo;When his mother asked why he was so loving that morning, he said: &lsquo;I am her elder brother; who else can love her like I do?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; On Friday night, a devastated Themba Maseko, the uncle of another victim, Mnelisi Khambule, 15, said at the school where the relatives had gathered: &ldquo;He was serious about education and would have changed the situation in the family.&rdquo;&nbsp; The pupils&rsquo; parents had hired the taxi to transport them. It collided with a horse-and-trailer truck on the R25 between Bronkhorstspruit and Groblersdal.&nbsp; Maseko&rsquo;s niece, Cebile, 13, who is in Grade 8, was not seriously injured in the smash. She was taken to KwaMhlanga hospital and discharged on Friday night.&nbsp; &ldquo;She keeps asking about her brother. She was sitting next to him in the taxi. We don&rsquo;t understand how she made it if he died,&rdquo; Maseko said.&nbsp; Three children remain in hospital in critical condition. The Mpumalanga authorities have yet to release the names and ages of the deceased children because they are still verifying the information.&nbsp; On Friday night, Maseko said: &ldquo;It is heartbreaking. My nephew was serious about education. He was clever. We hoped that he was going to change things for the better for us.&rdquo;&nbsp; On Saturday, he was among the relatives expected to identify the bodies of their dead children at KwaMhlanga hospital.&nbsp; Dudu Mvakali, a member of the school governing body at Refano Primary, said she was devastated by the crash. &ldquo;We have lost our pupils and are all hurt.&rdquo;&nbsp; When City Press arrived at the school on Friday night, authorities were establishing teams of officials from Gauteng and Mpumalanga to help the families.&nbsp; Mvakali said the pupils were at Gauteng schools as isiZulu was not offered at schools in Mpumalanga.&nbsp; &ldquo;We hire taxis to transport our children,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; Eyewitnesses said some of the deceased pupils were burnt beyond recognition.&nbsp; Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi was on the crash scene shortly after the incident.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have never seen so many motionless bodies of children in my entire life. I was severely devastated and emotionally drained,&rdquo; he told City Press.&nbsp; He said to help identify the bodies, he had alerted his department&rsquo;s forensic unit and that of Gauteng&rsquo;s health department to assist in testing the DNA of the dead children to identify them. Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa had agreed to help, he said.&nbsp; Lesufi said a committee would be established today to finalise funeral details for the children.&nbsp; He said he had been told that the children were studying in Gauteng as they were unable to learn isiZulu in nearby schools, which offered isiNdebele.&nbsp; Joseph Mabuza, spokesperson for the Mpumalanga department of community safety, security and liaison, said police took the truck driver to a police station after the crash for his own safety.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was sent to the hospital for a check-up, and later discharged,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Mabuza said a case of culpable homicide was opened and an investigation was under way to establish the cause of the accident.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
