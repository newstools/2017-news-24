Unsurprisingly, it all starts with a screen.Women's marchIt was shortly after the US election results were tallied and the American people woke up to the strange reality of Donald Trump as their new president that Hawaiian retiree Teresa Shook wrote one simple line in a private political Facebook group she belongs to: "I think we should march."After one woman responded positively, Shook decided to create an event and invited a few dozen friends to participate before going to sleep. By the time she logged back onto Facebook the next morning, her event had taken on a life of its own with thousands of people having indicated their interest to join. Within days, the number had grown to 300 000 and women from all corners of the states started contacting Shook to help guide the event.Shook's simple invitation ended up sparking the historical Women's March on 21 January 2017, the day after Trump's inauguration. Apart from the first planned protest that took place in Washington D.C. and drew at least 500 000 people, another 673 marches took place worldwide, collectively mobilising more than 5 million participants on all seven continents. Home-grown hashtags Locally, the protest culture we've been cultivating seems largely hashtag-driven, which points clearly to the central role the internet plays in getting marches off the ground and, perhaps more importantly, keeping them going.The origins can, of course, be traced back to #RhodesMustFall, followed a short while later by #FeesMustFall. Unsurprisingly, both these movements were organised by a millennial contingent, most of whom would also qualify as digital natives. The hashtag-mustfall naming convention has proven so successful in creating online hype and spreading the word that it has now been widely adopted across all sectors of South African resistance movements, much to the dismay of 'fallists' who feel their original cause is being tainted by the bandwagon. A far cry from slacktivismWhat sets these online-driven protests apart from limp-limbed slacktivism, where you are encouraged to 'make a difference' by simply clicking "Like" or "Share", is the fact that they actually succeed in getting people off their cushy couches (or office chairs) and out into the streets, the squares, the sidewalks and the commons.In other words, while the origin of these movements may ultimately be private, their execution is public and doubly so, as real-time images, videos and thoughts are shared across social media platforms. Once shared, these posts instantly start forming an organic, searchable and unmediated archive, offering raw and unfiltered insights by those taking part.So, while cyberspace is often seen as a replacement for public space, it's clear that the two seem to work best when overlapping. Especially when it comes to the mobilisation of a nation.- Nadia Krige is the digital editor at Cape Town Partnership.
