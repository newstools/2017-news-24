Those he axed included finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas. Ratings agencies Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s and Fitch downgraded South Africa&rsquo;s credit ratings and thousands of people took part in nationwide protests against Zuma.Suspended ANC Western Cape chairperson Marius Fransman rejected the PEC's statement.On Monday, he accused the current Western Cape ANC leadership, and provincial member and former tourism minister Derek Hanekom of trying to undermine the party in the province.He added that it was not true that ANC membership in the province had dropped, and the party had actually increased its numbers in the province since 2014.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
