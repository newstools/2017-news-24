"Children must be treated for malnutrition now ... Famine is a distinct possibility for Somalia.It is an absolute travesty that this is even conceivable when just six years ago this same region was hit by a famine that killed over 250000 people."The drought has left 6.2 million people - more than half of the population of Somalia - in need of immediate lifesaving assistance and a further 8.3 million in Kenya and Ethiopia are also need of urgent help, he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
