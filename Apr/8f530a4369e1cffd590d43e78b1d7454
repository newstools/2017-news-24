The plant would produce 10 million litres of drinking water per day for the central and southern suburbs of Cape Town."We will progressively intensify water restrictions and will reduce water pressure further to lower consumption, which could in cases lead to intermittent supply over larger areas of the metro at the same time," said mayoral committee member for informal settlements, water and waste services, and energy, Xanthea Limberg.Rainfall over parts of the city would not materially change the low levels. Should dams reach below 10% of storage levels, a "lifeline" water supply would be implemented.This would involve minimal supply pressure, intermittent supply, and very stringent restrictions. People in areas with low water pressure might have to get their water from tankers.The city council could also install water management devices for consumers who failed to limit consumption, even if they already paid the highest tariffs.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
