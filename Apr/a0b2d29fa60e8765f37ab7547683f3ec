We are waiting for them [ACM] to get back to us so we can meet and come up with an amicable solution," said Shange.ACM spokesperson Yashica Padia confirmed that the organisation had not met with the ANCYL "because we did not receive a response to our letter".When asked if the response the movement was still waiting for was the public apology, she could not comment but said it was "as stated in our letter".On whether ACM was still willing to take the ANCYL back to court, Padia said it was still going to consult with its committee. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
