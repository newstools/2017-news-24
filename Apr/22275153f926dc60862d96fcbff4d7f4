"There is one issue we need to solve and that is Guerguerat," he said.Uruguay and Russia however said the draft resolution lacked balance."It's very unbalanced in the way it handles the Polisario," said Uruguay's Ambassador Elbio Rosselli, adding that the text failed to mention the broader context of "how we go to where we are". Last month, long-serving UN envoy Christopher Ross resigned following tensions with Morocco, which accused him of bias in favor of the Polisario.Former German president Horst Kohler has been tipped to replace him.The draft resolution calls on Morocco and the Polisario Front to "resume negotiations" with a view to achieving a "just, lasting and mutually acceptable solution."The council "affirms its full support for the commitment of the secretary-general and his personal envoy towards a solution to the question of Western Sahara," according to the draft.The United Nations opened negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario Front in 2007 and there have been several rounds since, with the latest held outside of New York in 2012. There has been little progress however over resolving the future status of Western Sahara.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
