This is a sad day for journalism.&rdquo;Huffington Post South Africa is a joint venture between Media24 and Huffington Post international.&nbsp;Fury erupted on social media on Friday after it was established that Shelley Garland was not a student at the University of Cape Town and most likely an imposter.&nbsp;Huffington Post South Africa subsequently removed the blog on Saturday and promised to increase scrutiny when publishing future blogs.&nbsp;&ldquo;We apologise for the oversight. We welcome further discussion,&rdquo; editor-in-chief Verashni Pillay wrote in a blog post.&nbsp;&ldquo;We have bolstered and strengthened our blogging procedures that, until now, have operated on the basis of open communication and good faith. From now on, bloggers will have to verify themselves.&rdquo;* News24 is a Media24 publication 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
