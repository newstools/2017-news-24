People should be able to vote freely, without fear of intimidation.&rdquo;Ndlozi said the EFF would support the UDM with additional legal counsel.&ldquo;We want to ensure that the court sees that this is not only a one-party application, but that the opposition is united.&ldquo;We want to give people the freedom to express their vote without intimidation, which is at the core of a democratic practice.&rdquo;Parties opposing the UDM&rsquo;s application had until 12:00 on Thursday to file an affidavit. The UDM had to file its reply by 16:00 on Wednesday.The vote of no confidence would have been held on Tuesday. Parliament however said it would postpone it until the Constitutional Court had heard the matter.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
