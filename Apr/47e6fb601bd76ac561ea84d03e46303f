You've got to pursue what you see is right."She said it was not the first time she had received a threat. She understood why people would threaten someone's job or position within their party, but a violent threat overstepped the mark, she said.Parliament said it would take action."Parliament does not take the alleged threats lightly, and a report would be made to the Speaker of the National Assembly in order for the institution to determine an appropriate course of action," it said at the time.Parliament spokesperson Moloto Mothapo was not immediately available for comment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
