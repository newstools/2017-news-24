Deeply concerning as well is the level of irregular expenditure by municipalities, at R300m," Nomusa Dube-Ncube said in Durban.She was speaking at a meeting with officials of the province's poorly-performing municipalities.On Wednesday, Auditor General Kimi Makwetu presented the financial state of the province's municipalities.In the 2013/14 financial year, the province received 20 clean audits."This result is truly disappointing and it must be a wake-up call for all senior municipal officials whose poor performance has caused this, as well as all mayors and councillors," Dube-Ncube said.Government could not begin to "radically transform" local economies for the benefit of the poor if municipalities continued to perform poorly, she said.Some of the poor performance could be attributed to inadequate reporting and non-compliance with local government legislation.Poor financial management of municipal resources, of which irregular expenditure and flawed procurement processes were the chief symptoms, was also responsible, she said.Following recent interventions in a number of the province's municipalities, her department would take the hard and often unpopular decision and place those that were failing under administration, she said.Municipalities overpaying for substandard services at the expense of their residents had to be addressed.Transparent, equitable and efficient supply-chain processes had to be implemented and monitored.She encouraged municipalities to communicate service delivery projects with residents to avoid protests. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
