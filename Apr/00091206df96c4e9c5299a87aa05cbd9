According to Washington Post, the Israeli authorities have also urged Israelis to leave the North African country. The Israeli government said its intelligence indicated &ldquo;increased activity&rdquo; by the Islamic State in the Sinai Peninsula and a &ldquo;desire to commit terrorist attacks against tourists in Sinai, including Israelis, in the immediate term.&rdquo;But an Egyptian journalist and author of a book on the Islamist insurgency in Sinai, Mohannad Sabry, was cited saying that Egyptian military was capable of controlling the Sinai. The border closure come after&nbsp;two church attacks in the northern Egyptian cities of Tanta and Alexandria that killed at least 44 people and injured more than 100. The attacks, carried out by suicide bombers and claimed by the Islamic State, came as worshipers gathered for Palm Sunday services.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
