Later that day, a labour court ruled that the strike was not allowed under terms of the crew members' contracts.Currently, cabin crew members get a meal allowance of $130 per trip. They wanted $170, arguing that the allowance had not increased in half a dozen years and that they stay in international hotels where food is expensive.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
