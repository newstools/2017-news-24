Whatever the reasons, be it bias, incompetence, negligence or fraud, the lack of transparency and accountability of public officials under the glare of the Constitution was decisive," she said.In her ruling on the costs issue on Wednesday, Judge Pillay said she had trawled through the affidavits of the responsible officials and the "puzzling question" remained: How did the entire procurement team, including officials, financial experts, legal advisers and engineers get it wrong?'They decided that chalk is cheese'"They decided that a quotation was the equivalent of a letter of undertaking and that the provision of professional indemnity insurance qualifies as underwriting for underground leaks for individual dwelling units."Metaphorically speaking, they decided that chalk is cheese," the judge said."The possible explanations range from mistake, ignorance, incompetence, negligence, corruption or something else. However none of the deponents advance any of these possibilities."They persist in defending what is now manifestly indefensible to try to justify their conduct in order to avoid paying the costs."Their responses fortify their failure and continuing refusal to be not only accountable and transparent, but also remorseful for their manifestly inexplicable decision."She said contrary to regulations, none of the committees or officials had exercised their independent impartial discretion and while a legal adviser had advised that the South West bid should be disqualified, they "cow-towed and capitulated" to the bid evaluation committee.City urged to investigate furtherA recurring theme, she said, was non-disclosure.But, she said, she could not single out individuals as having committed acts of corruption "however, given how bizarre the decision is, I cannot exclude that possibility".Judge Pillay encouraged the city to further investigate the awarding of the tender.On the role of South West, she said it had the most to gain and its misrepresentations were not naive or innocent."No one tendering to provide underwriting insurance for water leaks can genuinely mistake professional indemnity insurance as compliance [with the tender], not when insurance for leaks is the core service for which the tender is issued, not when the potential reward is as high as R80m and definitely not when the risks of non-delivery for the residents of eThekwini would be catastrophic."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
