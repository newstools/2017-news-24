We're paying the price for this."The individuals spoke to News24 with permission from the man's family.Their identities, including that of the man, are being withheld due to security reasons.Two men were wounded in Caf&eacute; Caprice in the early hours of Monday in what is believed to be violence linked to a major power tussle for control of the lucrative nightclub security industry.Three suspects were arrested on attempted murder charges, but the charges were withdrawn in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Wednesday and they were released from custody.Initially on Monday several sources, with ties to police as well as within the legal fraternity, had told News24 that one of the two men wounded was a businessman whose tyre service centre was petrol bombed in Observatory in May 2016.But the businessman, who News24 tried to contact on Monday, said on Wednesday that he was not involved in the incident, but that his name had been intentionally dragged into the matter as part of an elaborate plot.The sources later confirmed the businessman had not been shot as initially thought.'He's just pure'Some well-placed sources, one particularly close to the matter, claimed the businessman and man were close friends.But on Thursday those close to the man said he was in no way linked to those involved in the violence, nor the businessman.They said they had never before heard of the businessman."He's just pure. He won't harm a fly," one said."In [his whole life] he never had an argument with one of his friends."Another said that on Monday evening the man and about 15 friends had felt like going out to relax and enjoy some food.But the individual said because they had heard about the power tussle over club security, they had purposefully avoided the city centre and gone to Caf&eacute; Caprice in Camps Bay."It's not a club. It's a caf&eacute; which plays music as it gets later. They wanted to relax themselves with some nice food."Another said the man was totally "innocent"."He's kind, nice and friendly. He's a kind-hearted person with the most beautiful smile. Hundreds in the community and his friends say so."The individuals said the man represented "hundreds and thousands of young people who are going out"."But now they do not have the freedom to go out and enjoy themselves."They understood the second man wounded in the shooting may have been a tourist.On Thursday police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut said the shooting was still under investigation.The club security power struggle boiled over about three weeks ago when businessman Nafiz Modack, previously linked to an alleged scam involving luxury cars, started taking over security at various venues.He therefore effectively started ousting an older grouping which has for years dominated the club security scene. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
