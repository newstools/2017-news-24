According to the Tongaat SAPS, the victim was sitting in his car when a gun-wielding man fired a shot towards him. The victim sustained a gunshot wound to his hand.    Police spokesperson in Tongaat Warrant Officer Manisha Maharaj-Marie told the Weekly: “Police are investigating a case of attempted murder, whereby it is alleged by the victim that he was in his car at Gandhi’s Hill when an unknown man approached him and fired a shot through the driver’s side window. However, he managed to escape from the vehicle.”  Maharaj could not confirm whether the attack was related to taxi violence. Head of Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) Prem Balram said the injured taxi boss was treated at the scene and taken to hospital.  Balram said the suspect escaped in an awaiting VW Polo.
