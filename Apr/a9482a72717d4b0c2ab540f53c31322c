The decision was the result of an agreement between the Gauteng provincial legislature, SA Council of Churches, and various minibus taxi operators in the province.It was hoped this would result in &ldquo;harmonious and peaceful&rdquo; taxi operations over Easter, the legislature&rsquo;s roads and transport committee chairperson, Jacob Khawe, said.The permits would be issued only to legal operators. They had to apply to the department three days before departure. Applicants had to produce their operating permit and a letter of request, signed under oath, from their client or organisation, detailing their destination, number of passengers, purpose of the trip, and the dates of departure from and return to Gauteng. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
