Reclaim the City wanted the Tafelberg property to be turned into affordable housing.&nbsp;&ldquo;[The] province, like the colonial and apartheid governments before it, has ensured that the beneficiaries of racial discrimination, who are mostly white people, continue to access, own and occupy our well-located public land,&rdquo; the organisation said in a statement at the time.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
