One can ask anyone and they will tell you how close we were, and on this basis, are shocked about what has happened and cannot believe it."Petina was arrested in a police sting operation in October 2016 after she allegedly tried to arrange her husband's murder.She was arrested in the parking lot of the Lansdowne railway station in Cape Town, following information received by Manenberg police officers.She was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and released on R30 000 bail.In December, she was rearrested for breaking her bail conditions, which included that she not contact Austin directly or indirectly.The court heard she had spoken to him on December 2, just before her case was heard.Planning for the futureThe State said a material witness for the prosecution was intimidated and threatened to such an extent that he and his family had to be placed in witness protection.Her bail was extended and amended with conditions to report to a police station every Friday, not communicate with any witnesses and remain at her current alternative address.In his letter Austin said he could hardly walk or write without his wife.He said he and his wife needed to sit down and plan for their future."We need to consider the children's schooling, the businesses, whether we move elsewhere."On Wednesday the Wynberg Magistrate's Court heard an application by Petina to be allowed back home for the sake of her minor children.The court will pass judgment on the application on May 4. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
