Still, the laws appeal to Nigerians who are fed up with high levels of crime. "There is strong public support for the death penalty," Ugwu said.In Nigeria, the death penalty is imposed for a vast array of crimes, including armed robbery, murder and treason. Some northern states practise sharia law, which imposes capital punishment for adultery, rape and homosexuality.The increase in death sentences is in part due to a resurgence of kidnappings and other crimes in the country's oil-producing south and the ongoing fight against Boko Haram Islamists in the northeast.Last May, Nigeria's senate was considering a new federal law that would make kidnapping a capital crime. Several state governments, such as Oyo in 2016 and Lagos earlier this year, have already introduced such legislation.Kidnapping for ransom, which had declined in recent years, has recently increased as Nigerians face a recession caused by the crash in global oil prices. Overall, Sub-Saharan Africa recorded more death sentences but fewer executions in 2016.At least 22 executions were carried out in five countries - Botswana, Nigeria, South Sudan, Sudan and Somalia. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
