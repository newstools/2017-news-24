The urgent application was filed on Friday, but the matter was delayed for the ANCYL to file an opposing affidavit, which it did late on Friday night.The head of The Active Citizens Group, Benedictor Madokwe, said ANCYL representatives were on record as calling Gordhan an "impimpi" (enemy agent). "In present times it is the most serious accusation that can be directed at a person,&rdquo; Madokwe said. Others had openly questioned Gordhan's loyalty to the ANC and there was a "clear threat of intimidation and violence".However, ANCYL provincial secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo said this was not true, and there was no threat to disrupt the memorial service. "We intend to attend to pay tribute and homage to our struggle icon, Uncle Kathy. [There is] no determination to disrupt the memorial. It would be unbefitting to the honour of Uncle Kathy," Sabelo said.About 1 000 people were expected to attend the event at Sastri College in Durban at 14:30 on Sunday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
