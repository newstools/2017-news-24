Gary Van Dyk @Gvdcapejazz Child protection comes under the spotlight on Saturday with a drive to create awareness around missing children.The Lotus River Community Care and Safety Association is working with various partners, including the police, neighbourhood watches and Missing Persons SA, to make parents aware of how they can help police if children go missing.Naziema Benjamin, secretary of the association, says the drive will be at the Lotus River multipurpose hall on the corner of 6th Avenue and Buck Road from 09:00 to 17:00. There have been some missing children in the area in recent times and we feel that hosting this drive can help parents or caregivers when children go missing, she says. On Saturday we are encouraging parents to bring along a recent photo of their child and complete a kit that could assist the police if their children go missing. We also welcome members of the community who would like to help with this process by bringing along a scale, measuring tape and black pen. Constable Carol Strauss of the Grassy Park police says the police support such initiatives to help with missing children. We are glad that this association is taking on this initiative because the more information we have when a child goes missing helps us tremendously, she says. With the information they collate that includes a photo, fingerprints and other vital information we have something to work with. Benjamin adds that the association was formed earlier this year to work with neighbourhood watches to make the area safer and focus on providing resources for youth empowerment.
