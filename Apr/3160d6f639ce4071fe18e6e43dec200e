It is also not a policy issue that must be determined. In those circumstances an open ballot is understandable."But this mechanism is different... It is a unique and critical mechanism to ensure oversight of the president... The National Assembly is therefore performing a different function when it considers a motion of no confidence."Members of Parliament should thus be able to vote their conscience on whether they still have confidence in the President, including those that report to him.He also said Mbete and Zuma did not dispute media reports in which ANC officials and stalwarts agree with UDM's position, and only dismissed them as "hearsay".Holomisa said they would file more detailed papers on April 21. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
