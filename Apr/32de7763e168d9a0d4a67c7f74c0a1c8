The court ordered him to vacate his office immediately.On March 17, the same court found that former police minister Nathi Nhleko had ignored two court judgments which found that Ntlemeza lacked "integrity and honour" when he appointed him head of the elite police unit.Police Minister Fikile Mbalula on Wednesday said he had withdrawn the ministry's application to appeal the March judgment. He is expected to brief the media on his decision on Thursday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
