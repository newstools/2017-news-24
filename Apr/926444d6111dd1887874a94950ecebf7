Then editor Nic Dawes complained to the Inspector General. This would not only affect journalists' sources but also having a chilling effect on Freedom of Expression, Sole said.The Inspector General wrote back and said that after an investigation they found there was no wrongdoing.InterceptionsIn 2015, it emerged publicly that Sole's communication had been intercepted in 2008 when Michael Hulley, the Attorney of President Jacob Zuma, attached extracts from intercepted conversations between Billy Downer and Sole.Downer was a senior advocate leading the National Prosecuting Authority team investigating charges against Zuma.Sole said there could be no lawful basis under RICA for his conversations to be intercepted in this way.There is no way of knowing for sure your communication has been intercepted and the data could be stored indefinitely, Sole said.Applications for interceptions have shown that at times false information is given to the designated judge to get approval for the intercepts, said Sole.He said one example was when crime Intelligence intercepted two Sunday Times journalists in 2010, Mzilikazi wa Afrika and Stephan Hofstatter, by giving the judge fictional names and saying the information was needed to investigate a criminal syndicate.There appears to be no oversight of the whole process, Sole said.The affidavit indicates that scarily bulk communication surveillance is taking place.This means there is ongoing monitoring, recording and storage of the communications of large sections of the population. The government's national intelligence signals facility is capable of doing this.Amabhungane shows in the papers that close to 100% of interception applications are granted by the RICA judge.The 2009/10 JSCI Report showed that over a four-year period since the Office for Interception Centres was established, three million interceptions were done. This indicates that thousands of interceptions of South Africans were done without any type of court order.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
