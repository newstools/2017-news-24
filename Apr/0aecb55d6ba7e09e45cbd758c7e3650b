Residents started protesting&nbsp;on Sunday after the Municipal Demarcation Board (MDB) rejected their municipal boundary review application last week. Residents of Vuwani and neighbouring areas want&nbsp;to be excluded from the Malamulele municipality.The community submitted a review application after an inter-ministerial team appealed to leaders in Vuwani to suspend protests in July 2016 and consider making an application instead.However, a week ago the MDB rejected the application, angering residents and sparking protests.Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe on Monday said two people had been arrested for malicious damage to property. "Two suspects, aged 26 and 29, were arrested for malicious damage to property and incitement to commit public violence where the passing motorists were stoned in some of the local roads," said Ngoepe. They will appear&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Malamulele Magistrate's Court soon. Ngoepe said police were still monitoring the situation.
