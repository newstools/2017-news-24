	     Cape Town – A Cape Town police officer was killed after his colleague apparently discharged his firearm while cleaning it, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) said on Thursday. The officer was hit in the chest on Wednesday night and died on the scene, according to Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini. He confirmed they were investigating the death and that no arrest had been made. It was understood that the two officers were constables from the SA Police Service's stabilisation unit. They had been sitting in their vehicle at the Kraaifontein police station around 20:30 when the shot was fired from the passenger seat towards the driver seat. Netwerk24 identified the deceased officer as Christopher Mouton, who had been in the police service for nine years. He got married in August last year.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
