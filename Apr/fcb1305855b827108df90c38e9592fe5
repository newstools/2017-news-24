"[President] Jacob Zuma and the ANC have normalised the abuse of the people&rsquo;s money and institutions for self-benefit, while neglecting their duty to create jobs and build a better South Africa," the DA said in a statement. "There is no better case study than the province of Limpopo, corrupted to the point of near bankruptcy, and economically stagnant," the DA added.&nbsp; The march is scheduled to start at 10:00 at SABC Park.&nbsp; Last Wednesday, thousands marched to the Union Buildings, led by opposition party leaders.&nbsp; The march saw EFF leader Julius Malema team up with DA, Cope, UDM and IFP.&nbsp; Political parties are calling for Zuma to step down.

Former finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas were among those who were axed.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
