What we had was a small, organised silent protest. There were only ten people, and we spread ourselves to different entrances, with our posters &ndash; which we had a right to have. That does not require permission," said Peggy Pillay, one of the organisers.The JAI described the Gupta family as "perpetual wrongdoers", saying "they must not use religion to conceal their nefarious deeds or as some kind of public relations exercise to turn the tide of public opinion".Members of Black First Land First (BLF) came to the family's defence after JAI's protest began on Sunday, and interrupted the protesters.BLF said they were there to protect the rights of the Guptas to celebrate their religion, and it would not stand for "agents of Rupert" interrupting the Guptas at their event.Officers from the Parkview Police and Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) were called to the scene by one of the protesters who said she felt intimidated and claimed she was manhandled.Police officers could not verify whether the protest was legal or not. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
