The court granted the UDM access to argue the matter and allowed parties involved to file opposing papers. They had until Friday, April 21 at 16:00 to do so.The UDM subsequently wrote to Mbete to propose that the motion be pushed to the week of April 25 to allow the respondents time to file their papers."An agreement between the parties should also entail this aspect," the UDM said through its lawyers.Parliament spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said Mbete had received the letter and would respond accordingly.Parliament said it had received the court's directives and would comply with the timeframes.He said the court made no injunction regarding the motion of no confidence. It was still scheduled to take place in the National Assembly at 14:00 next Tuesday.Meanwhile, Parliament said earlier on Tuesday that Mbete was not opposed to the principle of a secret ballot on such motions.Mbete held no position on the matter, it said in a statement."Where the Speaker and the UDM disagree is in relation to the powers of the Speaker under the Constitution to make such a determination."The Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Fighters on Tuesday also asked Mbete to postpone the motion of no confidence until after the Constitutional Court hears the matter.The court's decision to hear whether the vote could be done via secret ballot warranted a postponement from its current April 18 date, DA leader Mmusi Maimane said.In a separate letter, EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu said the Constitutional Court case could have a direct bearing on the nature and outcome of the motion.Maimane added while Parliament waits a bit longer to debate Zuma's fate, South Africans should join opposition parties as it marches to the Union buildings on Wednesday on Zuma's 75th birthday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
