"The attack resulted in killing three gendarmes and seizing some weapons and ammunition as spoils," it added.It is believed to be the jihadist alliance's second operation after their merger, following the killing of 11 soldiers in the same area on March 5.Ansar Dine was involved in an onslaught that saw northern Mali fall out of government control for nearly a year from spring 2012.The extremists were later expelled from the region by a French-led international military intervention.Nonetheless large swathes of northern Mali continue to come under attack from jihadist groups.The area is also seen by governments battling the jihadist threat as a launchpad for attacks against other countries in the region.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
