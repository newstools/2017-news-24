After that, you only have one thing in mind: 'get them out of there, get them the heck out of there, let them escape'."He added: "There is a necessity for a humanitarian evacuation for anyone who is a migrant in Libya, regardless of how and why they came in the first place."Hehenkamp also voiced doubts about the possibility of organising large-scale voluntary repatriations."To call it voluntary is a mockery. On the other hand, anything else is probably better than staying in the detention camps," he said."They should be brought to places where they can be assisted, where they can recover, where there is a government with the capacity to take care (of them)."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
