The White Shark is the largest predatory fish on Earth.National Geographic reports that Whites were responsible for a third of the 100 humans killed by sharks annually. Great Whites are endangered, with their numbers decreasing rapidly as a result of over fishing. They are also accidentally caught in gill nets.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
