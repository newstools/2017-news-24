They say now is the time to pray and they are extremely concerned about the country,&nbsp;Netwerk24&nbsp;reports.&nbsp;Jaqueline Deysel, 15, from White River, Mpumalanga, gave up a baby shower to travel to Bloemfontein because she said change is needed urgently.&ldquo;The farm murders and violence in our streets need to change. I want to walk with ease in street.&rdquo;Roelien du Plessis, 48, from Ermelo, said South Africa will come to an end if they do not pray for the country now.&nbsp;&ldquo;It is about the future of our children and grandchildren.&rdquo;Eben Theron, 77, and his wife Alida, 76, came from Kranspoort, Limpopo, because they do not want to sit on the sidelines and watch events unfold.&ldquo;I am excited about the spiritual awakening which I am expecting will take place. There is a deep concern and realisation of the crisis the country is in. There is a spiritual need. However, I don&rsquo;t think people have lost hope,&rdquo; Eben said.&nbsp;&ldquo;The crisis will however not change before people don&rsquo;t apply themselves to the Lord. The Lord will use this event to bring South Africa to its knees. It all starts with prayer and humbling oneself.&rdquo;Jurie Cilliers, 27, from Vereeniging, Gauteng, said he was called to the gathering, being held on the Wilde Als farm, to pray.&nbsp;&ldquo;Everyone who is coming is looking for something. I came to receive a message. Our country now needs to get on track.&ldquo;This is the first time I came to an event like this. It was against my will. At a previous Mighty Men get-together (which was led by Angus Buchan) I arrived with alcohol and thought it would be a nice men&rsquo;s camp. At the second event I was saved,&rdquo; Cilliers said.&nbsp;Tollie du Plessis, 38, had attended three previous Mighty Men events. He arrived on the campsite on Friday.&ldquo;I got goose-bumps. That feeling when a couple of thousand people say amen at the same time. It is an indescribable feeling. I look forward to it.&rdquo; Evangelist Angus Buchan said the Holy Spirit led him to organise the gathering. His organisation said 1.7 million people had confirmed they would be there. On Facebook, 11 000 people said they would attend on Friday evening.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
