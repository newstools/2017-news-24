On Tuesday armed men killed five soldiers and injured 10 others in an attack on an army post in the tense Timbuktu region."Almost every day we receive reports of abominable acts of terrorism committed by enemies of peace and enemies of the country and its people," Mahamat Saleh Annadif, the head of the UN peacekeeping mission in Mali, said on Tuesday.The government on Wednesday said the extension was needed as the "security situation in Mali and in the sub-region is still characterised by the continued threat of terrorism and serious attacks on people and their belongings."The decree hands extra powers to security forces and restricts public gatherings.Mali's north fell under the control of jihadist groups linked to Al-Qaeda in 2012 who hijacked an ethnic Tuareg-led rebel uprising, though the Islamists were largely ousted by a French-led military operation in January 2013.But jihadists continue to roam the country's north and centre, mounting attacks on civilians and the army, as well as French and UN forces still stationed there.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
