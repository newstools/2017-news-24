ANC NEC member and former chief whip Mathole Motshekga has called for a special national executive committee meeting to deal with growing calls for President Jacob Zuma to resign.Motshekga, who is also a member of the party s constitutional committee, further said last week s special extended meeting of the ANC s national working committee (NWC) was irregularly constituted .The NWC meeting followed unprecedented public disagreements by party officials over Zuma s controversial Cabinet reshuffle, which saw the sacking of finance minister Pravin Gordhan, among others.In an interview with News24, Motshekga said the NEC is the only competent body to have a final say on the matter of Zuma s recall. Motshekga is the first senior ANC member to publicly call for a special NEC. It was not adequate for the NWC, which was irregularly constituted, to have a final say on the matters raised by society. The correct position is that on matters of such importance, the NWC must make recommendations to the NEC or a properly constitutional constituted NWC, Motshekga said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
