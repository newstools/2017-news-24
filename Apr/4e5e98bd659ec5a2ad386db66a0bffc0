He made a comparison to the hunt by the United States for the late al-Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden."It took the US up to seven, eight, up to 10 years before they could get to Bin Laden," he said."We are continuing our campaigning in the Sambisa Forest in all its nooks and corners," Ali was quoted as saying.&nbsp;But, according to a member of an influential interfaith group that tries to ensure peace between Nigerian Muslims and Christians,&nbsp;Sheikh Nuru Khalid, if the Chibok girls were not found, that would mean a victory for the insurgent group. This comes just days after Nigerians marked three years since the mass abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls in Chibok. The kidnapping of&nbsp;those schoolgirls from a northern Nigerian town made international headlines and prompted global figures, including former US first lady Michelle Obama and a list of celebrities, to support the #BringBackOurGirls campaign.None of the girls were seen again until May last year when one of the students, Amina Ali, was&nbsp;found in a forest with a baby, along with&nbsp;and a man claiming to be her husband.Her discovery prompted hopes that the girls were alive, and Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari pledged to ensure the release of the remaining girls.&nbsp;Following Amina's recovery, a&nbsp;group of 21 girls was released&nbsp;after Switzerland and the International Red Cross brokered a deal with Boko Haram.Those girls were briefly allowed to return to their homes to spend Christmas&nbsp;with relatives.But, after their brief freedom on Christmas Day, the girls were sent back to a secret location in the capital Abuja for debriefing by the Nigerian government. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
