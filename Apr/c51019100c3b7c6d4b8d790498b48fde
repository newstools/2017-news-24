"We think that, going down this one note route, in and of itself, will not address the challenges that the country has," Selassie said, according to a transcript of the briefing."It&rsquo;s very important to have a more comprehensive policy package which also addresses a lot of the fiscal challenges that the country faces, a lot of the structural reforms that have to be done," he said in answer to a question on Zimbabwe's bond notes.Central bank governor John Mangudya has just indicated that he will stop injecting the new notes - only introduced last November - into the economy for now until, what he calls, "fiscal discipline" is reached.&nbsp;Although initially the governor promised to introduce $200m of the notes, so far $121m worth of them have been brought in (or possibly $130m: conflicting figures have been used in the state press.) President Robert Mugabe's government insists the bond notes are at a parity with the US dollar but there have been cases of retailers insisting on different prices depending on the method of payment.Those with "real" US bills pay less.&nbsp;A technical mission from the Washington-based lender visited Zimbabwe last month. The southern African country cleared its 15-year-old financial arrears with the IMF late last year. It did this by transferring&nbsp;part of its cash holdings at the IMF to the Fund's Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
