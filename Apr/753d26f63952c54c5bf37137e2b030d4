All were claimed by the Islamic State group. Ibrahim Isaac, the Catholic Coptic patriarch in Egypt, has said the papal visit represents "moral and spiritual support" at a time when "the succession of incidents is causing a form of frustration among the people, and sometimes anger".Christians, who make up around 10% of Egypt's population of 92 million, have long complained of marginalisation in the Muslim-majority country.Egypt has the largest Christian community of the Middle East.While most of Egypt's Christians are Coptic Orthodox, Roman Catholics have also lived in the country since the fifth century.'Peaceful coexistence'&nbsp;Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Catholic orders in Egypt - Franciscans, Dominicans, Jesuits - developed a network of schools, hospitals and charitable activities.
