"We do not accept that Senegal can be turned into a plaything. Macky Sall must return to reason," Fadel Barro, co-founder of the "Fed Up" youth movement which organised the rally, told the crowd.He denounced the "numerous imprisonments" of the president's opponents and urged young people to register ahead of legislative elections to be held July 30.Senegal is widely seen as one of Africa's most stable democracies.But accusations of corruption have hit the brother of President Sall - who is unrelated to Khalifa Sall - and plagued ministers in the administration of former president Abdoulaye Wade.The "Fed Up" group was formed in 2012 to oppose Wade's bid for a controversial third consecutive term as president, which sparked deadly violence in Dakar.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
