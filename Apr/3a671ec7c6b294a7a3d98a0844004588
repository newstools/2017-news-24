Al-Sisi ratified it Thursday and the official Gazette carried the presidential ratification to the so-called Judiciary Commissions Amendments.Najia Bounaim, North Africa campaign director at Amnesty International, says: "This law has the potential to undermine the independence of the country's already beleaguered judiciary." The group had warned the president against ratifying it saying it would be a "setback to justice."Previously, the president only confirmed judges' choices of the heads of judicial bodies.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
