The call made in these messages can have unexpected consequences especially for our fragile economy, business and communities,&rdquo; spokesperson Donald Liphoko said in a statement on Monday.&nbsp; &nbsp;Government did not support civil disobedience and a select few infringing on the constitutional rights of the majority.&ldquo;When citizens take to the streets illegally, we often witness violence, destruction of property and lawlessness. These illegal protests do not possess the characteristics of strengthening democracy. Those found guilty of any form of violence will face the might of the law,&rdquo; Liphoko said.Call for Zuma's headThe message going around on social media reads:&nbsp; &ldquo;Every citizen, every city, everyone that cares about our country. Not because of the DA or any political party but because of South Africans. Do not go to work, or to school or do anything unless you&rsquo;re taking to the streets in protest.&ldquo;Block highways, stand with your communities, go to political houses, go to prayer meetings, arrange your own marches. Do whatever you can to make your voice heard.&rdquo;The message contains a call for Zuma&rsquo;s head.&ldquo;I will no longer be supporting corruption and the evil that has plagued our beautiful country. I will be joining a nationwide shutdown. On Friday the 7 April the people of South Africa, regardless of race, or political affiliation will stand up against Zuma &amp; every single other corrupt official. Together, South Africa will rise! #ZumaMustFall #SouthAfricaMustRise.&rdquo;Economy 'disturbed'Liphoko said such messages brought South Africa into disrepute, &ldquo;disturbed&rdquo; the economy and created the impression of disorder and fear.Liphoko said this after ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s downgraded South Africa&rsquo;s long-term foreign currency sovereign credit rating to speculative grade, or &ldquo;junk&rdquo; status, in the wake of Zuma&rsquo;s Cabinet reshuffle on Thursday night, during which he fired Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.&ldquo;Civil society organizations, business and society at large are encouraged to work with government in strengthening our democracy to create a better South Africa and contribute to a better and safer Africa,&rdquo; Liphoko said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
