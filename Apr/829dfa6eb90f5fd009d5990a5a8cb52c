If you want to debate, let us debate this meaning we have presented."It was "absolutely important that the economy of this country must be shared among all citizens of this country"."The gap must be closed. The wealth of this country must look after the citizens of this country," Zuma said.New Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba told reporters on Saturday that government's vision for a new economy would be implemented within Treasury's fiscal limits.Gigaba's predecessor Pravin Gordhan had reportedly come under pressure from Cabinet members to allocate spending to transformation programmes."The issue of radical economic transformation arises from a criticism that for quite a long time, the structure of the economy has not changed," Gigaba said.Government was criticised for not focusing on the "real" economy, for not industrialising and promoting entrepreneurship, particularly among blacks, he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
