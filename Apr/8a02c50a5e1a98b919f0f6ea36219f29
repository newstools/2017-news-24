Hichilema's lawyers had asked the court to throw out the treason charges.But magistrate Greenwell Malumani ruled that he did not have the power to dismiss treason charges which can only be handled by the High Court."The law does not place power in the subordinate court to quash the indictment. The motion to quash the treason charge is untenable," he told a packed court in Lusaka.Hichilema, 54, a wealthy self-made businessman, has been in custody since police raided his Lusaka home on April 11.He made a fifth bid for the Zambian presidency last year and has sought to challenge the legality of the most recent election which he narrowly lost to Lungu.That campaign was marked by clashes between supporters of Lungu's Patriotic Front (PF) party and Hichilema's UPND.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
