Development of the LLB qualification standard was developed by a working group of expert law academics, established by the CHE after consultation with Salda."The draft qualification standard was then published for public comment."Institutions were requested, as part of the national review, to identify any areas in their programmes which, currently, do not meet the standard, and to indicate plans for improvement together with proposed timelines for implementation."EvaluationThe national review included all LLB programmes whether first-degree integrated programmes or second-degree programmes following a BA (Law), BCom (Law), etc.Institutions were given an opportunity to make representations within 21 days of receipt of the draft report and additional evidence was provided to support claims already made, clarify existing claims, but not used to introduce new claims.The final decision on the matter was made on March 30.Universities that met the standard include:"All improvement plans and progress reports received will be evaluated and the HEQC [Higher Education Quality Committee] may, at its discretion and for good reason, request follow-up site visits," the council said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
