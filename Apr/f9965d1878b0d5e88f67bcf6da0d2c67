If he has nothing to hide, he should have no issue with providing IPID with the information they require in a bid to clear his name," Mbhele said.It was vital for Phahlane to be beyond reproach and he should give his full cooperation to the investigators."The SAPS cannot afford to be shaken by more uncertainty in its senior ranks and it is imperative that South Africans are able to trust that SAPS leadership is fit and proper.Police Minister Fikile Mbalula needed to show he was serious about leading the fight against crime and protecting South Africans by suspending Phahlane pending the outcome of the IPID&rsquo;s investigation, he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
