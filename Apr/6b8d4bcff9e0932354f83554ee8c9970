Hyderbad - Officials say that at least 20 people have been killed and several others seriously injured after a truck driver lost control and ploughed into a group of protesting farmers in southern India. G Srinivas, a top government official in Andhra Pradesh's Chittoor district, says the truck first hit a car and an electricity pole before crashing into the farmers. The farmers were gathered outside the main police station in the town of Yerpedu protesting against illegal sand mining in their area.
