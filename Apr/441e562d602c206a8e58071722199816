I spent the best years of my life working for justice and democracy in SA, in a number of organisations including the Black Sash. I'm saddened at what has become of the ANC.&nbsp; The old leaders - Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Oliver Tambo, Govan Mbeki etc were an inspiration.&nbsp; The current leaders are a disgrace.&nbsp; Only a miracle can save SA from the ruthless greed of Zuma and his cohorts. May these protests be the start of that miracle." - writes News24 reader Dawn Ingle#SAUnites The crowd is growimg as more people arrive at SaveSA's meeting point at Church Square ahead if march to Union Buildings @News24 pic.twitter.com/Cm2xHC7o3m#saunites #ZumaMustFall pic.twitter.com/KdLEOMgeWk@News24 @SakinaKamwendo This how was are doing it...Together. #SAUnites #ProudlySA #LittleLeadersPreschool pic.twitter.com/IL31Ghm291 Jump to top
