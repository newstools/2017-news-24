The struggle hero was, Goldberg says, weak and pale, struggling to walk, and showing signs of being confused.&ldquo;He seemed to be having difficulty focusing. I was told that he had fallen and bumped his head, which seemed to have affected his cognitive ability,&rdquo; Goldberg says.&ldquo;I knew then that we would soon be hearing bad news.&rdquo;About seven weeks after their meeting at the prison, where the 27th anniversary of former president Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s historic release from the facility was marked, Goldberg&rsquo;s fears came true. Kathrada, one of the three remaining Rivonia Trialists, had died.Goldberg, 83, says he was shattered when he heard the news.&ldquo;His death made me aware of my age. I am one of the two remaining Rivonia Trialists and the youngest of all of them, but I am not young and I know that soon I will follow,&rdquo; he says.The thought of leaving this world gives Goldberg anxiety. But there is some consolation: &ldquo;I know that when I arrive on the other side, my comrade will be waiting for me.&rdquo;South Africa has lost a great man in Kathrada, he says. &ldquo;His wisdom will be missed in the ANC, which is in desperate need of a renewal of leadership,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;I will miss Kathy and his humour. He always saw me as child among the Rivonia Trialists and used every opportunity to remind me of that.&ldquo;When I turned 80, he said to me: &lsquo;You know you are still a baby, maybe you should apply for a social grant because your parents are no longer here to take care of you.&rsquo; I laughed.&rdquo;Goldberg and the other Rivonia Trialists played a major role in the liberation of South Africa. He says that, while this freedom was attained, South Africans must never forget that this was just the beginning of their emancipation.&ldquo;We should use the legacy left by Kathrada and the other stalwarts to achieve what we dreamt about when we involved ourselves in the liberation struggle. "Kathrada wanted a South Africa that is nonracial, treats people with dignity, and has leaders who lead with integrity and uphold the Constitution,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;Let us fulfil Kathrada&rsquo;s dream and build a South Africa that we can all be proud of.&rdquo; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
