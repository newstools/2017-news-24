Pupils from all three schools [Vhafamadi Secondary School, Vhudzani Secondary School and Mphagame Primary School] were further encouraged to focus on their studies, as education is useful ammunition to help South Africa become a better country,&rdquo; Mhaga said.The case against six Vuwani community leaders, accused of leading the violent protests, was struck off the roll in the local magistrates court on Monday.Magistrate Baldwin Ntsane rejected the State&rsquo;s request for more time to complete investigations, saying police had had enough time and resources to investigate the matter.The accused included former councillor Gideon Tshavhuyo, and a schoolteacher, who faced charges of arson and malicious damage to property.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
