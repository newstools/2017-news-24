The meetings were concluded on December 31," Ghandour told reporters.The head of Sudan's powerful National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS), Mohammed Atta al-Mawla, told reporters he had met the CIA chief "twice since October 2015".Sudan, he said, "has been cooperating and coordinating with the US since before 2000 in the struggle against terrorism," he said.Mawla did not elaborate but said he had received "technical assistance" from the US.The US decision to ease sanctions will allow Sudan to boost trade and "opens the way for us to use all sorts of currency, specially the US dollar", for trade transactions, according to Finance Minister Badreddin Mahmud.Sudan has been subject to a US trade embargo since 1997 for its alleged support for Islamist groups.
