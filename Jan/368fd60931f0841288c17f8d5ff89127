They are scuppering all of our efforts to bring down water usage," said Limberg.In the meantime, water restrictions may become stricter.If Level 3B water restrictions are implemented, residents will only be allowed to water their gardens on Tuesdays and Saturdays before 09:00 or after 18:00 with a bucket or watering can.This is grim compared to the current Level 3 water restrictions which do not limit residents to watering their gardens during certain times.Residents will also have to wait for 48 hours before they water their gardens after rainfall, as opposed to the current 24 hours, and they won't be allowed to wash their boats or vehicles at all, even with a bucket or watering can.If council approves this suggestion, it will be implemented from February 1, 2017. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
