Riyadh has already backtracked on one of the deals it signed in April without offering an explanation, with the oil giant Saudi Aramco suspending monthly deliveries of 700 000 tons of petroleum products to Egypt since October.The suspension came a few days after Egypt voted in favour of a Russian-drafted UN Security Council resolution on Syria that Riyadh strongly opposed.Economist Ibrahim al-Ghitani says Egyptian authorities are aware of their vulnerability, and have begun to seek alternative backers."The Egyptian government has already begun to seek an alternative in this area: an agreement has been reached with Kuwait, and negotiations with Iraq have reached a very advanced stage," Ghitani says.In another possible sign of tensions, a Saudi delegation in December visited a massive hydroelectric dam being built on the Nile in Ethiopia - a project which seriously worries Egypt as the river provides more than 90% of its water."The idea that we can count on Saudi Arabia as an economic partner for Egypt has started to fade," Ghitani says.It is unclear how concerned officials are in Riyadh following the latest ruling. Anwar Eshki, a retired Saudi general and founder of the independent Middle East Centre for Strategic and Legal Studies in Jeddah, says there is "no problem between Saudi Arabia and Egypt" about the decision."This is an internal affair," he says, describing the court battles as a reflection of domestic Egyptian struggles.In Tuesday's edition of Saudi Arabia's Arab News, editor-in-chief Faisal Abbas also played down the dispute, saying that contrary "to some local media", Saudi Arabia "remains one of Egypt's biggest allies"."The issue of Tiran and Sanafir will pass sooner or later," he wrote.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
