Watch. WATCHCape Town - Illegal street racing has declined by nearly 10% over the last year as a result of the traffic services&rsquo; Ghost Squad, the City of Cape Town said in a statement on Monday.The number of offences recorded during operations by the Ghost Squad fell from 29 093 in 2015 to 26 977 in 2016, mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith said.They were still struggling with people who were turning public roads into a &ldquo;very dangerous playground&rdquo;.Illegal street racers were arrested for offences including reckless or negligent driving, drunk driving, and unlicensed driving.Hotspots included Ottery, Athlone, Grassy Park, Belhar, and Bellville South.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit of a cat-and-mouse game, because they change locations regularly as well as the days of the week to try and throw us off, but our officers stay on the prowl and are usually able to spoil the party,&rdquo; said Smith.Many of the illegal racers were minors who used their parents&rsquo; cars without permission. In other cases, minors were brought along as passengers.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
