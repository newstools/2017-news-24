He also lambasted the department's attitude on the non-filling of promotional posts and the non-payment of teachers' benefits. Raphasha said the department's attitude was provocative and that the union would not hesitate to start protests."The boardroom has clearly failed to resolve the issue we have raised."Provincial education department spokesperson Naledzani Rasila told News24 that the process to renew contracts was underway.However, he added: "Some educators' contracts will not be renewed because of their status with home affairs."Rasila said a management post would also be filled."We are waiting for Treasury to approve the post," he said.But Raphasha said the department failed to fill posts as far back as 2015, adding that it was a sign of ignorance and an unwillingness to resolve the issue.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
