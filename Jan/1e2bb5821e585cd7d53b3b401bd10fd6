Quick action by the police in Rondebosch led to the arrest of two people for robbing a woman and stealing her car.Three men accosted a 21-year-old woman as she stopped in front of her home in Coniston Road on Monday 10 January at about 12:30. After threatening her they robbed her and sped off in her car.Police responded quickly and were told that she was able to track her iPad tablet, which had also been stolen in the incident.Station commander Lieutenant-Colonel Barbara Breedt says it was the quick response and orders to track and follow the car that led to the arrest. While the victim was giving constant location changes of her stolen car, it led them into Gugulethu, she says. Police who were tracking the car then spotted it driving towards them in NY137 and gave chase as it attempted to drive away. It was eventually stopped and the suspects tried to run away but were quickly in police custody. Two suspects, aged 28 and 42 years, both from Gugulethu were arrested and the property of the victim was recovered. This is once again evidence of how technology is used to help with the fight against crime. The community is advised to download the tracking apps on their electronic devices, says Breedt.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
