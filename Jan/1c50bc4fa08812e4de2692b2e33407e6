See how lekker [nice] it is to smoke. Don&rsquo;t you want to have a taste?" he allegedly told her, York said.Just after she had taken a puff, he said: "If you tell anyone what I&rsquo;m going to do to you now, I&rsquo;ll tell them you smoke."York said this was a well known ploy to groom a child for abuse.&nbsp;"I want a secret friend again. You&rsquo;re not allowed to tell anyone about what happened to you, otherwise I will find myself behind bars," he allegedly told her.Kleinhans and his 36-year-old fianc&eacute;, Zelda Dreyer, are charged with raping the girl and her cousin between 2007 and 2012.
