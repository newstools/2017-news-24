She also announced that the city had been divided into four geographical areas - with four "mini mayors" overseeing these.READ: De Lille to announce new mayoral committee for Cape Town'Mini mayors'The Mayoral Committee Members responsible for portfolios will be:The four area-based Mayoral Committee Members, or "mini mayors", will be:The four area-based geographical locations are:20% renewable energy"All mayoral committee members will also have a community liaison officer to strengthen community engagement. Before rolling out new services or starting any project, the community liaison officer will be responsible for consultation with the beneficiary community. They will set up meetings and do in-depth briefings with the community&rsquo;s elected leaders," said De Lille."We are doing this so that communities can be better informed about the plans for their area and to avoid unnecessary community conflict that could hinder the delivery of services and projects."The retention of Smith came after speculation that he was about to be removed.The city would also work toward certain projects through the MMCs, such as having 20% renewable energy as part of the its overall energy mix by 2020.The area councillors would be the face of the city, and would be assisted by liaison officers who would make sure that all of the city's messages got through to communities.Former finance MMC Ian Nielsen has been made deputy mayor.
