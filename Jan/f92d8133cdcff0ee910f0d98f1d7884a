That is, the donkeys appear to have been 'immobilised' with an instrument, then skinned, probably whilst still conscious. Death would have been slow and excruciatingly painful.&rdquo;Investigations were ongoing.There were reports of more donkeys in the area which may be at risk. However, officials had failed to find them in the vast and mountainous area over several days.De Lange said it was clear that the demand for donkey skins, supposedly for medical purposes, continued in the country. It seemed to have spread to rural areas, possibly even Lesotho.NSPCA officials had met local and Lesotho officials to make them aware of the situation.The pair would return to court on animal cruelty charges on February 6.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
