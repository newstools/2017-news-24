The decision to move the patients was not properly planned.READ: Health ombud to release report into the death of mentally ill patientsIn the draft report, according to The Sowetan, questions are raised about Mahlangu&rsquo;s suitability to stay in her job.DA Gauteng shadow MEC for health, Jack Bloom, said Mahlangu should have resigned or been fired long ago for what he called her &ldquo;inexcusable neglect&rdquo;.&ldquo;It was abundantly clear from the start that the Health MEC had bungled the transfer of patients which led to avoidable deaths.&rdquo;He hoped action would be taken against implicated parties.Makgoba on Tuesday said he would not comment on the report until its release on Wednesday.Makgoba handed a draft interim report to Mahlangu on January 6. She undertook to provide him with feedback by Friday, January 13, he said. That evening, he received a letter from her, asking for an extension. Makgoba granted her one until Tuesday, January 24.Mahlangu&rsquo;s spokesperson Steve Mabona declined to comment.
