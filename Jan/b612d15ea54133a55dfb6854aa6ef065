"We expect a limited economic recovery in 2017, with growth of 1.5%, well below the 2011-15 annual growth average of 4.8%," the ratings agency continued.Falling global oil prices and repeated attacks on crude infrastructure in Nigeria's south severely hit the country's economy in 2016, hammering the naira currency against the dollar.Nigeria, which gets over 70% of its revenue from oil, is now suffering from a debilitating shortage of foreign exchange, hitting imports and overseas investment. While the official rate is around 305 naira to the dollar, many Nigerian businesses are being forced to buy dollars on the black market, where the rate is upwards of 490 to the dollar. Fitch said that Nigeria would continue to suffer low growth if foreign exchange continued to be in short supply and if the government could not narrow the fiscal deficit. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
