"We are now only left with the Ecowas mediation initiative and the inter-party committee set up by government to resolve the dispute," he said.The leaders from the Ecowas regional grouping led by Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari will return to The Gambia for the second time since the election on Wednesday to attempt a diplomatic solution, but Nigeria's foreign minister has said the use of force remains an option.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
