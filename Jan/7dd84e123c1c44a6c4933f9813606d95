Vukani did extremely well, he got 99% in accounting and 96% in maths&hellip;"Dube said he had used the same strategy in 2015, which compels all matric pupils to start their school day at 06:00 and end at 18:00.He developed the programme called the 6-4-6 turnaround strategy for his Grade 12 pupils in a bid to improve the matric results at the school.Learners are required to be in class from 06:00 until 14:00, take a break until 16:00, and then return to class until 18:00.'Start working hard from day one'Both Khumalo, 18, and Dlamini, 17, said it was Dube and the teachers&rsquo; commitment to the programme that had pushed them to work harder.Khumalo, from&nbsp;Oliviershoek in Bergville, said he had been accepted at the University of Stellenbosch to study actuarial science.He has applied for assistance from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme and for bursaries and was still waiting to hear from the various organisations.Khumalo, the eldest of three siblings being raised by an unemployed mother, said: "Lindo set the bar very high last year by receiving 9 As. I did eight subjects and only received seven distinctions. We worked hard with Sifundo and other pupils."To the class of 2017, he said: "Start working hard from day one of your matric year. Don&rsquo;t wait for the third term, because that is when you panic."He said there was nothing wrong with a little &ldquo;healthy collaboration&rdquo; when asked if he and Dlamini were competing."We worked well together. She was like my little sister," he said.Dlamini, from eMazizini in Obonjaneni in Bergville, said she could not believe that she had obtained seven distinctions."I wanted to study medicine, but I did not apply because I did not believe that I would be able to get the marks needed to qualify. But I have been accepted to study chemical engineering at the University of Witwatersrand."'It was all worth it'She too had applied for assistance from NSFAS and was waiting for an answer.When asked how her matric year was, she said: "It was difficult because I had to move away from home and live with a family that lived closer to the school."She said the school was a 30-minute drive from her home."Our teachers kept their doors open at school and their homes and we could ask for help anytime. We are so grateful for the time they invested in us.&rdquo;Despite Dube&rsquo;s hard efforts, neither he nor his pupils were invited to a grand ceremony held at the Durban ICC on Thursday, where KwaZulu-Natal MEC Mthandeni Dlugwana, and other senior government officials announced the 66.4% provincial pass rate.The province&rsquo;s top achievers were also honoured at the ceremony."I even doubted that the awards ceremony was taking place yesterday. My school was not invited to the event, but it is okay. We [he and the teachers] are doing all of this for the children," he said.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
