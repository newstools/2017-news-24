"There won't be anything because there is nothing."Political campaignIsrael's Channel 2 TV has reported that Netanyahu accepted "favours" from businessmen in Israel and abroad, and that he is the central suspect in a second investigation that also involves family members.The Haaretz daily said that billionaire Ronald Lauder, a long-time friend of Netanyahu's, was linked to the affair.Channel 10 TV has reported that Netanyahu's oldest son, Yair, accepted free trips and other gifts from Australian billionaire James Packer.In October, Lauder was summoned by police for questioning "related to a certain investigation conducted by them and in which Mr Lauder is not its subject matter", said Helena Beilin, Lauder's Israeli attorney. "After a short meeting, he was told that his presence is no longer required and that there shall be no further need for additional meetings."Israel's Justice Ministry and police have declined to comment on the media reports.A campaign is underway by Erel Margalit, an opposition lawmaker of the Zionist Union party, for Netanyahu to be formally investigated over suspicions of prominent donors improperly transferring money for Netanyahu's personal use, as well as reports that Netanyahu's personal attorney represented a German firm involved in a $1.5bn sale of submarines to Israel.The prime minister has long been saddled with an image as a cigar-smoking, cognac-drinking socialite, while his wife Sara has been accused of abusive behaviour toward staff. Opponents have portrayed both as being out of touch with the struggles of average Israelis.Over the years, reports have been released about the high cost of the Netanyahus' housekeeping expenses.In one case, the premier was chided for spending $127 000 in public funds for a special sleeping cabin on a flight to London. Even their costly purchases of scented candles and pistachio-flavoured ice cream have been derided.The Netanyahus have denied any wrongdoing, and say they are the target of a witch hunt by the Israeli media. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
