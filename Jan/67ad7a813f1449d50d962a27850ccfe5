She wanted to raise the baby as her own, because her parents were struggling to raise her.She was arrested on December 12 2013 for illegally bringing the baby girl into SA.&ldquo;But I did it for the sole purpose of raising the child in a healthy and successful environment and to create a better future for her,&rdquo; Ndlovu said.Joubert said the court was satisfied that she pleaded guilty and accepted responsibility for the crime.A minimum 10-year jail sentence was imposed for human trafficking. In the case of human trafficking for sexual purposes, the minimum sentence was life, Joubert said.She agreed with her defence&rsquo;s request to impose a suspended sentence because she did not mean to harm the child.Normally, people convicted of violating children&rsquo;s rights were declared unfit to work with children. Ndlovu did not pose a danger to children and Joubert said she would not take away this right.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
