A civilian resident in the nearby Miringa village said the Kamuya assault was carried out by fighters from the Al-Barnawi faction who are known to be hiding in the area's Ajigin forest.Umar Sanda told AFP that Ajigin forest was the bastion of the Al-Barnawi fighters and that "they are responsible for most of the attacks in the area including the one in Kamuya."He added that the residents have repeatedly told the soldiers that "Ajigin is the hideout of Boko Haram in the area and as long as they are not dislodged there will no end to their attacks."Boko Haram, which has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, has been in the grip of a power struggle. One faction is led by Abu Musab al-Barnawi, the 22-year-old son of Boko Haram's founder Mohammed Yusuf, who was named leader by the ISIS high command in August.Villages in the area have been razed and plundered in deadly raids by Boko Haram since Tukur Buratai became Nigerian army chief in June 2015.The attacks are believed to be reprisals over the successes by the Nigerian troops who have pushed Boko Haram from swathes of Nigerian territory they had seized in their bid to carve out an Islamic Caliphate.The military campaign which succeeded in substantually cutting off Boko Haram's food, fuel and weapons supplies has also seen Boko Haram losing its Sambisa forest stronghold to Nigerian forces.Boko Haram violence is estimated to have killed 20 000 people and displaced 2.6 million since the start of its insurgency in 2009.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
