Reports from the scene however indicate that a voluntary lifeguard was competing in the Natal championships. He went out on a surf ski and was flipped over in the wave, with his foot stuck in one of the straps the waves continued to toss him and the ski around in the surf. The man was taken from the water by fellow lifeguards who need to be commended for the way they removed him to prevent any further injuries, said Botha. The patient was found in the first aid room with serious injuries and symptoms of near drowning. The patient was stabilised by the Netcare 911 Advanced Life Support paramedic and his team before they transported him to a specialised hospital in Durban. - Supplied.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
