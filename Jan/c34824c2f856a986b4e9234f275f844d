He declined to comment on the matter."I first need to familiarise myself with the letter then I will be able to give comment," Barnard said.Fees Must Fall movement leader at the university Naledi Chirwa told News24 that the letter was unconstitutional, and that it was a violation of students' rights."The university is going back on their word and everything they promised us. The letter is not surprising at all, the university wants us to act and we will," she said.Higher education director-general Gwebinkundla Qonde declined to comment on whether the letter was unconstitutional but said each institution had the right to take action based on its own code of conduct and codes of practice."An action is taken against anyone if the person has transgressed the code of conduct and code of practice [of that institution]. If the university has the facts, they can take such action."In the context in which they try and execute their responsibility, criminal cases are dealt with as criminal cases," Qonde said.The university was at liberty to execute its responsibilities and duties within the context of those codes over and above a legislative framework which was within the law, he added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
