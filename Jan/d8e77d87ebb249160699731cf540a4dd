The lawyer asked the court to prevent Barrow's planned inauguration for January 19 until the legal case had been settled, according to a document seen by AFP. But the Gambia's chief Supreme Court justice said this week the challenge could not be heard for several months as it did not have a full bench, and the extra judges needed to hear the case were not available.'The winner should prepare for inauguration'&nbsp;The Gambia relies on foreign judges, notably from Nigeria, to staff its courts due to a lack of trained professionals in the tiny West African state.In response to the injunction request, Barrow's office said in a statement that Jammeh could not exceed his five-year mandate, which expires on January 18.
