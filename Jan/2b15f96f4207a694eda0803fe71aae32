For 2017, the UN appeal has doubled to $1.5bn.US Ambassador Samantha Power, who visited the region in April last year and will step down next week, described the crisis as "extreme" and said a council visit would draw global attention to the humanitarian emergency.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
