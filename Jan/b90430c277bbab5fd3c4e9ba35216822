After the protest, officials visited the school but nothing was done.&ldquo;This is a serious crisis that we are facing as teachers and it&rsquo;s even worse for students,&rdquo; he said.School governing body member Bakhokele Ndamase said there had been no communication from the department.Middle Zolo High in Nqamakhwe, in the Cofimvaba district, also needed teachers. In 2016 not a single matriculant passed. Teachers said there had been a shortage of teachers for 10 years and the department was aware of it.Vukile Tshwete High, outside King William&rsquo;s Town, had been struggling to get a Physical Science and Maths teacher. Last year, parents hired their own teacher, but only managed to pay him for a few months.SA Democratic Teachers&rsquo; Union (Sadtu) Eastern Cape spokesperson Sindisile Zamisa said the shortage was a crisis in a number of schools in the Eastern Cape.He said Sadtu had written to the ANC, Cosatu, the SACP, and the chairperson of the portfolio committee on education in the Eastern Cape government to convene an urgent education crisis meeting.&ldquo;We shall decide on our next move which some people might not like. But the honeymoon is over for lazy officials in this department,&rdquo; he said.Department spokesperson Malibongwe Mtima said officials had been sent to these schools to investigate.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
