They were being fed the rotten chicken meat.Willson said inspectors were appalled by what they found.&ldquo;The dogs were tick, flea and worm infested and many of them had untreated injuries as well as other conditions and illnesses.&rdquo;Two sheep were put down on veterinary advice due to their extreme suffering from untreated injuries and illnesses. Inspectors had to break the locks of an outhouse to reach them.The &ldquo;abattoirs&rdquo; on the property were unregistered and operating illegally. Inspectors found dead and dying chickens being processed in filthy conditions.&ldquo;Information obtained at the scene revealed that the chickens were for sale to the unsuspecting public in Johannesburg. It was also of great concern that women and children were living between the slaughterhouse buildings among the abattoir waste,&rdquo; said Willson.In addition, many cannabis plants were being cultivated on the property.
