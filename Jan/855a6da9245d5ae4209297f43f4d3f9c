The team is due to give Contralesa's national general council feedback in October 2017.Thobejane accused the current government of perpetuating the legacy of the apartheid-era government."I am earning a salary, as a member of Parliament. That salary doesn't bring happiness to me. It continues to torture me. I feel what I am doing is not right to my people," said Thobejane.He said he could no longer sit in a Parliament that supported the Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act and that had passed the National Development Plan.'Seven kings, only one gets a budget'"The NDP says, 30 years after it's been adopted, it wants to see South Africa totally urbanised. There will be no space for traditional leadership, yet I am a part of that," he said.Thobejane said he took the decision as he could no longer deceive himself."Whenever I go back home, I feel the pain of seeing our people continue to suffer in the manner that they continue to suffer. I am saying, I am going to join my people, fight with them, struggle with them for the economy to grow in order to fit what we need," said Thobejane.The former ANC MP said he found no peace leading a fight against some of ANC's policies while serving the party in the National Assembly."I thought I must quit there, come back to Contralesa, look at better strategy and tactics to better the lives of South Africans," he said.Traditional leaders have previously locked horns with the ANC over jailed AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, asking for President Jacob Zuma to pardon him.Thobejane said kings needed to be treated equally in the country."There are seven recognised kings, but only one gets a budget," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
