The quarantine may only be lifted by the state veterinarian director or the director for animal health," Manankong said.The disease is caused by a virus transmitted by midges. Clinical signs in horses include difficulty breathing, swelling of the head, foaming from the nose and the sudden death of the animal, Manankong said."The department is advising horse owners to take precautions that include protecting horses from being bitten by midges and treating them with registered products for this purpose. Horses can be kept indoors until the sun is well up and be put into the stable before the sun sets and the midges become active."All horse owners are by law required to annually vaccinate their horses against the sickness. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
