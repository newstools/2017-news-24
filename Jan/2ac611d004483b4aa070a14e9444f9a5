This raised tensions between the two countries and the Ethiopian Prime Minister recently charged that "some elements within the Egyptian government" are supporting the unrest in his country.Despite the tensions between Ethiopia and Egypt, South Sudan wants to have good relations with both, said Morgan.Tewolde Mulugeta, spokesperson for the Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, agreed with the ambassador's remarks saying that South Sudan and Ethiopia enjoy good relations.Ethiopia currently hosts close to 300 000 South Sudanese refugees, most of whom fled after conflict broke out in the world's newest nation in December 2013, according to UN estimates.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
