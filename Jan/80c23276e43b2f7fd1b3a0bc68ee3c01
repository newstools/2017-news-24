Troll hunting pic.twitter.com/LM8ld9V4KtShe said the shenanigans started after her feature article "4 days in December - the year of State Capture" was published.The report traced the history of claims that the Gupta family may have had a hand in some of President Jacob Zuma's ministerial appointments following the release of the Public Protector's report State of Capture on the allegations.Oakbay Investments also owns The New Age newspaper and television channel ANN7.The accounts were marked as "parody", which gives the creators a degree of protection in terms of Twitter's take-down policies, but victims can also complain about impersonation.Intellectual propertySouth Africans are not new to parody accounts, with Oscar Pistorius' lawyer Barry Roux (@Barry_Roux) and ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe (@GwedeUncle) among those whose names have been used in accounts that poke fun at current affairs.The State of Capture report itself spawned the @StateShebeen account after a communications analysis contained in the report placed former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe's cellphone within range of the Guptas' estate in Saxonwold. Molefe was lampooned for suggesting he might have been visiting a shebeen and not necessarily the Guptas, sparking the creation of the account.However, there may be various intellectual property remedies for those targeted by the fake news tweets, such as trademark infringement, warned Dario Milo, partner at law firm Webber Wentzel."There could be an action for defamation if the fake publication harms the reputation of the real account holder," he explained."Also, for individuals there could be a privacy invasion where they are being portrayed in a false light. These will all be fact dependent."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
