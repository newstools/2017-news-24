Almost a year later former government minister and spokesperson Hafsa Mossi was killed by gunmen in her car.Other attacks have failed, with senior presidential advisor Willy Nyamitwe, a spokesperson widely regarded as the public face of the government, escaping an ambush by a group of gunmen as he returned to his Bujumbura home in November.Burundi has commonly blamed neighbouring Rwanda for the attacks.At least 500 people have been killed and 300 000 have fled the country since the unrest began as protesters - and then military coup-plotters - fought against Nkurunziza's third mandate.UN and NGO human rights reports have raised fears that Burundi's political crisis might take on an ethnic dimension, warning of the potential for genocide.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
