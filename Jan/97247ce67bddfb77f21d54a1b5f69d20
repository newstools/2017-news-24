Chicago - Local police say they have arrested four
people suspected of attacking and taunting a young Chicago man in a video
circulated on social media. In the video shared via Facebook Live on Wednesday,
four African-Americans are seen assaulting the duct-taped man, while yelling racially-charged obscenities. The man, who was described as mentally-disabled, was taken by the suspects
from a Chicago suburb to an area in the
southwestern side of the city, and was with them for 24 to 48 hours, police said. One of the suspects was a school acquaintance of
the victim, who is white, according to police. The suspects and the victim were said to be young
adults over 18 years old. In the video originally posted by one of the
arrested perpetrators, the suspects are seen laughing during the assault and
repeatedly yelling: "F*** Donald Trump! F*** white people!" The victim can be seen squatting in a corner with
his mouth duct-taped, and his hands and legs apparently tied up. His clothes
are partially cut at one point, he is threatened repeatedly, and a part of his
hair is cut down to his scalp causing a bleeding wound. "It's
sickening," Chicago police chief Eddie Johnson said at a news conference
announcing that the four suspects were being held pending formal charges.  Police had not yet
determined whether the incident constituted a hate crime or if there were
political motivations behind the attack.  Police were also still
trying to determine whether the victim was kidnapped, saying that he was
traumatised and was having difficulty communicating with investigators.  Authorities said the victim has been released from
a hospital.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
