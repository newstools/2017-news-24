The president of the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic, Brahim Ghali, paid a visit to President Jacob Zuma earlier this month to lobby his support on the matter.Ghali also attended the ANC's birthday celebrations.Zuma said it was "unfathomable" that the Western Sahara was still colonised by Morocco.Western Sahara is a disputed territory bordered by Morocco and Algeria and has been under de facto control by Morocco since 1991, backed by the United States and France.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
