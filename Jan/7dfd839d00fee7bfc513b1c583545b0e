"It shows that, if there is a will, it can be done."However, the department has indicated that the school must close because it is in such a serious state of disrepair. It said not even security guards could stop thieves carrying it off "brick by brick".READ: Fate of Cape Town's Uitsig High in the balance againNo-fee schoolEducation spokesperson Jessica Shelver said the guards that were posted at the school had been stoned and threatened.But Ehrenreich said there were 200 pupils left at the school, across the grades, and that their families were determined to keep it open, not only because they don't want their children walking in unsafe places, but because it is a no-fee school.Pupils have been transferring to Ravensmead High School at the department's recommendation.Ehrenreich said teachers were still present at the school, although this could not be independently confirmed, and that classes would continue on Thursday.Further comment from the department was not immediately available. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
