''They have been called from all over.''The worst-affected area was the suburb of Payne in Mthatha and in Mqanduli, south of Mthatha.Information on the full extent and reach of the calamity is being compiled but in the meantime, the municipality will start mobilising assistance for families left out in the cold after their houses were damaged.Last December six people were killed when lightning struck at Elliotdale outside Mthatha.Tarnado in Mthatha 7:59 Tarnado in Mthatha @Dispatch_DD @METROFMSA @WandileSihlobo pic.twitter.com/Cl73RT2T8724.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
