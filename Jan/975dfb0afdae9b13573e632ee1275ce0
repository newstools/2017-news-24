She continued: "Enough is enough. Africans deserve better, and we must all work towards better days, and towards peace, stability and development."Dlamini-Zuma's remarks came as reports on Wednesday said that the head of Gambia's electoral commission had fled to Senegal&nbsp;"fearing a plot against him". Alieu Momar Njie&rsquo;s relatives confirmed that he fled to Senegal "after he got information that the Gambian authorities were plotting against him and his team" after he declared on December 2 that Yahya Jammeh lost elections following 22 years in power.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
