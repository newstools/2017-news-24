Disciplinary proceedings have been pended provisionally, awaiting finalisation of the criminal matters," the letter read.Letters 'not a punitive measure'"In light of the above, the university management has to reconsider whether you should be allowed to register at the university for the 2017 academic year, subject to certain conditions and undertakings."SAUS secretary general Sthembiso Ndlovu said the organisation did not appreciate the way the university was handling the situation."We encourage students not to write those motivational letters. We made a promise that we are going to shut the university down and we are sticking to it," Ndlovu said.However, Jooste said a majority of the students had already made submissions, either in writing, or have engaged with university management in person, and had been allowed to register."This is not a punitive measure and the university is open to engaging with students."SRC president Henricho Barnard said it was of utmost importance that stability was restored at the university."The past year [2016], has had detrimental impact on students' studies, thus it is of utmost importance to restore stability on campus in order to ensure that the academic programme continues undisputed as all the students at the university are deserving of this opportunity," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
