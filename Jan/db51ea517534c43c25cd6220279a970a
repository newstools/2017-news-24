These are serious cases and we are under international obligation," MacAdam said.READ: Thulsie twins' arrest was lawful, court rulesJurisdiction issuesMacAdam said that the US also had jurisdiction over the case and that they had registered a local case and would subpoena service providers.He said senior British officials had met with the investigating officer to see what information was available in SA.The twins were arrested during raids in Newclare and Azaadville, on the West Rand, on July 9.They face three counts of contravening the Protection of Constitutional Democracy Against Terrorist and Related Activities Act.According to their charge sheet, the brothers, who were arrested along with siblings Ebrahim and Fatima Patel, were allegedly linked to the self-proclaimed Islamic State group.They were allegedly planning to set off explosives at a US embassy and "Jewish institutions" in SA.The investigating officer found that the twins had allegedly been active on social media prior to their arrests, allegedly discussing matters that could incriminate them.'Wishy-washy statement'The State also approached the Syrian and Turkish governments, because there was information that the twins wanted to join the fighting in Syria, MacAdam said.Their lawyer, Annelene van den Heever, argued that there had been an unreasonable delay in the case."These are nothing but speculation and the court cannot rely on a 'wishy-washy' statement. The court needs to rely on facts to grant a postponement," van den Heever said.Van den Heever said the State needed to tell the court how long it was going to take and what was needed."When these matters go across international borders, they are tied to protocols," Magistrate Pieter du Plessis told Van den Heever.The case was postponed to Friday.WATCH this video:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
