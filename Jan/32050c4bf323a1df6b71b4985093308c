We cannot allow a minority to frustrate our determination to provide our people with quality services," he said.The three-year project, which began in September 2015 and is funded by the Municipal Infrastructure Grant,&nbsp;involves building an access road that will link a shopping mall, a small town and four poverty-stricken villages.Problems started shortly before the local government elections in August, when the project reached Zanghoma village, after a group of residents protested against a decision to build the road through their village. The protesters wanted the tarred road to bypass the area and staged violent protests on the construction site, forcing the contractor to abandon the project. The court interdict, which was granted in October, prohibits 21 community leaders from organising demonstrations against the construction, or taking part in any activity that would hinder the building of the road.Ndlala said it was part of the municipality's infrastructural development plan to build access roads to all local villages."The tarred road is 60% complete. It will improve access to our villages and also create business opportunities for local entrepreneurs. We are happy that the majority of villagers support the project," he said.Local Induna Peter Nkhwashu accused the municipality of changing the scope and direction of the project without consulting the community. "We are not against development, but we want the municipality to implement the original decision to build a bypass road," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
