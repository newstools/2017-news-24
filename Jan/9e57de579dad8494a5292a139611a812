One user accused Nott on Facebook of having actually &ldquo;sabotaged&rdquo; the RMF movement&rsquo;s efforts.&nbsp;A former student and member of RMF and Decolonise UCT Law, who asked not to be named, told News24 on Monday night that Nott was definitely never part of the movement.&ldquo;He joined the protest immediately in 2015 and was kicked out,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;He made quite inflammatory comments. His position deviated from the politics of RMF.&rdquo;She said the scholarship was not a surprise; rather it was &ldquo;expected of him&rdquo; in the context of privilege and opportunism.The Rhodes House website describes Nott as a young South African, &ldquo;dedicated to South Africa&rsquo;s Constitutional imperatives&rdquo;. It makes no mention of his involvement with the RMF movement.Instead, it says he is &ldquo;keenly interested in social justice and has pioneered a number of workers&rsquo; rights and student focused initiatives.&rdquo;His online CV states his former positions at the South African Students&rsquo; Congress and the Black Law Students&rsquo; Forum. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
