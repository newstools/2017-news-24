He joined the league at age 14 and was the youngest member of its Western Cape executive committee, he told MPs.He said the NYDA had been faced with an identity crisis due to the fact that some had come to see it as extension of a &ldquo;particular youth formation&rdquo;.&ldquo;But I must say, over the last two years or so, the agency began to go into the right footing.
