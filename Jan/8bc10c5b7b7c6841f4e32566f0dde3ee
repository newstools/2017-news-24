It&rsquo;s actually a code or safe word for women,&rdquo; said Roger Masson, Hooters&rsquo; marketing manager.Hooters put up a discreet note about the &ldquo;Angel Shot&rdquo; in the ladies restrooms over the past week.Patrons were so impressed that it had been widely shared on social media by Wednesday.&nbsp;&ldquo;Someone saw the idea overseas and sent it to us via Twitter. We tweaked it for our own customers.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not meant for girls whose date has turned sour, but for women who find themselves in a situation where they need help.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The safe word will also be changed regularly to something which isn&rsquo;t on our menu, so that a woman can sound the alarm with as little fuss as possible.&ldquo;Our staff will help discreetly where they can,&rdquo; said Masson.Safety netThe notice, with an image of a big-eyed owl, has been put in the ladies&rsquo; rooms in all the Hooters branches in South Africa.&ldquo;First prize, of course, is that a woman never needs to use the code word and, until now, there have been no incidents where someone has had to resort to the safe word. However, it is a safety net should such a situation arise.&rdquo;One of the people who has praised the campaign on social media was Renaldo Gouws. He had gone a meet a friend who works at Hooters in Port Elizabeth.&nbsp;&ldquo;I am a DA councillor in that area, so I regularly stop at places in my ward to see how things are going.&ldquo;Someone showed me the pamphlet and we decided that it was such a good idea that women have to be made aware of it.&rdquo;Gouws does not think the attention it elicited on social media would be detrimental to the project as the code word will be changed regularly.&ldquo;This is such a good idea to keep women safe that I think it should be done all over the world,&rdquo; Gouws said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
