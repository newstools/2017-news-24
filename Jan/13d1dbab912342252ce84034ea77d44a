All the positions in the commission are open and because regional considerations play an over-arching role, there will be a lot of horse-trading to ensure fair distribution in all these positions, right through to the top.This is how things stood for the chairperson candidates on Friday morning:Kenyan foreign minister Amina MohamedStrength: Kenya ran a very strong campaign for her across the continent, and being a leader on issues like calling for African countries to leave the International Criminal Court has won Kenya strong trust amongst like-minded countries. Even though South Africa should officially support the candidate from southern Africa, unofficial talk is that President Jacob Zuma will vote for her when it matters.Weakness: Kenya&rsquo;s Erastus Mwencha has served as deputy AU Commission chairperson for two terms, and many countries feel that Kenya has had its turn at the top of the AU for now.Senegal&rsquo;s Abdoulaye Bathily, former United Nations special envoy for Central Africa and former ministerStrength: Bathily is fluent in English and French and considered to be a pan-Africanist who can bridge the divide between Francophone and Anglophone Africa.Weakness: Many countries, especially in the anglophone bloc, dislike Senegal&rsquo;s support of Morocco to be readmitted to the AU &ndash; a very hot issue at this year&rsquo;s summit.Chad foreign minister and former prime minister, Moussa Faki MahamatStrength: Talk in Addis is that he&rsquo;s one of the frontrunners for the position as a veteran statesman and diplomat and pan-Africanist.Weakness: If countries vote strictly according to regional alliances in the first round of voting, Equatorial Guinea&rsquo;s Agapito Mba Mokuy could split the central African vote and he could face early elimination.Botswana foreign minister Pelonomi Venson-MoitoiStrength: Venson-Moitoi ran for the position during the AU&rsquo;s Kigali summit in July but failed to get two-thirds of the vote. She might, however, emerge as a compromise candidate if the contest around the others turns out to be too fierce.Weakness: Botswana&rsquo;s president Ian Khama does not attend AU summits, which has bred resentment amongst fellow African heads of state.Equatorial Guinea foreign minister Agapito Mba MokuyStrength: Like Venson-Moitoi, he was a contender for the position at the Kigali summit and has had a lot more time to campaign. Weakness: Mokuy is considered the least likely candidate to get elected, because in Kigali he mustered even fewer votes than Venson-Moitoi. The elections in Kigali were abandoned because none of the candidates was strong enough to muster two-thirds of the vote.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
