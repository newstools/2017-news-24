They can't simply use institutional autonomy," said Kekana.The act comes as students and universities prepare for the new academic year, following two years of robust Fees Must Fall protests which have challenged the way higher education is funded, as well as the language policies of some universities.Kekana said that giving the minister of higher education greater powers was overdue because it was no longer enough to expect the institutions' councils to fix problems."When something goes wrong, people don't turn to the [university] council, they turn to the government," said Kekana.It would also make institutions more Afrocentric in their curriculum, without rejecting international academic work and discoveries.The amendments also allow the minister to declare new public institutions, and to confer higher learning status on institutions that are not necessarily classified as universities, but are providing more expanded studies.It also allows the minister to issue ministerial directives.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
