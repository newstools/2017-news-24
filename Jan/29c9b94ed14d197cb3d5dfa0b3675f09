The case is due to be heard on January 10.Three other radio stations have been ordered off air in similar circumstances so far in January, with only one of them - Afri Radio - later allowed to continue broadcasts on the condition it plays only music.Jammeh is regularly accused of rights abuses and repression of the media.The Gambia ranked 145 out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders' 2016 World Press Freedom Index, pointing to "a climate of terror around anything remotely to do with journalism".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
