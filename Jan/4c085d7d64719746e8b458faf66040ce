So this provocation is here to make you feel that 'white pain'," Hutton&rsquo;s description of the artwork reads."Earlier this year, I photographed a student Zama Mthunzi wearing a T-shirt with the words 'fuck white people' smeared in black paint. He was threatened with expulsion and a case at the human rights commission. None of the complaints said anything about the front of the T-shirt which read 'black pain is shit'," Hutton said.Hutton told News24 later that the exhibition would open white people&rsquo;s eyes to indoctrination.&ldquo;I am sure that many, and in particular the young people in your communities, have begun to wake from&nbsp;the indoctrination of white supremacy and are ready to learn to fuck the white in them too,&rdquo; Hutton said.According to Hutton, reverse racism does not exist.&ldquo;I would like to remind the good doctor that the reverse of racism is love, and celebration of difference. 'Reverse Racism' is a fantasy of white people who are keen to experience the kinds of oppression that they have used against indigenous people of this country,&rdquo; Hutton said.Social media reactionOn the FF Plus Facebook page, commentators expressed their frustration with the artwork."Another one who would rather enjoy staying in a hut killing bucks for food, take away the white people, see how much Zimbabwe means without those white farmers, lol they living the good life now," Lourens Myburgh commented."Most likely an idiot just like his president," Myburg later said.Jessica Nel posted that a 10-year-old had more debating ability than Hutton."My boy of ten years old has more integrity and debating-ability than this artistic person. Sticks and stones (and petrol bombs) may break my bones, but the words of an empty tin cannot hurt me," Nel said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
