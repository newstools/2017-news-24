Lackay had not opposed the media application, though SARS had objected.Lackay, who was employed for 11 years at SARS, has claimed that it he was forced to leave after it had become "untenable" to associate himself with the goings-on at the revenue service.The rogue unit allegations led to former deputy SARS commissioner Ivan Pillay being suspended.Lackay previously appeared at the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria after Moyane and SARS resolved to sue him for defamation. SARS wants R10m in damages from him, and Moyane R2m.Lackay&rsquo;s lawyer advocate Max du Plessis previously said SARS, as an organ of State, could not be defamed. He argued for the matter to be struck off the roll.William Mokhari, for SARS and Moyane, argued that if the reputations of "critical institutions" like SARS were dented, the economy would crumble."The statements that were made are defamatory. Calling the commissioner a liar is also defamatory. Who cares where he gets the money [R12m] from," Mokhari said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
