The LRA is Joseph Kony who is the leader," Ongwen told the court in December.A Catholic, Kony, came from a family which was said to be possessed by spirits, "a potentially frightening thing" for others around him, witness Tim Allen, an anthropology professor at the London School of Economics, told the court, as he gave a sombre account of the militia's bloody history.A self-styled mystic and prophet, Kony launched a rebellion against Kampala some three decades ago seeking to impose his own version of the Ten Commandments on northern Uganda.The UN says it has slaughtered more than 100 000 people and abducted 60 000 children since it was set up in 1987. Allen said many people were fearful of Kony and his "unpredictability" and they were "brutally abducted and forced to see and do terrible things."Kony remains at large, believed to be hiding in the jungles of the Central African Republic, after Ongwen surrendered to US special forces in January 2015.Defence lawyers said he feared for his life and was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
