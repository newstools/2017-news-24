The United Nations puts the figure at 5 000. Tunisia's government said last week that it had jailed or closely monitored 800 jihadists who had returned from foreign battlefields.Concern has been growing for the threat posed by returning jihadists, with the national union for security forces last month urging the government to take "exceptional measures" against them.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
