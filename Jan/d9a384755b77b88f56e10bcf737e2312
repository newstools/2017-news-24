The three were part of Grace's her security personnel.One of Ahmed's employees, Talent Kasiya, deposed an affidavit at the High Court on January 3, claiming that two more houses belonging to his employer had again been seized.&nbsp;"On Sunday December 18 I attended Dungarvan House, Wilson Avenue in Borrowdale, where I saw two men whom I recognised as having been part of the group that had initially come to the Cambridge Road premises. I noticed that the lock at the back entrance of Dungarvan House had in fact been broken and, as there was noone manning the gate, I was able to enter," read part of the affividavit.Second eviction order&nbsp;Ahmed's attorney, Beatrice Mtetwa, confirmed the latest development."When the courts opened on Tuesday, it issued a second eviction order for the two additional houses and we are now waiting for the deputy sheriff to deliver the notices. If the First Lady and any of her representatives refuse to vacate the five premises then they would be in contempt of court," said Mtetwa.However, Grace's lawyer, Wellington Pasipanodya said the First Lady was yet to be served with the notices."My client is out of the country and has not been advised of the notices. She was out of the country when the said properties were allegedly invaded," said Pasipanodya.Sources in the deputy sheriff's offices said the order issued by Justice Phiri could not be served on the First Lady because he was barred by soldiers manning the First Lady's residence in the leafy Borrowadale suburb.&nbsp;"Macauff Madega (the sheriff of the High Court) was barred by soldiers upon his arrival at BlueRoof (Mugabe's residence) who said that the area fell under protected areas and he could not deliver the notice," said one source.The dispute was sparked by the First Lady's refusal to accept a polished diamond ring that she had ordered from Ahmed. The ring was meant to be Mugabe's gift to Grace to mark their 20th wedding anniversary.&nbsp;Court papers showed that Grace paid $1.3m for the ring using her local bank account. When she demanded a refund after deciding that she no longer wanted the ring, the First Lady demanded that Ahmed pays the money into her account held at a Dubai bank. Ahmed, however, refused, saying anti-money laundering laws did not allow him to do so and opted to pay the First Lady in installments through a third party. But Grace refused, resulted in her seizing Ahmed's properties.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
