There are proper people here."Committee chairperson Vincent Smith later also joked that if certain financial facts were incorrect by the completion of the report, they could blame it on one of the Parliament support staff members.READ: Don&rsquo;t drop the ball on SABCFinal testACDP MP Steve Swart, a lawyer by trade, volunteered his services to the unlucky individual.The tone of the meeting was proof of a committee that had grafted through two months of witness testimony, SABC defiance, draft reporting, political differences, and one that has been said to be&nbsp;an example of what parliamentary work&nbsp;can and should&nbsp;be between competing parties.They were also quick to thank the support staff for the long hours they too had put into the compilation of the report.The committee had finalised the first three sections of their report by lunchtime on Thursday, which&nbsp;included an&nbsp;introduction, mission statement, terms of reference, witness testimonies and methodology.After lunch, it would debate the final report, and observations and recommendations going forward, which may be the final test of the committee's general comradery.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
