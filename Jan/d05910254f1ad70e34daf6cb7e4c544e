Officers gave chase and caught him.Metro police spokesperson Wayne Dyason said the man who shot the suspect had been carrying a licensed firearm and happened to be walking past the apparent smash-and-grab incident.The bullet hit the suspect in his right knee and went through his left calf. Police took him to a nearby hospital for medical attention.Call for bail to be deniedAccording to the City, one of the suspects has been linked to a smash-and-grab incident that occurred on Saturday afternoon.Mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith called for the suspects to be denied bail."I hope that they are denied bail, otherwise the good work in this case will be undone.
