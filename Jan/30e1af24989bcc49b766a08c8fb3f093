[Her] service was terminated on 30 June 2014 after the expiry of her contract, and not in April 2016," said Nkambule.Mhaule's spokesperson, Jasper Zwane, refused to comment on the allegations, but confirmed that the department was assisting Mkhabela to make an application to the government employees' pension fund."The department is assisting her to get her pension," he said.'Politicians do not care about the people'SAPS spokespersons Brigadier Leonard Hlathi and Sergeant Gerald Sedibe failed to respond to&nbsp;a media enquiry, however, a source from the Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed that Nelspruit police had interviewed some officials regarding the matter.EFF organiser in Mbombela, Sfiso Gumede, confirmed that a case has been opened at the Nelspruit police station."The investigating officer has confirmed the police are investigating the case of fraud, and the case number is CAS 258/11/2016."Politicians in the province of Mpumalanga have shown that they do not care about the people and the high level of corruption is an indication of that," said Gumede.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
