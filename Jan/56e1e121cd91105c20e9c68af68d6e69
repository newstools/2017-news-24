It must be ready to convince millions of others to vote for the EFF," Shivambu said.&nbsp;"In 2019, there must be change of government. There must be change of those who are currently governing and replaced by a progressive movement that is the EFF."At the conference, which starts on Friday and ends on Sunday, the party will discuss Malema's political report, the election report and how the EFF fared, and the upcoming four elective provincial conferences to be held in KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, Gauteng and the North West.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
