We achieve our mandate by addressing the causes and consequences of the over-population of diseased, stray, neglected, abused or dangerous domestic animals in specific areas via the implementation of a free, consistent, extremely focused and goal driven mass animal sterilisation treatment and education campaign, said Tamsin Nel, founder and managing director.This, along with the provision of an animal ambulance, hospital for the sick and injured, massive kennel building and distribution programme (almost 3000 to date) and other community empowerment initiatives where it is most needed, is their contribution to the compassionate development and well-being of our Rainbow Nation.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
