I'm not a servant of anybody. I am a freedom fighter. That's what I do. I don't do it because I am your servant. I am not your servant."I am just a freedom fighter. I am fighting for myself, for my beliefs," Museveni was heard saying in a video posted to Twitter by NTV Kenya.Watch the video below&nbsp;He continued: "I am not an employee, If anybody thinks he gave me a job, he is deceiving himself. I am just a freedom fighter who you thought could help you also."Museveni won a fifth term in controversial elections last year in February. His remarks, according to Chimp Reports, were seemingly directed at his longtime rival, Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) leader Kizza Besigye, who in his "Defiance Campaign" rallies has been quoted by the media as saying that Ugandans must cease to treat people in leadership positions as masters, but rather as servants.Besigye maintains that citizens are "masters of their leaders".&nbsp;Excuse me, did you say your servant?
