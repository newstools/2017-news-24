According to&nbsp;SABC, Ghali also urged the African Union (AU) to reject the re-admission of Morocco into the continental body."It is quite unfortunate to see that despite the fact that colonialism should be over, one of the African territories still suffers direct occupation by the Kingdom of Morocco. It is about time that Africa and the AU stand firmly in support of Sahrawi and the Sahrawi people. The Sahrawian people have been fighting for independence from Morocco for decades," Ghali was quoted as saying.
