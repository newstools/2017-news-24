Guterres said he was also pressing for a Rwandan tactical helicopter unit to be deployed in the first wave. Kenya has told the United Nations it was open to discussing its participation in the new force even though it withdrew its peacekeepers from South Sudan to protest a UN decision to fire the Kenyan commander of the mission.A delegation from the UN peacekeeping office is due to visit Nairobi to discuss Kenya's role, said the report.After gaining independence from Sudan in 2011, South Sudan descended into war in December 2013, leaving tens of thousands dead and more than 3.1 million people displaced.There is growing alarm over the humanitarian crisis in the country as the conflict entered its fourth year.More than six million people - half of South Sudan's population - are in need of urgent aid and humanitarian organizations expect this number to rise by 20 to 30% next year.In the first weeks of his tenure as secretary-general, Guterres has been engaged in telephone diplomacy with regional leaders to discuss the way forward in South Sudan.A peace deal signed in August 2015 was in tatters after rebel leader Riek Machar fled Juba during the fighting in July.
