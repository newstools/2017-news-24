We want to bring positivity to being a politician," Modieleng said.She said politicians are also human and should be recognised for their work. They could include the nominations in their CVs which would help them in their applications to senior positions in institutions such as the African Union, she said.Modieleng admitted that a number of politicians had already declined, including Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula and Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, although they are still waiting for email confirmation from Sisulu's office.She said Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba, who has been nominated in categories including best dressed, had confirmed his participation as a nominee but would not be able to attend."I was not surprised when the EFF declined because it has confidence in itself, but I am shocked by the ANC as things don't look good for them in 2019 elections," Modieleng said.The awards also have a citizens' choice category, with the likes of former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng, premiers Ace Magashule and Supra Mahumapelo, ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe and Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan nominated. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
