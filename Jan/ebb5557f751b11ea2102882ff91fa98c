from a Department of Home Affairs transport vehicle at the Mooi River Toll
Plaza in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands on Thursday morning. It is not immediately clear how many escaped, however
initial reports put the figure at approximately nine. It is understood that the
prisoners are illegal immigrants in detention. A well-placed source with knowledge of the incident, who
spoke to News24 on condition of anonymity, said that several prisoners had
broken the locks of a police transport vehicle as it slowed down at the
tollgate. "They broke the door open and then scattered into
traffic. As they made their escape, shots were fired but all the commotion
caused a multi-vehicle pile-up," he said. "The prisoners then ran into Bruntville [an informal
settlement that lies adjacent to the toll plaza] and now there is a search for
them. The problem is that the prisoners were dressed in civilian clothing so
they are hard to spot," the source added. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane
confirmed that the incident had taken place. "They were being transferred by Home Affairs officials
from Ladysmith to Pietermaritzburg. The scene is still active and we are
gathering information," he said. Zwane said that to his knowledge, there had not been a
shooting or an accident at the toll plaza as a result of the daring escape. This is a developing story. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
