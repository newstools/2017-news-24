This might have led to the friction in this incident, he said.The officers driving the vehicle said they did not give the complainant a chance to join the flow of traffic, while the officers had the right of way. The individual then started following them, Smith said."The officer who was driving observed this dangerous behaviour [of the complainant following them] and moved off to the side of the road and indicated to the complainant, by putting his hand out of the window, to pass," Smith said."It is perhaps this that made him think they had tossed something out of the window."The officers had indicated that they would be seeking legal advice on their rights, "given the damage to their reputations and to that of the city", Smith said.Coetzee could not be reached for comment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
