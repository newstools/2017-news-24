They wanted fishing restricted to a limited number of months per fishing area.Government should provide compensation, based on average market prices, to all West Coast rock lobster fishing rights holders when the season was closed.The organisations said that while the costs of paying compensation might seem significant, a multi-million rand restitution order would help cover this.In 2012, US courts awarded the South African government restitution of about R750m. This was after former Hout Bay fishing magnate Arnold Bengis was jailed in the US in 2004 for smuggling South African lobster and Patagonian toothfish into the US. In 2007, South Africa applied for Bengis and his co-accused to pay restitution.&nbsp;The mismanagement of the industry meant communities who relied on it would suffer more if stocks were depleted, Masifundise Development Trust director Naseegh Jaffer said.The department was unable to provide News24 with comment at the time of publication. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
