To date they have failed to do so and remain in contempt of court," the statement said.The SJC said that the police were intentionally delaying court proceedings."This discrimination continues to put not only the lives of those living in poor working-class neighbourhoods at risk, but also the lives of the police men and women deployed to protect them," it said.Among the claims the SJC makes in the court case is that for every 100 000 people in Harare, Khayelitsha, there are three times more murders (over four years), but 14 times less police personnel than in Cape Town Central.Additionally, SJC said over four years Nyanga had 16 times more murders per 100 000, but seven times less police personnel than Camps Bay.The court case was launched by the SJC, Equal Education (EE) and the Nyanga Community Police Forum (CPF) and is made in terms of the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act 4 of 2000.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
