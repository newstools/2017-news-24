"They basically were paid to make a few phone calls," said Jankielsohn, a member of the Free State legislature. &nbsp;Some agents apparently claimed up to 30% from the money meant for fodder. &nbsp;'Fodder exchanged for cattle'The DA said the department of agriculture could have done the work itself, but instead agents were appointed to milk the system. The agents had previously received a 10% commission.Jankielsohn also accused the department of giving drought aid to people who didn't qualify for it."The DA has proof of one such case in which a person who'd received fodder tried to sell it to commercial farmers or exchange it for cattle. This has already been brought to the Public Protector's attention." &nbsp;He said it was an indictment on the Free State government that much-needed drought aid, which was supposed to help farmers who had been hardest hit, was being abused to enrich a few. It couldn't have been done without the co-operation of officials who had to determine which farmers needed the help most, he said.Agriculture spokesperson Zimasa Mbewu said the department would respond to the claims in full on Thursday.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
