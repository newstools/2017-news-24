Metro residents are advised that hot weather conditions are expected to persist requiring renewed efforts to use water sparingly. Nelson Mandela Bay residents are advised that hot weather conditions are expected to persist and require renewed efforts to use water sparingly as areas supplied by the Nooitgedagt Water Treatment Works (WTW) are currently experiencing low water pressure and shortages, said municipal spokesperson Kupido Baron.He said the raw water input from the Scheepersvlakte Dam was not enough for the Nooitgedagt WTW to cope with the high water demand from its supply zone resulting in Motherwell, Ibhayi, Chatty, Despatch and Uitenhage experiencing water supply difficulties. Residents and business in these areas could therefore experience low water pressure or water shortages as a result, warned Baron.Reservoir Hills in Despatch is the only suburb of the Metro affected by a lack of water supply owing to its location and the high water consumption by residents from surrounding lower lying suburbs which prevent sufficient pressure to build up to restore supply to the area.According to Baron, the municipality has put plans in place to improve the situation, but improvement is dependent on the drastic reduction on current water consumption levels.Therefore the municipality is appealing to all residents, businesses and visitors to heed the call and use water sparingly as per water restriction notices. Baron urged residents to use water sparingly and remember to report all water leaks and abuse to 0800 20 50 50 or email waterrestrictions@mandelametro.gov.za.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
