Political tensions rose as President Joseph Kabila neared the end of his second and final term in office in December after 16 years in power, but showed no sign of leaving.Scores of people have been killed in clashes before and since the deadline, with the Church leading efforts to reach a deal between the government and opposition on a way out of the crisis.A new political deal foresees the appointment of a new prime minister and a transitional body to pave the way to elections in December 2017 that could finally bring an end to Kabila's rule.The United State had been calling for Sawyer to be allowed to return to the DRC."The forced departure of this researcher... is incompatible with efforts to support greater transparency, accountability and democracy in the DRC," a US State Department spokesperson said in August.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
