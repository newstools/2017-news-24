"The first vehicle was hit on the tire and the driver could not proceed so the passengers alighted and fled into the bush. The second vehicle was a pickup van carrying many passengers, and many of them could not escape."The gun fight continued for some time with many passengers ducking in their vehicles to avoid being hit by bullets, said Pambe.The incident came three days after Boko Haram gunmen suffered a heavy loss of members after a foiled attempt to attack a military base in Borno state.In that incident, a large number of the insurgents stormed a military base in Kamaya but failed to dislodge the soldiers.Neither the police nor the military has yet issued a statement on the Maiduguri-Biu road attack.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
