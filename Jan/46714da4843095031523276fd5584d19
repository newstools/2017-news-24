Applicants also need to detail plans of what provisions would be taken to detain and sober up those who are too drunk to drive, and who try to leave the venue.Furthermore, fire and evacuation plans have to be submitted.However, Pandelani said applications submitted so far had amounted to little more than "hot air", with some simply submitting a letter, with no proof of conforming to the requirements.He said each application submitted was examined on a case-by-case basis. However, because the applicants had all failed to meet the criteria, the board was refusing to grant extensions, as an act of "fighting lawlessness".CriticismThe move to extend hours has been met criticism. The ANC Women's League said the anniversary, which was held to reflect on the successes and challenges that faced the ANC the previous year and chart a way forward for the new year, could not be seen as a "drinking spree"."This tradition was started in 1972 and the ANCWL, as an integral part of the ANC, will not allow this historic event to be viewed as a drinking spree which requires liquor trading hours to be relaxed by liquor boards," the league said in a statement on Wednesday.However, Gauteng Economic Development MEC Lebogang Mail previously said in a statement that he was satisfied with the temporary relaxing of liquor trading hours.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
