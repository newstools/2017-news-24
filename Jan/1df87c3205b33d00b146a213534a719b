These are the books we are now distributing with stationery.&rdquo;The contract of one of the department&rsquo;s service providers had expired and finding a replacement was taking time because they had to follow procedures, he said.He said he was not aware of any schools closing because of a textbook shortage.&ldquo;There is no school that can be completely dysfunctional because they do have textbooks. They are waiting for the top-ups. We are not saying we are happy about that. That is why we are apologising to the schooling community.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
