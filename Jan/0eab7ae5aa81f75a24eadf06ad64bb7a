However, he said the league would push for a generational mix in the top leadership, including the top six positions.The ANCYL wants 40% of the NEC to be made up of young people."As young people our primary focus is to ensure that ANC is getting younger and therefore [when] we discuss leadership that will be taken into cognizance," Maine said.The league said it was under no pressure to pronounce its preferred candidate ahead of the December elective conference. It will announce its candidate after the ANC policy conference in June, Maine said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
