She then kicked and hit a female traffic official.&nbsp;"The woman was also charged with assault," said Smith."Her behaviour was shocking, but not uncommon. Our officials are often targeted by people who do not respect anyone or anything. We are not going to change people's behaviour if they are not sent to prison for a long time or we name and shame them," he said. &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
