As I said, the government is doing what it said it would do and the central bank is doing what it said it would do," he said.In addition to floating the pound, authorities also increased tariffs on hundreds of imported items to up to 60% in December and introduced a value-added tax in September.The IMF approved the first $2.75bn tranche in November after Egypt saw its foreign currency reserves plunge amid political turmoil since the 2011 uprising.The tourism sector, one of the main sources of foreign currency, has been badly hit by a persistent jihadist insurgency.President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who led the 2013 military overthrow of Mohamed Morsi, Egypt's first elected civilian president, vowed to get the economy back on track after his election the following year.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
