He said he had been an activist from the age of 9 because he was passionate about service.&ldquo;Some of us, who are activists, are not here because we want to be appointed to the board because we want salaries. Some of us have always served, even without reward, and there is nothing better that fulfils you than being able to effect change in the life of an ordinary South African,&rdquo; he told MPs.The National Youth Development Agency must work with the public and private sectors and civil society to ensure young people participated in society, Morolong said.READ: No politics allowed at NYDA board interviewsSalariesThirteen candidates are vying for the seven seats on the NYDA&rsquo;s board.
