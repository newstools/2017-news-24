They, however, insisted it must be combined with the policy conference.The NEC decided to set aside the first two days of the policy conference, to be held in Gauteng in June, to do so.A task team of ANC officials and stalwarts had been established to focus on the content, structure, and representation of the conference.Mantashe explained that, for matters raised at the consultative conference to be discussed at the ANC&rsquo;s 54th elective conference in December, they first had to be thrashed out at the policy conference."If it doesn&rsquo;t go through the policy conference, it will not see the sun in the national conference. We are finding each other," Mantashe said.READ: ANC succession battle: Stop raising names, says Duarte'Current leadership must step down'One of the stalwarts, who spoke to News24 on condition of anonymity, said the veterans, though hopeful, were waging a difficult battle, which they were unlikely to win."The outcome we are looking for is that this current leadership must step down and an interim structure must see the ANC through the policy conference and an elective conference," the insider said.The stalwart said they believed that ANC leaders did not want a gap between the two conferences because they wanted the current leadership to continue at the helm of the party.Mantashe said organisational renewal was an ongoing issue."The process of consultation that goes on now, must go on after the policy conference and after the conference in December," Mantashe said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
