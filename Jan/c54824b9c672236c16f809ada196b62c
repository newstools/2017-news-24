All they know is that they were panicking, scared and desperate and they wrestled with the snake for a good five minutes," said Van Deventer.Thanks to their awesome power and courage &ndash; or perhaps because of their hysterical screaming and yanking &ndash; a joking Van Deventer said, the snake eventually let go of Jess.The women picked Jess up and phoned Van Deventer.Snake relocated"I had to get hold of a vet at the nearest town on a Sunday morning to open his practice so that we could rush Jess there."&nbsp;Her wound had to be cleaned and stitched up under anaesthetic.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Riaan van der Merwe, a snake handler at the Rhino Orphanage, went to look for the culprit.And the snake hadn't gone far."The snake, probably also a tad sore after the women's yanking, was relocated far away."&nbsp;"Jamie, Kari and the impressive python were slightly traumatised but unharmed. Jess' body is still stiff and sore, but she's home and lapping up all the attention," a clearly relieved Van Deventer said with a smile.&nbsp;* The location of the Rhino Orphanage hasn't been given because of safety concerns. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
