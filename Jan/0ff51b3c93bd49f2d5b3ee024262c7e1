African heads of state failed to elect a new head of the commission last year&nbsp;during its 27th summit in Kigali, Rwanda.None of the three candidates at the time was able to muster the two thirds majority to win the secret box.News24 takes a look at some of Dlamini-Zuma&rsquo;s achievements during her tenure. Three things that went right:1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the African Union's 50th anniversary in 2013, Dlamini-Zuma spearheaded the launch of Agenda 2063 &ndash; a long-term vision of where Africa wants to be in another 50 years. While the success would depend on the implementation by member states, she did manage to get political buy-in for the plan and popularise it.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She managed to crack the glass ceiling in Africa as the first woman to lead the continental organisation. Many have argued that the continent isn&rsquo;t ready for a woman in that position, but two women (out of five candidates) are running for AU Commission chairperson this year, and at least one is a very strong favourite to follow in Dlamini-Zuma&rsquo;s steps. She made women&rsquo;s rights the theme of two consecutive AU summits and the continental body started a major campaign to end child marriage which, together with similar campaigns by other organisations, seems to be bearing some fruit.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her tenure at AU helped turn the attention of South Africans to continental issues after former president Thabo Mbeki&rsquo;s African Renaissance had come to an end. At home Dlamini-Zuma was invited to a number of talks during which she spoke on African issues and preached free movement and tolerance from South Africans towards our neighbours. A lot of this is related to her campaign for the presidency, but at least it made South Africans look beyond the borders again.&nbsp;And a few things that didn't: 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the main criticisms against Dlamini-Zuma is that she was never really present at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa. She spent a lot of time travelling back and forth to South Africa on ANC business, something that caused resentment amongst staff and AU partners &ndash; and affected her work negatively.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dlamini-Zuma&rsquo;s campaign to get elected in 2012 was highly polarising and she never really managed to fully unite the continental body after that. A lack of unity of purpose would have made her work in Addis a lot more difficult.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
