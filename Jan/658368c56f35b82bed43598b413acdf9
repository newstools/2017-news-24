We believe that these financial concessions will enable the majority of students at Wits to register for the 2017 academic year."Students who require funding for 2017 can apply via The Donation Discretionary Fund on the Student Self-Service portal."A new model for the financing of the higher education system is a national priority and we are hopeful that long-term solutions for the financing of the higher education system will be announced during the course of the year," said Patel.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
