He said people would not put their lives in danger for nothing, but Africa should also deal with the issues that force people to flee."Let's deal with the root causes of this and also step up to our responsibility as human beings," he said.Outgoing AU Commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma on Monday said Africa faced "turbulent times" in the light of the refugee ban.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
