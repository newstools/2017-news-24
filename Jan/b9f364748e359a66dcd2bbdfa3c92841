The crime scene was tampered with," Phahlane said during his visit to the family of the slain officer Tshepo Tladi."Once there was a shot, a person moved away. He was carrying a rifle to his left, you literally see that rifle being moved around and then people going out [and] coming back - picking something up."The way the scene was dealt with, it makes it difficult as to what happened... Irrespective of who was responsible for the death of Tshepo, [they] would be dealt with accordingly."The video revealed that a fellow officer may be responsible for Tladi's death.Asked why the police initially said Tladi was shot by robbers, Phahlane said they couldn't have excluded the robbers.READ: Katlehong cop appears to be shot in head by colleagueVideo's circulation 'insensitive'He said he became aware of the video only on Saturday and would also conduct an internal investigation.Phahlane said although the video would help with the investigation, the person who circulated it was insensitive.The media was not allowed to speak to the Tladi family.
