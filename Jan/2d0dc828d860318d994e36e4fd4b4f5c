The ring&rsquo;s owner had apparently just left when Toni Curnick, 46, an amateur treasure hunter, arrived on the beach with his waterproof metal detector. He was spending his holiday in the Western Cape."I searched for almost three hours in the cold sea water, which was up to my hips, before finding it at about 20:00," said Curnick.&nbsp;A woman, who also did metal detection, earlier told him about the woman who had lost her wedding ring in the sea."Apparently, she&rsquo;d searched for the ring for hours, but she gave up shortly before I arrived," said Curnick.&nbsp;"Fortunately my metal detector works in salt water, so I could find the ring in the sea."&nbsp;'Sentimental value'He estimated that the diamond in the ring was about a quarter carat.&nbsp;"The ring itself isn&rsquo;t worth that much, but it possibly has sentimental value."Treasure hunts often amounted to nothing and his finds were mostly rubbish, he said.&nbsp;"Mostly hair clips and beer bottle caps, although one sometimes makes exciting finds, like old coins and valuable jewellery."&nbsp;Curnick said he had found a platinum wedding ring during the holidays as well, which he had returned to the owner.&nbsp;He said he would hold on to the wedding band until the owner claimed it. The owner could contact him on Facebook, but would have to identify the beach where she lost it and describe the ring in detail, he said.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
