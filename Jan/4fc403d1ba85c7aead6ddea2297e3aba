Soro is a contender for the post of parliament speaker - a job he currently holds.The new speaker is due to be elected later on Monday.An analyst said that the army mutiny, which saw soldiers seize the second city of Bouake and several other key areas while demanding bonuses, better pay and houses, could have been masterminded by Ouattara."One of the things to ascertain is whether there has been a political manipulation. We are waiting for the nomination of the vice president and the prime minister... are the former rebel leaders behind this?" one said."At present everybody is thinking about Guillaume Soro," the expert said, referring to one of the leaders of the 2002 rebellion which sliced the former French colony into the rebel-held north and the government-controlled south and triggered years of unrest.Soro had served as prime minister for five years until March 2012. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
