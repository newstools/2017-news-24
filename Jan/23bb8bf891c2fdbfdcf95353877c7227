"He leaves with all his properties so he is not coming up and down to check," Sallah said.Another Barrow spokesperson had alluded angrily to the luxury cars on Sunday, but did not say that the new president had agreed that Jammeh could leave with them.As of Tuesday, the source added, "10 cars" were still earmarked for future shipment, which diplomats and others familiar with the matter confirmed included a Bentley, Land Rovers, a red Mini Cooper, and another Mercedes."No information or orders have been given by this new government to stop shipping the cars," the airport source told AFP.He described Jammeh's entourage as struggling between the choice of two larger Bentleys or three smaller cars, eventually opting for the Mercedes and the Rolls Royces on the night he left the country."They were trying to check which one fits. If they took the bigger cars they could only take two," he said.The news is likely to anger Gambians who have also learnt Jammeh took off with $11 million of state funds, leaving the coffers nearly empty.An "entry-level" Rolls Royce costs $250 000, and most Gambians live on less than $2 a day. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
