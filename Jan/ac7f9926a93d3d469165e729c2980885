The contribution of refugees and migrants to their new homes worldwide has been overwhelmingly positive."The IOM and the UNHCR "hope that the US will continue its strong leadership role and long tradition of protecting those who are fleeing conflict and persecution", the statement said."We strongly believe that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race."Trump's decree suspends the entire US refugee resettlement program for at least 120 days while tough new vetting rules are established to confirm asylum seekers do not pose a security threat.In addition, it specifically bars Syrian refugees from the United States indefinitely, or until the president himself decides that they no longer pose a threat.And it slaps 90-day bans on the issuance of visas for migrants and visitors from seven mainly-Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
