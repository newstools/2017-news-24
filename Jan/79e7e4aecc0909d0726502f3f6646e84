Amid a surge in tensions and some attacks on the convoys blamed on the opposition Renamo, drivers were informally urged to try to avoid travelling next to buses in these convoys, since they could be singled out for attack.But the convoys have been "deactivated" in the last few days, Lusa reports citing police spokesperson Inacio Dina.&nbsp;Renamo considered that keeping the convoys would amount to "a provocation", said the report.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
