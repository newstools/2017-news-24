He responded that the report was still being investigated, not being aware that the report had been finalised and had been handed to Moyane.Lackay said because of the lack of information he made a statement to the media that was not true.Email not taken kindly"It indicated to me that information was being kept away from me. I didn't know why and that was a cause for anxiety in my own mind regarding my position. I had issued an incorrect statement. It is apparent the journalists knew more about the Sikhakhane panel and its findings than I did as a spokesman," Lackay said.Lackay said he decided to write an email to Moyane indicating that the leaks in the paper seemed to be emanating internally from SARS employees, that it was putting the institution at risk and there should be a probe into this.A special exco meeting was called which Lackay was invited to attend. He said that Moyane announced that he would be cancelling the exco because of the news headlines.Lackay said Moyane also said he "does not take kindly to receiving emails from colleagues who accuse SARS of leaking information to the media and requesting investigations".Lackay believed this was a reference to his email.His testimony will continue tomorrow.&nbsp; &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
