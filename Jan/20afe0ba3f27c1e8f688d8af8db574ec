We found out that my boy had been positively identified by another family."We had to come the following day so that we could make sure that we clear the matter. The other family insisted that my son's remains were theirs and a lot of arguing took place in the mortuary."Eventually the two families were forced to take the bodies out of the body bags."We had to search for marks on his body that he was born with. They called the mother of the other unidentified boy, and the mother managed to identify his son using his hands and feet&hellip;"Khumalo said he was traumatised."When I found him, there was a big open wound on his face, another next to his eye and the bones on his wrists and elbows were out.
