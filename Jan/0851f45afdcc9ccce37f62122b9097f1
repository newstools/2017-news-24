Banjul - Gambian leader Yahya Jammeh flew out on Saturday from the country he ruled for 22 years to cede power to President Adama Barrow and end a political crisis.Jammeh refused to step down after a December 1 election in which Barrow was declared the winner, triggering weeks of uncertainty that almost ended in a military intervention involving five other west African nations.The longtime leader, wearing his habitual white flowing robes, waved to supporters before boarding a small, unmarked plane at Banjul airport alongside Guinea's President Alpha Conde after two days of talks over a departure deal.See some of the pictures below&nbsp;Yahya walks towards the plane as he leaves the country in Banjul airport.&nbsp;Jammeh waves from the plane as he leaves the country in Banjul.
