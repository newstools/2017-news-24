All I can say is that some soldiers are missing in action."Buni Yadi, some 65km from the Yobe state capital, Damaturu, fell into the hands of Boko Haram in February 2014 after Boko Haram attacked a boys' boarding school.At least 43 students were killed as they slept and the school was set ablaze. The militants sacked the town and remained in control until March last year until they were ousted by the Nigerian military.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
