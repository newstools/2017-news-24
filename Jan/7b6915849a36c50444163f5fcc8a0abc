Malamule said water tankers were being dispatched to the hospital, but it was not enough, as demand was too high.Part of the reason was that a pipe had become blocked following heavy rain.Malamulele said there was nothing much the department could do and that the hospital would have to admit fewer patients until the problem was resolved.The department was in talks to have a new pipeline installed, but this might take five years.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
