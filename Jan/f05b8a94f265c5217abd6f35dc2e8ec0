He gets out of his bed to deal with issues. Show me another [CPF member] that does that," he said to murmurs of agreement from the volunteers."Usually when you outshine others, then they have a problem with you. Hanif is a class of his own. They want to pull him down because he is making [the rest of them] look like a bunch of plonkers."Bangladeshi businessman Mustapha Goolam, who was kidnapped in December for a ransom of R10m and was found two days later in Khayelitsha, attended the meeting in support of Loonat."When Mustapha was kidnapped, we went to SAPS and they did nothing," another Bangladeshi said."Mr Loonat stood with us. That's why we are here."Phone tapping threatsThe decision for Loonat to step down evolved over "many months and after tough deliberation and thoughtful consultation", the letter signed by eight CPF chairpersons said."It is recognised that you have developed a highly manipulative public personality using print, broadcast and social media. It is unfortunate that media outlets and the people who follow you do not know how incredibly opportunistic and destructive you are behind the scenes."The letter further states that Loonat caused harm to partnerships and intimidated members who disagreed with him."You continue to express views in public forums that represent your own opinions and not those of the collective whose mandate you seem to ignore. Your personal political ambitions have also impacted negatively on us, where we are clearly required to remain non-aligned and apolitical..."Loonat has previously stood as a ward candidate for the ANC in Lansdowne, but has expressed his dissatisfaction with the ruling party in recent months.Among the accusations being made by the letter's signatories is that Loonat has threatened to tap the phones of CPF board members to "expose unsubstantiated claims and allegations to silence members from speaking out", causing divisions within the structure and "paranoid behaviour" which sees anyone who disagrees with him ostensibly being viewed as an enemy.He was also, in the letter, challenged for making statements to the media without the proper CPF mandate and for undermining the provincial CPF board after failing to be elected chairperson. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
