"That is how I was brought up."At the school&rsquo;s inter-house athletics meeting on Friday, one of the starters called Van Straten because there was a "problem".&nbsp;When he got there, he saw five-year-old Angela Motswamere waiting &ndash; and raring to go.&nbsp;"The starter said there was a physically disabled [child] who wanted to run and that someone would have to help her."He initially thought she was paralysed."When I first saw her, I thought she was sitting on her knees. It was only when she got up, that I realised that she didn&rsquo;t have lower legs."Without thinking twice, Van Straten picked her up and put her on his back.&nbsp;"Angela giggled all the way."Van Straten said it was a bit of a challenge running with her on his back.&nbsp;"At the start, I thought it would be unfair to run away from the other children. But it was heavy going with Angela on my back. I had to try hard not to finish last."But it isn&rsquo;t where we finished the race which mattered. I couldn&rsquo;t see Angela&rsquo;s face while we were running, but when I put her down, she laughed all the time and was all smiles. That was the most precious. She and I had both enjoyed it."The teachers had told him that if he hadn&rsquo;t given Angela a piggyback ride, the determined little girl would&rsquo;ve tackled the race on her stumps."I love sport and children. That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t hesitate to do it."The principal, Eddie Conradie, said messages had been streaming in since photos were posted on Facebook.&nbsp;"People just wanted to say what a nice gesture it had been," he said.&nbsp;Van Straten and his wife Joanie have their own challenges at home.Their two-year-old daughter Carli was born with four different heart defects and has already undergone three open heart surgeries. &nbsp;&nbsp;"We are rearing her the same as any of the other children. That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t hesitate to help Angela."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
