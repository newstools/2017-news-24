He told News24 the only way forward was to have a united ANC."The 2017 conference will be very critical. It's a turning point for the ANC. Once we commit mistakes there, then the ANC is finished."He said the gender of the next ANC leader was unimportant. Instead, the new head would need to lead the people of South Africa.Mathabatha said he hoped the party would use the policy conference in June to create parameters around the type of leadership it wanted going towards the 2019 elections."Once we can agree, we will produce a leadership that can unite the party," he said.Limpopo is deeply divided over who to back, as the provincial executive conference is split.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
