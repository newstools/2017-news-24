Teboho.SetenaThe minister of Higher Education and Training Blade Nzimande, has called on organisations representing students at Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges to engage in discussion with the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) and college administrations. His appeal last Wednesday (18/01) came after some college principals informed him that student organisations at their institutions intend to protest over a range of grievances once the term starts.Apparently student organisations are disgusted by, amongst others, colleges delay in releasing exam results in time and issuing certificates of qualifications after graduating, as well as failing to use correct procedures when processing students detail. Nzimande said considerable progress has been made since the department took over 50 colleges two years ago. He pointed out that in some places the department was still in the process of ensuring that the right procedures are used when processing students detail.Nzimande has also appealed for tolerance and respect of the constitutional rights of others.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
