The penalties being suspended by the policy change could be re-imposed if Sudan backtracks on the progress it has made, they added.In any case, decisions on continuing the diplomatic outreach will be up to the incoming Trump administration, which takes office on January 20. Any changes are likely to enrage segments of the human rights community, who've long blasted Khartoum's Arab-led government for its conduct in Darfur and treatment of various ethnic groups.Years of limited US engagementBeyond recognising Sudan's improvements, the officials said the new approach signals an admission that years of limited US engagement with Khartoum had not produced the desired result. Such an acknowledgement fits with a general pattern under Obama of rapprochement with rogue or antagonistic states, including Cuba, Iran and Myanmar.The administration hinted at a policy shift last fall.In September, the State Department issued an out-of-the-blue statement welcoming Khartoum's co-operation in fighting Islamic extremist groups, without mentioning any specific development or reason for the public release.It said Sudan had taken "important steps" to take on the Islamic State group and other such organisations, adding that the US would work with the country on security matters while pressing it on human rights and democracy.At the time, the department said the US maintained grave concerns about Sudan's policies, notably its handling of unrest in the western Darfur region, but described normalised relations as not out of the question.Limited travel&nbsp;The department first labelled Sudan a terrorism sponsor in 1993. Among those Sudan harbored was Osama bin Laden, prompting President Bill Clinton to launch airstrikes in 1998. Sudan is one of only three countries still identified as such after Cuba was removed from the list in 2015. Syria and Iran are the others, although the Obama administration sealed a landmark nuclear deal with Tehran a year and a half ago.Sudan's changes have largely occurred below the radar. But the US credits the country with limiting travel of Islamic State militants and shifting toward greater alignment with Saudi Arabia, and less with Iran. Israel also has pressed the US to adopt a friendlier relationship with Sudan after it cracked down on shipments of suspected Iranian weapons to groups hostile to the Jewish state.The announcement will surely draw criticism from human rights groups because of ongoing allegations of rights abuses, notably in Darfur, and Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir's indictment by the International Criminal Court for related atrocities. Al-Bashir is wanted for crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide charges.Darfur has been gripped by bloodshed since 2003, when rebels took up arms against the government, accusing it of discrimination and neglect. The United Nations says 300 000 people have died in the conflict and 2.7 million have fled their homes.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
