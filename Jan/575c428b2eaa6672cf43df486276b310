He denied this and said the circulation of lists was malicious. It went against the spirit of both the NEC and the party's provincial executive committee.The list apparently surfaced after the ANC Women&rsquo;s League announced it would back outgoing African Union chair Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to replace her Zuma. The ANCWL put forward other names it wanted to see in the ruling party&rsquo;s top six.&ldquo;More than ever before, all of us are called upon to approach the 54th National Conference in a manner that enhances unity in order to enable the ANC to recover lost ground and win back the public confidence,&rdquo; read the statement.Makhura said slates, factionalism, and corruption had no place in the 105-year-old liberation movement.He asked for the &ldquo;faceless distributors&rdquo; of such lists to stop using his name and those of other leaders to cause division in the party.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
