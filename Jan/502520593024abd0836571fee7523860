There is [water] tankering that is taking place, and the dam is empty," Johnson told News24 after the meeting."As a result of all of that, it became very clear that we needed to go back and the department promised that Magalies would be the implementing agent to drive that programme and clean the dam."Funding problemsJohnson said the department was instructed to send a letter to the Magalies Water Board in November 2016 telling it to immediately see to the issues in the area.After initially failing to send the letter in November, the department promised last week that it would send the instructions by Monday, January 23, Johnson said.As of Wednesday, the committee has still not received confirmation that the letter was sent.The department previously claimed there were no funds available for the project, said Johnson. If that was the problem they should have communicated that to Parliament sooner, he said.The committee will give Mokonyane until Friday to provide an explanation and send instructions to the water board to finish the work.If&nbsp;she fails to do so the committee will summons the department to appear before it.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
