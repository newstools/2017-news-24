More recently, they have blamed the states for "bad faith" for allowing "criminals to circulate freely" instead of extraditing them to stand trial in DRC."We sympathise with DRC on issues of belligerents but they should not use M23 rebels in Uganda (when they) should be concentrating on their country", Uganda's Foreign Minister Henry Okello Oryem told AFP Sunday. "Let them concentrate on issues of governance in their country," he added.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
