But on December 3, the country found itself with two presidents: the constitutional council declared Gbagbo the victor, while the electoral commission said that Ouattara won. The UN recognised Ouattara's victory and the European Union, France and the United States called on Gbagbo to stand down.On December 7, West African regional bloc Ecowas said it recognised Ouattara as president and suspended the Ivory Coast's membership.Two days later the African Union also decided to suspend the Ivory Coast.A deadly four-month post-election crisis followed Gbagbo's refusal to hand over power, in which more than 3000 people were killed.On April 11, Gbagbo was arrested by Ouattara's troops after 10 days of fighting in Abidjan, backed by French and UN soldiers.On May 21, 2011, Ouattara was sworn in as president.Gbagbo is currently on trial before the International Criminal Court (ICC) for crimes against humanity in relation to the clashes.Madagascar&nbsp;The island nation was paralysed by protests during a political crisis in 2001-2002.In January 2002, President Didier Ratsiraka's rival, Antananarivo mayor and successful entrepreneur Marc Ravalomanana, sent his supporters into the streets claiming victory in the first round of presidential elections held in December 2001.Ravalomanana refused to organise a second round of voting, while Ratsiraka declined to concede defeat, plunging the country into seven months of violence and chaos.The impasse split the vast nation in two - with two capitals, two governments, and a divided army - until Ravalomanana was officially proclaimed president in April 2002 and sworn in on May 6, with Ratsiraka still disputing the result.In July Ravalomanana conquered the whole of the territory and Ratsiraka started a 11-year exile in France.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
