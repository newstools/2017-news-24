Users took to Twitter under the hashtag #GraceBibleChurch after local celebrity Somizi Mhlongo posted a video online that he stormed out of the church following Heward-Mills comments. Discussing the soul and sins, Heward-Mills compared homosexuality to nature saying it was unnatural. He said: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nature. Dogs, cats, leopards. Which animal has one partner? It&rsquo;s just like homosexuality, you don&rsquo;t have male and male. You don&rsquo;t find two male dogs, two male lions, two male impala&rsquo;s, two male lizards. You don&rsquo;t find that in nature. That is unnatural. There is nothing like that in nature.&rdquo; According to Mhlongo, he stormed out after the comments saying he would not &ldquo;sit there and listen to someone offending me&rdquo;. &ldquo;This is who I am. I am a gay man. Get it straight into your skull.&nbsp; My soul is alright with my God. Let me deal with my God and my soul. Don&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo; Mhlongo went on to criticise other gay congregants of the church who did not object to the comments. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like somebody offending black people at church and you scream and shout. And I&rsquo;m actually disappointed at all the gay men and women that sat there and listened to him offending us and didn&rsquo;t do anything about it.&rdquo; He continued:&nbsp; &ldquo;I walked out and visibly so. I am proud and I&rsquo;m going to remain gay for the rest of my life. Let God deal with me.&rdquo; Twitter followers reacted with mixed emotionsTweets: Just because @somizi is offended doesn't mean truth must stop being told! #GraceBibleChurch That's why I'm Pro God and Anti Bible. It causes so much Anger &amp; Hatred, I believe God loves his Children unconditionally #GraceBibleChurch Church is a place where truths are spoken, even though it makes a lot of us uncomfortable#Gracebiblechurch#GraceBibleChurch In the bible God talks about gay people and he also talks about judging people.Controversy 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
