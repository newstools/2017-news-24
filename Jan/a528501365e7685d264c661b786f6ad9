There is no way they will allow another episode of xenophobic attacks. I'm quite assured," Mguni told the paper.Xenophobic attacks mainly in Kwa-Zulu Natal between March and May 2015 left seven foreigners dead and displaced around 5 000. There is a sizeable number of Zimbabweans living in South Africa, both illegally and legally, though the exact figure is not known. Fact-checkers @AfricaCheck have previously said that estimates of between one and three million Zimbabweans based across the Limpopo cannot be substantiated.There are fears that Zimbabwe's latest economic crisis - which has seen the authorities regularly failing to pay civil servants on time - may lead to a surge in the number of locals heading south.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
