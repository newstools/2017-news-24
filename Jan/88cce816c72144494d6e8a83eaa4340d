He was meeting leaders on both sides.&ldquo;He is here to listen and learn about the conflict and the potential leadership role that South Africa could and should be playing in constructively assisting both parties to resume negotiations,&rdquo; the party said in a statement.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
