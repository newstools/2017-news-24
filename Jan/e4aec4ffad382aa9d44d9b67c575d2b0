It said the trial, which started in 2015, can continue on all 18 charges.The judges wrote that rape and sexual slavery are "prohibited at all times, both in times of peace and during armed conflicts, and against all persons, irrespective of any legal status".Ntaganda denies all the charges.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
