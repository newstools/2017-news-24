It became bogged down in the middle of the torrent.Both the driver and the girl ventured into the water and a search and rescue official managed to save the taxi driver but was swept away while trying to rescue the teen.Mahlangu said the rain was crucial in breaking the longest and most devastating drought ever experienced in South Africa in more than 100 years.&nbsp; &nbsp; "The rains are important, especially in ensuring food security for the poor, but with it come the dangers of flooding, especially in rural areas," he said."[The] lack of adequate infrastructure, which includes water drainage systems in rural villages [and a] lack of proper roads and bridges, poses a threat to rural road users. &nbsp; "A lack of sufficient knowledge on how to mitigate flood disaster in South Africa, especially among the disadvantaged communities, could spell a huge disaster to road users, learners crossing rivulets and kids swimming in water ponds and flowing rivers, owing to lack of knowledge of flooding and its&nbsp; dangers," Mahlangu said.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
