Intubation for such tiny babies is delicate enough, but as their faces are so close to one another and they are not able to be placed on their backs to be intubated for anaesthesia, this was a great deal more complicated than usual."Four anaesthetists, wearing colour-coded scrub caps, took care of the twins during the surgery.Getting the anaesthetic "just right" for the surgery, took more than three hours, almost half of the total theatre time.The twins were officially separated at midday and the surgery was completed shortly before 14:00. The twins' parents, Bongkile and Mbongeni, found out they were expecting a second set of twins when Bongkile was seven-months pregnant.Their first set, both boys, are two."At first I was not happy to hear that I was expecting twins for the second time," she said. "However, once they were born everything changed. After their birth I was at first not worried as I thought the babies were only attached at the umbilical cord."The hospital&rsquo;s general manager Robert Jordaan said they were impressed by the ease with which Bongkile handled her conjoined babies, "considering the difficulty in doing something as basic as picking them up".Eight doctors and a theatre team of 11 nursing professionals took part in the procedure.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
