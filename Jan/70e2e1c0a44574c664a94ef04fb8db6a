High tensionsBarrow is in Senegal, where he plans to remain until the inauguration on Thursday. On Monday his special adviser Mai Fatty read a statement on his behalf in Dakar, urging Gambians to "exercise restraint, observe the rule of law and not to respond to provocation".A personal tragedy struck Barrow on Sunday when his eight-year-old son Habibou died after being bitten by dogs, according to a family source.With tensions running high, Jammeh said on Sunday that he had spoken to Liberian leader Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and was adamant he would not budge until the Supreme Court had heard his challenge to the poll result."The so-called deadline of 19th January 2017 is not cast in stone and all parties shall await the outcome of the Supreme Court," he said on state television.Leaders of neighbouring countries and the Economic Community Of West African States (Ecowas) have repeatedly called on the long-serving strongman to leave office peacefully, so far to no avail.As well as Sirleaf, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari and Ghana's ex-president John Mahama have appealed to Jammeh to step down twice in person, without success, most recently on Friday.Barrow was the surprise guest at a Bamako summit over the weekend, where he was welcomed as a head of state and introduced to several world leaders.The prospect of military intervention in The Gambia has even been floated in recent days, following declarations by the United Nations and African Union that boots on the ground could get the green light without a rapid resolution of the crisis.The head of the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel said on Friday that Ecowas would ask the Security Council to approve the deployment of troops to The Gambia if Jammeh continues to refuse to leave office.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
