The medicine shortage affected basic products including insulin and some medicines used to treat diabetes - 17 percent of adult Egyptians have the disease, according to official figures.It also impacted some medicines used to treat heart disease, cancer, and solutions used in dialysis.It is difficult to assess the military's share in the economy and details of its budget cannot be published.Responding to criticism that the military's involvement in the economy is crowding out the private sector, Sisi said in December that it only accounts for 1.5% to 2%of the country's economic output.Sisi also defended the military's role, saying it was not doing so to enrich itself, but to assist in controlling price hikes working alongside the private sector.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
