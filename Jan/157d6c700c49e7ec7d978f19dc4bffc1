The LNA repelled it and since then has frequently bombarded the base, calling it a den of "terrorists".On Monday, an LNA air strike hit a military plane carrying senior Misrata military and political figures who were flying out of Al-Jufra, killing one and wounding several.The Misrata militias dispatched reinforcements to Al-Jufra as well as the Sebha region further west.Martin Kobler, the UN special envoy to Libya, said he was "alarmed by the tensions in Libya's south" and urged all sides "to act with restraint and to resolve issues through peaceful dialogue".US State Department spokesperson John Kirby warned that further fighting could embolden the Islamic State group and other jihadists to reorganise."We note with deep concern... renewed fighting between Libyans... fighting which we believe will only benefit Daesh [IS] and other violent extremists there," he said."The truth is that to date, Libyan forces have made progress against Daesh in Sirte and in eastern Libya, and that's what makes this renewed fighting here of concern," Kirby added.Despite the recapture of Sirte, which had been IS's main base in Libya, the jihadist threat persists in the country where experts say IS cells are present in several other areas including Tripoli.Hardliners win support&nbsp;Eljarh said a confrontation between Misrata and Haftar's forces could play out in Tripoli as well as the "oil crescent" and the southern region.Such an outcome "will have a knock-on effect on Libya's oil and water facilities adding to the suffering of the entire population especially in western Libya and the capital," he added.Eljarh said that the attack on the plane carrying Misrata dignitaries had inflamed even the most moderate factions in the western city."Hardliners ... have now managed to successfully switch public opinion within Misrata in their favour" and could now mobilise public support against the LNA, he added.Mattia Toaldo, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Haftar was trying to form alliances with Libya's powerful tribes to control the south of the country."The south is the most immediate flashpoint where Haftar is trying to replicate the strategy of tribal alliances and limited show of force that allowed him to capture the oil crescent in September," he said."Sirte is another flashpoint with Misratan fears that Haftar will use tribal allegiances to strip Misrata of its gains on the ground," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
