De Lille said the new Members of the Mayoral Committee (MMC) were appointed in line with the plan, and that some of the MMCs' portfolios had been amalgamated because they dealt with interrelated issues. She also announced that the city had been divided into four geographical areas - with four "mini mayors" overseeing these.De Lille said in her letter to Maimane that the responsibility of a two-thirds majority weighed heavily on her. "Taking Cape Town to the next level of government is an exciting prospect, but one that will take all of my time."As we position the party to be the next national government, I believe that those of us in government and other spheres have a duty to build the party&rsquo;s experience in, and capacity for, public management in preparation for effective custodianship of the state," she said.De Lille also told the Cape Argus that she had no plans to run for the position of premier in 2019.I've resigned as @Our_DA Western Cape leader.
