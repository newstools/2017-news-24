Nor could it establish the financial value of the agreement with TNA Media.It did say it was obvious that the SABC, while it was facing financial difficulties, appeared to have signed exclusive contracts to distribute a newspaper subscription on a national scale."All potential misleading or contradictory evidence relating to SABC board minutes, commercially sensitive documentation not provided, costs incurred by the SABC in hosting the TNA breakfast show... must be further investigated by the SABC interim board/Parliament and sanctions applied where proof of perjury is proven," the document reads.Ad hoc committee member Steve Swart told News24 on Wednesday that the working document had no legal standing yet. He expected it to be amended substantially during the committee&rsquo;s meeting on Thursday.Swart said contradictions during testimonies regarding the alleged Gupta/SABC deals deserved a forensic investigation.Democratic Alliance MP Phumzile van Damme said in a statement on Wednesday that the party was studying the working document. It was a "a good start" and needed more work, she said.SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago could not be reached for comment at the time of publication. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
