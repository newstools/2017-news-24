But to get residents to follow the Level 3 restrictions, which ban watering the garden or washing the car with drinking water, the city says it needs help. ''Given that the City supplies water to close to one million customers and that most wastage occurs behind closed doors, we need residents to help us and to report and supply evidence of alleged transgressions,'' a statement said. Water restriction contraventions can be reported to: water.restrictions@capetown.gov.za. The city said that since the implementation of water restrictions, 383 notices of contraventions and 225 notices to appear in court have been issued. Fines can go as high as R10 000. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
