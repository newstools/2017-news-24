Chinese-manufactured locomotives has hit a stumbling block as technical
problems have plagued the first of the trains to arrive in South Africa. News24 can reveal that the alternators of the first two
diesel locomotives delivered to Transnet by CRRC Corporation, China's
state-owned rail behemoth, posed serious problems soon after they arrived in
South Africa last year, rendering the locomotives unable to operate. Transnet is now refusing to accept a further 18 locomotives
that are waiting to be shipped to South Africa. The locomotives' alternators
"vibrate excessively", say sources familiar with the development. Alarmingly, problems with the alternators of similar
Chinese-manufactured locomotives ordered by Namibia in 2004 played a role in
that country's decision to stop using them. An alternator is one of the most crucial components on a
diesel locomotive, as it generates the power that moves the train forward. Transnet, however, maintains that the locomotives are still
at "prototype stage" and that CRRC "has resolved the problem
successfully". Problems from 'day one' In 2014 Transnet, under then CEO Brian Molefe, placed the
largest order for locomotives in South Africa's history when it awarded a
tender worth R50bn to four international original equipment manufacturers
(OEMs) for 1 064 new locomotives. The tender was split between China North Rail (CNR, 232
diesel locomotives at R7.8bn), China South Rail (CSR, 359 electric locomotives
at R14.6bn), General Electric (GE, 233 diesel locomotives at R7.1 bn) and
Bombardier (240 electric locomotives at R10.4bn). The overall contract cost of
R50bn includes a provision for hedging and cost escalation. CNR and CSR merged to form CRRC, the world's largest
manufacturer of rail equipment, after the tender was awarded. CRRC's first two class 45 diesel locomotives arrived in
Durban in August last year. According to several sources familiar with the
matter, the locomotives' alternators caused problems from day one. A team from Transnet will now travel to China in February in
order to verify whether CRRC could fix the problem on the 18 other locomotives
that have been completed and are waiting to be shipped. The 2014 tender was awarded on the strict condition that the
OEMs manufacture the bulk of the locomotives in South Africa using South
African-produced components, but CRRC has been allowed to manufacture the first
20 of the 232 diesel locomotives in China. 'Common phenomena' Mike Asefovits, a senior manager at Transnet's corporate
affairs division, said the vibrating alternators are not cause for concern. "The manufacturing process is at prototype stage and
this is when you pick up niggles and fix them. It is common phenomena that from
design to build to test there will always be a measure of technical issues that
might arise," said Asefovits. He said such issues are generally resolved
during testing and commissioning. However three sources familiar with Transnet's huge contract
say that CRRC has already completed 20 of the class 45 locomotives indicates
that the project is past its prototype phase. "Excessive vibration is a huge issue. The machines
essentially failed their first test. Those 18 locomotives in China are
completed, they're sitting on the docks in China ready to be shipped here, so I
don't understand how Transnet can view them as prototypes," says one
source. According to another source, the problem is that CRRC is
using technology it is not familiar with, such as the MTU diesel engines that
power the alternators and the Chinese-manufactured alternators themselves. "The Chinese won the bid with bid documents that
indicated they would use alternators manufactured by ABB [a Swiss technology
group based in Zurich], but they ended up using Chinese-manufactured
alternators," says one source. The decision to use alternators from a different
manufacturer was an attempt to cut costs, the source maintains. Repair costs According to Asefovits, the Transnet team travelling to
China in February will "validate technologies and sub-systems". The trip is "part of the contractual and costed
process", said Asefovits. He added that Transnet will not carry the repair
costs. "The cost of repair is not a Transnet problem. Such
costs are for the OEM concerned," said Asefovits. Strangely, CRRC maintains that it has not yet handed over
the locomotives to Transnet, despite several media reports on a handing over
ceremony held in Durban in August 2016. "The first two D45 locomotives [that] arrived in South
Africa are still in type testing stage and they are not handed over to Transnet
yet," CRRC SA Rolling Stock said in an email. The company has vowed to
provide further information on the faulty alternators. The development comes in the wake of a disastrous
locomotives contract awarded to the former China North Rail by TransNamib,
Namibia's national rail operator. TransNamib bought four diesel locomotives from China North
Rail in 2004, but ended up selling them in 2014 after a host of technical
problems rendered them unfit for use. TransNamib told The Namibian newspaper that "interface
problems between engine and alternator", along with "poor braking and
poor filtration systems", counted among the technical problems. * Do you have information for our investigative journalists?
