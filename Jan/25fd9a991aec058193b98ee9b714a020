"Inciting violence: this guy thinks that it is OK to tell people to burn white owned farms in CT," posted a user, who tagged the SA Human Rights Commission."How disgusting is this post!" another wrote. But in an interview with News24 on Friday, Maasdorp denied inciting violence.READ: Fires damage 4 rondavels at Goudini Spa resort'We must thank God in good and bad times'His view is that, because wind and fire are God-given elements, they could provide a sense of justice from the perspective of black people deprived of their land up to 400 years ago. "We are grateful when God responds to black oppression," said Maasdorp.He said that if farmers felt blessed by God when it rained on their fields, then oppressed black people could feel blessed if white-owned farms burnt down. "We must thank God in good and bad times," he said, adding that the fires could be seen by the oppressed as proof that God existed. He denied starting any of the fires or inciting anyone to do so.On Monday, Co-operative Government and Traditional Affairs Minister Des Van Rooyen said the fires were most likely started by people and an investigation&nbsp;into this was&nbsp;underway, But Enviro Wildfire Services, a private company which does forensic investigations into fires for insurance companies, cautioned against blaming anybody without evidence.A company spokesperson could not immediately take a call as he was working at&nbsp;a flare-up line, but a company statement estimated that damages so far could be&nbsp;more than&nbsp;R100m.Cause of fires still unknownThe fires could have been started by a cooking fire, burning the outer coating off copper wires or children playing - any manner of causes must be considered, the company said. Merely being spotted running away from a fire did not mean that person was an arsonist, it cautioned.More than 100 Working on Fire firefighters have been at the fireline for two weeks, with naval officers from Simon's Town bolstering their forces this week. Helicopters, fixed wing aircraft and residents have all been working to put the fires out.Meanwhile on Friday, SA National Parks fire manager Phillip Prins said that the wind changing to a south-easter had caused a flare-up in Glencairn, near Simon's Town, and another flare-up closer to the town.
