It has been delay, after delay, after delay," she said, her voice quivering with emotion.If it was up to the ANC, this matter would have dragged until eternity, she said.Bolani also told the court that she had to represent herself in the matter because none of the legal firms she had approached wanted to risk going up against the ANC, out of fear of losing business with both the party and the state.Counsel for the ANC , Advocate Frans Nalane, claimed there was no proof that the party was involved in the agreement, but the businesswoman insisted that the ANC had knowledge of her company&rsquo;s role in its R50m covert campaign, with its general manger, Ignatius Jacobs, signing off on the agreement on an official ANC document.'Committed to running clean campaigns'ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa released a statement after the ruling, claiming the party had no contract with Bolani and had never appointed her to represent the ANC or do communication work for it."The African National Congress has always been, and remains, committed to running clean campaigns in all the elections we have participated in since 1994," said the party.When asked about claims that the ANC&rsquo;s general manager had signed off on the agreement, Kodwa said that only one PR company had been hired."Perhaps when we get to the merits of the case, the ANC representative [legal] will clarify," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
