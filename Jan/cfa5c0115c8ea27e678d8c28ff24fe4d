We approached court and they granted us today the order that the appointment of Bambo was irregular," said Buthane.In and out of courtWhen the court made&nbsp;the ruling on Tuesday Bambo had already been removed from his position&nbsp;during a&nbsp;special council meeting on Monday.The municipality has been in and out of court since the sacking of&nbsp;14 ANC councillors after they voted in support of an&nbsp;opposition party motion to remove an allegedly&nbsp;corrupt mayor in 2014.&nbsp;Buthane said the ANC no longer respected the rule of law, adding that the EFF would challenge any action that seeks to undermine the law.It is alleged that tenders worth R235m were issued during Bambo's tenure following his appointment in October.The municipal manager post has been vacant for the past three years.Former municipal manager Willie Kekana is challenging his sacking in court.Kekana was dismissed in 2015&nbsp;when Makhurupetje's department intervened.Makhurupetje and ANC councillors had&nbsp;questioned Kekana's contract status, claiming it was illegal.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
