The commander in chief is meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the combatant commanders. He says he's doing everything possible to ensure the next president "will benefit from the same kind of outstanding advice and service." The president is pointing to the fight against the Islamic State group in the Iraqi city of Mosul and in Syria as ongoing conflicts the next president will inherit. He says Afghanistan, too, is still active. Obama offered praise and gratitude for US military leaders.
