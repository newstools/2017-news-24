"President Buhari is the chief mediator in the crisis and he is committed to ensuring that the logjam is resolved," he added.Regional leaders on December 17 called on Jammeh to step down by this month when his term runs out and vowed to take "all necessary action to enforce the results".The 15 nations that make up the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) did not explain what that would entail and Jammeh accused the organisation of issuing a "declaration of war".A court case filed by Jammeh seeking to annul the results of the December 1 poll has been adjourned at Gambia's top court until next week.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
