He was stripped of it in 2008, following outrage over rights abuses and election violence.&nbsp;Currently attending an AU summit in Ethiopia, the Zimbabwe leader hasn't publicly commented on Trump's election although officials close to him appear to be very pleased with it.Caesar Zvayi, the editor of the pro-Mugabe Herald newspaper tweeted triumphantly on Tuesday morning: "In US, the President chooses Supreme Court judges." That was an attempt to justify Mugabe's recent move to change the constitution so that he alone can appoint a new chief justice. Critics and the opposition are strongly opposed to this move.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
