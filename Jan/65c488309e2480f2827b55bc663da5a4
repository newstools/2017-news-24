His comments were widely viewed as support for outgoing African Union commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. The ANC Women's League has endorsed her to take over as party leader from her ex-husband.&ldquo;Anyone who is nominated can contest. There is no policy. It&rsquo;s not true that it&rsquo;s a tradition,&rdquo; Zuma said.Cosatu rejected Zuma&rsquo;s argument.&ldquo;It is very dangerous for leaders to play cute with the traditions and principles that have united and served the movement and stood the test of time, for short-term gains and narrow political interest.&rdquo;Cosatu, which has no voting rights within the ANC, but has influence, appears to be going for broke as the ANC succession battle intensifies ahead of its elective conference in December.It had refused to let the ANC censure it for openly backing deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa before the party opened its nomination process.Cosatu warned the party's leadership against making inconsistent arguments meant to malign opponents.&ldquo;The ANC&lsquo;s political neck is in the hangman&rsquo;s noose because of this myopia by those entrusted with leading. Unless the movement abandons this unsettling tendency of treating disagreements as warfare, we can forget about achieving the much-needed unity and the 2019 elections,&rdquo; Cosatu said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
