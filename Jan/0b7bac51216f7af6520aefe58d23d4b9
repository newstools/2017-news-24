"I think it would&rsquo;ve gone down really well, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; he said, laughing.Hofmeyr might soon meet the US&rsquo;s controversial new leader if a petition and fund-raising campaign created by Afrikaner right wing group Kommando Sorg reaches its R100 000 target.The group, which Hofmeyr says has already raised more than R20 000, reckons a meeting between him and Trump would help &ldquo;grant the white people of South Africa their independence&rdquo;.In a recent interview discussing the fundraising campaign, Hofmeyr said he &ldquo;may be the only artist in the galaxy willing to perform at Trump&rsquo;s inauguration&rdquo;. Since the details of Trump&rsquo;s inauguration emerged, big stars such as Elton John and R Kelly have publicly refused to perform at his inauguration.&ldquo;I want to get this clear, though: I&rsquo;m not a Donald Trump groupie. But I am elated that he was elected,&rdquo; Hofmeyr said. &ldquo;He breaks the mould. You know, I love paradigm changes and shifts, and I think that, more than anyone else, he represents this important time in history. "I like the idea that the world is finally agreeing that he isn&rsquo;t just for the &lsquo;extreme right&rsquo;, but that we are all becoming more politically cautious. &ldquo;I get blamed for being right wing, but that comes from a lot of people who are getting exposed in 2016, like the mass media.&rdquo; &ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; he laments, &ldquo;I am often treated the same way that Donald Trump is treated.&rdquo; Hofmeyr will be watching the ceremony and keeping a close eye on Trump&rsquo;s presidency, he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do what I can to try to watch the inauguration, but if I have a second, I would really like to see how he&rsquo;s going to do an inauguration ceremony without entertainment, particularly as a performing artist. &ldquo;I actually can&rsquo;t wait for the next few years. It started with Brexit &ndash; and I made a lot of friends with that &ndash; and now the Trump victory.&rdquo; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
