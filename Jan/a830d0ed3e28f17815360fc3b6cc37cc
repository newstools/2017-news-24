	     Durban – A Durban man has urged fellow motorists to beware of criminals throwing stones and bricks at vehicles from overhead bridges. Mduduzi Nxumalo on Monday took to Facebook posting images of his ordeal that apparently took place on the N2 under the Higginson Highway Bridge, south of Durban. His post, which included pictures of the damage to his vehicle, was shared more than 100 times by Tuesday. Speaking to News24, Nxumalo said he had been travelling on the road around midday on Monday when the incident happened. "I heard a loud bang and for a moment thought someone was shooting at me. I thought it was a gun. Then I realised it was a stone. My windscreen glass shattered and hit my face. Luckily I wear glasses, which saved my eyes. I tried not to panic and hit any other cars." According to Nxumalo and news reports, this was not the first time that this had occurred in the area. "I have heard of this happening to others before. Someone once told me a log was thrown onto their vehicle." Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said they had not received any reports of stone throwing from bridges. "We are appealing to those affected to please report to the nearest police station so that the matter will be investigated." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
