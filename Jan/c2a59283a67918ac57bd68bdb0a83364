It also encouraged member states to require that airlines provide advance passenger information to national authorities to make sure the travel ban is enforced.France's UN Ambassador Francois Delattre, whose country drafted the resolution, said extending sanctions is justified because of "the persisting threat of various militias that continue to try to derail the process of stabilization and reconciliation.""It's a very important signal to all those in the Central African Republic who try to undermine the political process," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
