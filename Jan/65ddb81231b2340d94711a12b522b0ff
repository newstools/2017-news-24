Zimbabwe's police demand fines are paid on the spot, despite the current cash shortages. Locals complain that police sometimes pre-set speed cameras and extort fines for nebulous offences like not having a long enough piece of reflective tape along the side of a cab or having a dirty car.&nbsp;By way of comparison, the UK was reported in 2014 to have amassed a total of $55m from speeding fines over a four-year period, according to the Telegraph.&nbsp;The state ZBC broadcaster said on Tuesday that police will soon have swipe machines at roadblocks so that fines can be paid with a bank card.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
