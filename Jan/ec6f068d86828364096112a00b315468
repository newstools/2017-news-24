This leaves a very low margin of safety, as it is difficult to abstract the last 10% of a dam's volume," Reddy said.The City asked residents to report water wastage."With a population in the region of four million people and significant water wastage occurring behind closed doors, the City cannot effectively enforce these restrictions unless residents act as our eyes and ears on the ground." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
