When it split into three pieces the fossil skull was revealed.Fossil scannedThe fossil was kept in a cardboard box in an archive of a Cape Town museum until 2013, when the Wits Evolutionary Studies Institute obtained a micro-CT scanner.Soon, Gess was granted permission to begin scanning the fossil. Being remarkably intact, it allowed for a clear view of the interior of the braincase.&ldquo;We spent days getting the best possible scans. It scanned incredibly well, so our team were able to create a perfect 3D digital image of the skull, inside and out.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their research showed that indeed the Dwykaselachus was not just one of plenty of fish in the sea. It proved to be the first specimen to reveal both features of certain primitive &ldquo;sharks&rdquo; and of chimaeras.The scans allowed Gess to trace the early development of these fish as they diverged from their deep, shared ancestry with sharks.&ldquo;We can now anchor chimaeras firmly on the tree of vertebrate life,&rdquo; explained Gess.The Dwykaselachus shares features of symmoriid sharks, &ldquo;a bizarre group of 300+ million-year-old sharks, known for their unusual dorsal fin spines, with some resembling boom-like prongs and others surreal ironing boards&rdquo;. The scans, however, revealed that they also carried a series of tell-tale anatomical structures that marked the specimen as an early chimaera.Remarkable specimenAnd the Dwykaselachus&nbsp;has netted interest across international seas. Lead author of the study, Dr Mike Coates, serves as a professor of organismal biology and anatomy at the University of Chicago.&ldquo;When I saw it for the first time, I was stunned.&nbsp;The specimen is remarkable,&rdquo; Coates said.The 50 living species of chimaera found in the world today have, in fact, now evolved very differently to sharks.&nbsp;They have large eyes and tooth plates, adapted for grinding prey.Known in South Africa as Josef, St Joseph, or elephant sharks, they generally live deep in the ocean but come to shallow waters to breed in summer.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
