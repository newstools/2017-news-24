"I never use the word, it&rsquo;s so rude," he says, while the others laugh.&nbsp;According to Simpson, the pupils are apparently members of a band and had described the song as "dark humour". &nbsp;&nbsp;"I am deeply disappointed, because this is not the sort of behaviour we try to foster at the school," Simpson said."What is encouraging though, is that it upset other boys to such an extent that they approached me with proof. There is an overwhelming feeling of anger in the school community because of the incident."The boys&rsquo; parents were summoned to the school. Simpson said he pointed out the seriousness of the transgression, and that it amounted to hate speech and contravened, not only the school&rsquo;s code of conduct, but also the Constitution.&nbsp;'Boys must learn their lesson early in life'The boy who wrote, sang and published the song, and the second one who was present, have been taken out of the school.The third boy made the second recording in which he used the offensive word. His father said that his son should face a disciplinary hearing. It would probably be held on Tuesday."It is a very serious matter and the boys must learn their lesson early in life," he said.A furious parent who contacted&nbsp;Cape Talk&rsquo;s John Maytham and sent him the recordings, claimed that two teachers at the school had called Chinese pupils "ching chong" and Indian pupils "Pakistanis".&nbsp;In response, Simpson said he could not deny it might have happened, but he could not take action unless someone came forward with information or proof.&nbsp;The Western Cape Education Department said it was aware of the incident and that the parent who had complained about the two teachers had been asked to provide further details.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
