The group has asked drivers and donkey owners for feedback."We need to see if the collars affect the donkeys in any way before we do more," says Hood. "Will they rub on their skin or get caught on objects? [We need to see] how they 'wear and tear'."&nbsp;"The owners have been very positive and greatly appreciate any efforts made to protect their donkeys as well as helping to avoid accidents that could cause injuries or loss of human life," she added.Fatal donkey/driver accidents tend to occur on the highways leading into Beitbridge, involving buses, lorries and drivers travelling at night.Anecdotal evidence suggests night driving in Zimbabwe has increased in recent months as locals try to avoid the many police roadblocks.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
