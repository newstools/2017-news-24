Meetings and conversations were recorded.The US indictment describes Baktash Akasha as "the leader of an organised crime family in Kenya" and his younger brother Ibrahim as his "deputy". It also describes "Old Man" Hussein as "the head of a transportation network that distributes massive quantities of narcotics throughout the Middle East and Africa", while "Vicky" Goswami "manages the Akasha Organisation's drug business".The men are accused of conspiring to import pure "white crystal" heroin into the US at a knock-down price of around $10,000 (9,100 euros) a kilo.US officials believe the Akasha brothers are continuing the business of their late father, also named Ibrahim, who was described in a secret 2006 US diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks as a "drug baron".He was killed in Amsterdam - shot four times by a bicycle-riding assassin - in May 2000 as he took a morning stroll with his wife along Blood Street in the city's Red Light District.Over the last two years the extradition request has foundered in Kenya's courts while the four suspects have been out on bail.Defence lawyer Cliff Ombeta has insisted on his clients' innocence and on Tuesday said he did not know the whereabouts of his clients.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
