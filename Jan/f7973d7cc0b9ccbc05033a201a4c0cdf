According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the African elephant population recorded its biggest drop in a quarter century last year, with an estimated population of 415 000 elephants...111 000 fewer than a decade ago. And the killing continues at the dizzying pace of about 30 000 elephants a year.The rhinoceros fares worse. Black market rhino horn sells for up to $60 000 per kilogramme - more than gold or cocaine - and in the last eight years alone roughly a quarter of the world population has been killed in South Africa, home to 80% of the remaining animals.The International Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species estimates the illegal wildlife trade is worth $20bn a year, making it the fourth biggest illicit activity after guns, drugs and human trafficking.Legitimate businesses"Protecting the world's wildlife heritage is our collective responsibility as global citizens and as international law enforcement," Stock said.The project will also tackle large-scale illegal fishing, whose networks have developed over the past 10 years, Interpol said."Illegal fishing is also often linked to human trafficking with crews subjected to labour and human rights abuses, fraud in regulatory systems and corruption, damaging legitimate businesses and economies," the international body added.The project will be supported by the United States Agency for International Development and the International Consortium on Combatting Wildlife Crime.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
