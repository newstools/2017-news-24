We&rsquo;re not sure how exactly she fell down the cliff, but she apparently had issues with her mental health," said the unit&rsquo;s operations manager, Danie Theron.The woman told the rescue team that she had been stranded on the cliff for two days. She had a broken elbow, an injury to the back of her head, and was severely dehydrated."It&rsquo;s miraculous that she survived the fall, and was very lucky that she ended up on a small ledge, instead of falling further down the mountain," said Theron.A rescue team was able get to about 6m below the ledge, before climbing up the cliff and setting up a rope system to bring the woman to safety.Mpumalanga health department spokesperson Christopher Nobela said she was recovering in a local hospital."Unfortunately, the fact that she is a psychiatric patient means that it&rsquo;s difficult to establish from her exactly how she fell off the cliff. We are just thankful that she survived," Nobela said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
