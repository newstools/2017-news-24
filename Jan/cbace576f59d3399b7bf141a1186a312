He said he did not know how the ANCWL had overlooked this fact."We read the Daily Sun, like everyone else in South Africa. We read the allegations that she was drunk while giving speeches and thought it was interesting," he said.According to the article, Dlamini was unsteady on her feet. The ANCWL, however, said she was sober and had stood throughout her address on challenges facing the league&rsquo;s young women&rsquo;s desk.The ANCWL threatened to take The Citizen to the Press Ombudsman if it failed to take responsibility for the issue.Daily Sun editor Reggy Moalusi said the paper did its due diligence before publishing the story."We were fair to the minister. We called for comment. We spoke to her spokesperson, Lumka Oliphant."He said Oliphant&rsquo;s response was included in the story.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
