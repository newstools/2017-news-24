(File) Multimedia &nbsp; &nbsp; User Galleries &nbsp; &nbsp; News in Pictures Send us your pictures &nbsp; &nbsp; Send us your stories Former DA councillor Clive Lotz, who jumped ship late last year and moved to the ANC, is believed to have landed a cushy job at Msunduzi Municipality.Lotz, who resigned as the Ward 32 councillor and joined the ANC a month after the local government elections, is now, according to numerous sources, the manager at the Speaker&rsquo;s office.Several sources at the City Hall alleged that Lotz has been paid for being in that post since December but has allegedly yet to report for duty. He is said to be earning around R40 000 a month.It is not clear whether Lotz is qualified for the job or whether it was advertised.The job usually requires a degree in public administration or political science and &ldquo;proven experience in a similar position&rdquo;.A source at City Hall, who asked not to be named, confirmed that Lotz had been appointed in December but has not shown up to the office since the appointment.The source said that Blessing Dlamini, who was previously acting as manager of the Speaker&rsquo;s office, was continuing with his duties &ldquo;until told otherwise&rdquo;.&ldquo;Blessing has been doing all that he used to do although Lotz was appointed. We know that he [Lotz] was appointed but we have never seen him in the office to date,&rdquo; said the source.The source said Dlamini had been acting for 18 months but has not received his acting allowance since August.When contacted, Dlamini said he could not comment on the matter and referred all queries to the municipal spokesperson.Numerous attempts to get comment from the municipality since Monday were unsuccessful. The municipality&rsquo;s acting spokesperson, Siyabonga Hlongwa, did not reply to queries sent to him and also did not answer his phone nor SMSes from The Witness.Both municipal speaker Jabu Ngubo and acting municipal manager Sizwe Hadebe did not answer their phones nor reply to SMS queries sent to them.Lotz made history by taking the ward from the ANC in August.The ward, which incorporates Woodlands, had never been won by any party other than the ANC in previous democratic elections.Lotz, however, stunned the electorate in November when he resigned and joined the ANC. This left the ward councillor post vacant and by-elections are to be held there next month.At that time Lotz said he had resigned because there were no coloured people represented in the DA caucus.Now, KZN DA deputy leader Mergan Chetty believes the defection by Lotz was not about racial representation, but about the promise of a job.DA caucus leader in the municipality Sibongiseni Majola said if it is true that Lotz has been employed by the municipality, it would mean he is being compensated for his political move.&ldquo;There are processes when it comes to recruitment. The post must be vacant and must be advertised,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We will ask for the names of the shortlisted candidates, date of interviews and job requirements.&ldquo;Is he qualified? Were there no other candidates that were best suited for the job?&ldquo;It is clear that him moving to the ANC was not about coloured people not being given opportunities in the DA ranks. He was given the deputy chief whip position in Msunduzi as a coloured. He was also given the opportunity to represent in district.&rdquo;IFP caucus leader Thinasonke Ntombela said he would follow up with the municipality to find out if it is true that Lotz had been employed and whether the job had been advertised.Asked if it was true that he defected to the ANC because of a job promise, Lotz said whoever was making that allegation was entitled to their opinion, and said he would not comment further. He was asked to comment twice but declined.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
