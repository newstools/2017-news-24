Our flag will now fly high among those of the most democratic nations of the world." A small, narrow enclave of Senegal except for its coast, The Gambia is the smallest country on the African continent.It has been ruled by Jammeh for 22 years, an era marked by chronic poverty and human-rights abuse.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
