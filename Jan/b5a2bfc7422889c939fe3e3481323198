Rasila said the delay had been caused by the appointment of a new service provider for the deliveries."Kgetjepe was gloating about the successfully executed textbook delivery for the 2017 school year during the release of 2016 National Senior Certificate results for Limpopo last week in Polokwane, but the reality is that the department has failed to do its job and has let down thousands of poor learners across Limpopo."The sad truth is that the department continues to lack the capacity and the political will to prioritise learning."The DA will not give up until every school in Limpopo receives the textbooks it needs to teach our children," said Smalle.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
