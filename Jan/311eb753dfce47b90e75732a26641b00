However, she excelled in her remaining eight subjects: Mathematics, Life Orientation, Physical Science, Art, Drama, English (home language), and Afrikaans (first additional language). Lily-Marie, who initially lived in England, moved to South Africa with her parents, Johan, a medical doctor, and Gillian, an anaesthetist, when she was a baby.She speaks English with a British accent that she says she picked up from her mother.She credits her Afrikaans teacher, Pieter Schuurman, with helping her perform well in a subject that she had struggled with."He became my Afrikaans teacher at the start of my Grade 11 year. At the time, I only managed to achieve 60s for the subject, but with his guidance, I managed to reach 85%," she said.Lily-Marie also has a creative flair and, during the first years of her high school career, she did many pencil drawings - predominantly of animals."At that stage, I wanted to become an animation artist. I enjoyed participating in my school&rsquo;s drama plays, and I also took music theory classes, as well as classical guitar lessons."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
