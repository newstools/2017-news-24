The acid attack left him maimed and disabled from the neck down. He also lost his ear, an eye and part of his lip. Rebecca Maleka, a school friend of Wallace, said she studied fashion design in the UK. &ldquo;That is an evil woman,&rdquo; Bartje van Dongen, Mark&rsquo;s brother, told City Press&rsquo; sister newspaper Rapport from Breda in the Netherlands. &ldquo;The police have a strong case against her. There is evidence that the attack was planned long before it took place,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She searched the internet for information on how to disfigure a person with sulphuric acid and there is evidence that she had bought the acid.&ldquo;While he was in hospital, Mark told me and my father that Berlinah visited him at his home in Bristol [in the UK] and that she pocketed his key without his knowledge when she left.&ldquo;She later came back when he was asleep. She woke him up and told him that if she couldn&rsquo;t have him, nobody could.&ldquo;She then poured the acid over him while he was in bed,&rdquo; said Bartje.Mark jumped out of bed and, with only his boxer shorts on, ran down the street screaming in pain for help. At first his neighbours thought he was on drugs, but later called an ambulance when they realised he had been burnt with acid. Wallace was subsequently arrested. &ldquo;She did not want to accept that he had left her. He was scared of her and was living in fear for his life,&rdquo; said Bartje.The couple met in the UK after Mark moved there six years ago to study engineering at the University of Bristol. &ldquo;Our family is broken. Mark was a lovely, friendly and intelligent person. All we can hope for now is that justice will be done,&rdquo; said Bartje. &ndash; Rapport 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
