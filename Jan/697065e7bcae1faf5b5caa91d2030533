The board is not there, and whatever is happening now at the SABC, it's only the executive which takes decisions," he said, adding that whatever decisions are made by the executive would be difficult to reverse.READ: Don&rsquo;t drop the ball on SABCChief whips to decide on namesEconomic Freedom Fighters MP Floyd Shivambu suggested that it be left to the chief whips' forum."I wanted to suggest that we perhaps subject the process or consultation of names to the chief whips, instead of us coming with so many names here and discussing them. Because we are not even interviewing those people," he said.It would not be difficult for the chief whips to establish common ground and agree on five names, he said.His suggestion was agreed to by committee members. Possible board members would be discussed at the next chief whips' meeting, thereafter the names would be brought to the committee for adoption.The committee would then take the names to the National Assembly. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
