Trump gave an amber light to the Keystone XL pipeline - which would carry crude from Canada to US refineries on the Gulf Coast - and an equally controversial pipeline crossing in North Dakota. But he said both would be constructed subject to renegotiated terms and conditions. "It is subject to a renegotiation of terms, by us," he said of the Keystone project. "We are going to renegotiate some of the terms and, if they like, we'll see if we can get that pipeline built." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
