Tenants lost an appeal against the recent eviction order, and previously had until September 9 to move out.Reclaim the City last week rejected the City of Cape Town's indication that it could accommodate the evictees in state-subsidised housing schemes in Wolwerivier near Melkbos &ndash; around 30km outside the CBD."We have visited Wolwerivier and nobody can live a decent life there. As during the forced removals of apartheid, our families will be uprooted from our communities, and lose access to jobs, good schools and healthcare," evictees' spokesperson Charnell Commando said previously in a statement. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
