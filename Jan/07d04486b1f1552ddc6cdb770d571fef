My parents are poor and I don't want my dream to die because of poverty," he said.Mqiti, who will be doing Grade 12 this year, and plans to study chemical engineering, said he had learned how to make the herbal mouthwash from his father, who had been taught by his late father."I come from a family of herbalists. The family has been using this product for many generations and we have never had teeth or gum problems. I turned a family secret into a profitable business," he said.Mqiti said five special herbs are boiled to produce a strong tea, before vinegar is added, which helps to preserve the mouthwash. He sells 1l for R250."I advise my customers to rinse their mouths twice a day until the bottle is finished. The mouthwash is more effective when warm to hot," he said.Chris Malatjie said he suffered from gum disease, which had led to the loss of two teeth."A friend told me about Mqiti's traditional mouthwash and, after a week of using it, my gums healed and my teeth became strong. It gave me back a beautiful smile," he said.Mackson Shikwambana said he preferred the homemade herbal mouthwash to the commercial versions.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
