The campaign by the capture crew is in full steam. https://t.co/G4BYZbHRzN"It&rsquo;s all coming from what&rsquo;s called an automated Twitterbot, so it&rsquo;s a very orchestrated propaganda campaign. It is broad and linked to people in the Oakbay set of companies."This weekend&rsquo;s campaign was actually hashtagged Oakbay so it wasn&rsquo;t too difficult to surmise where it is from," Haffajee said.She said she would be investigating the origins of the tweets and those behind the account. So far, she had reported those she had seen to the social network."I reported it to Twitter. I recorded all the ones I could find and they say it has to come from the actual company. So I think those companies are going to start doing it. But I think there are so many thousands of them that it&rsquo;s a very difficult thing to do."From @Twitter Twitter allows parody, commentary, and fan accounts...in full compliance with our parody, commentary, fan account policy.&mdash; Ferial Haffajee (@ferialhaffajee) January 21, 2017From @Twitter Twitter allows parody, commentary, and fan accounts...in full compliance with our parody, commentary, fan account policy.Commenting on the trend of fake news that appeared to be on the rise, Haffajee said, "Technology has made it really simple to create fake sites, and they&rsquo;re not parodies... These are actual fake news sites meant to deceive the public."All you need is a free design tool on a computer and not even very great skills, if you look at some of the work. So technology has made it cheap to do. I think we&rsquo;re just in an era of fake news now, where people either want to sow confusion and propaganda or they have a specific purpose."She urged all journalists and media houses to start analysing the accounts."I think it&rsquo;s worth engaging Twitter in a more coherent, bigger form.
