He was initially charged with "undermining the authority of the nonagenarian".Mugadza was later charged with "criminal nuisance" before he was finally charged with "insulting people of a certain race or religion".Mtisi said Mgadza was expected to appear in court on Wednesday and would plead not guilty.He said the pastor had no regrets "at all" for making the prophesy."He's admitting to the facts. He says he didn&rsquo;t lie &ndash; that&rsquo;s a message from God. Police will have to prove God didn&rsquo;t say it." &nbsp;Mugadza first came to prominence in December 2015 when he was arrested for staging a one-man protest against Mugabe in Victoria Falls.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
