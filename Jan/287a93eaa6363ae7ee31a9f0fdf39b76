The east of the country remains a battleground for rival ethnic militias.Kabila took office his father Laurent was assassinated in 2001 at the height of the Second Congo War.He was confirmed as leader in 2006 during the first free elections since independence from Belgium in 1960, and re-elected for a second term in 2011 in a vote marred by accusations of fraud.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
