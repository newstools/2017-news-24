According to data released on Wednesday, the city had 335 homicides in 2016. The city's record low was 333 in 2014. Police officials reported 998 shooting incidents in 2016 and overall crime was also at its lowest. Crime continues to drop even as police make fewer arrests for low-level infractions now handled through tickets. They've also reduced use of the stop-and-frisk technique. Police Commissioner James O'Neill says the numbers "are not by accident" and they are the result of careful police strategies and increased work with communities. Modern record keeping began in the late 1990s with the creation of the department's crime-tracking data system. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
