But, said Nzimande, there were "opportunistic forces trying to hijack" the protests.He emphasised the need to continue talking to all those affected to promote stability."This means that those student leaders and organisations genuinely concerned about access and affordability should maintain high levels of vigilance, as there are opportunists in their midst, ready to hijack their noble cause." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
