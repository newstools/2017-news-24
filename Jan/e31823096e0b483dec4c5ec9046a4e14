It went off and hit her face," said Mahwasane.The area was once a battleground&nbsp;between freedom fighters and the apartheid government,&nbsp;which resulted in communities&nbsp;living near to the military base being removed to make way for a buffer zone around it."Our communities are not safe. We are very worried that we never know where bombs were left," said Mahwasane "We are not safe, government should help remove bombs."Early last year, a civilian was killed when harvesting scrap metals at the military base.
