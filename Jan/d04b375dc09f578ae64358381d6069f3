The stalwarts are still pushing for the two to be separated.On Tuesday Ntuli said: "The current environment requires that we close ranks and come out with a uniting leadership in December 2017."He said that&nbsp;there&nbsp;should be an approach that all ANC members adopt, instead of calling for the leadership to step down."We are faced by many challenges already and we should avoid acting recklessly and in a manner that deepens our challenges... We believe very strongly that these [Motlanthe's] sentiments do not contribute to uniting the ANC," he said.During the interview on Monday night, Motlanthe also said "there are many women capable of leading the ANC" when asked about former African Union Commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma's possible candidacy.Motlanthe said factions pushing names of certain ANC leaders "take away the power of branches to elect who they wanted to lead the party, when it holds its national conference later this year".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
