Charnell Commando. She is a kitchen assistant in Observatory and now she's an expert."She doesn't know what the budget of the city council is; she doesn't know what money they get."She doesn't know this stuff, she is a kitchen assistant."Weinkove was referring to Commando, who is the evictee's spokesperson.Gasps from the galleryHe said a park she had identified was "ridiculous", and another erf of 94m2 was only big enough for a bachelor flat, as people in the benches exclaimed at his outburst.He wanted to know what would happen to people who had been waiting for more than 10 years to move to Woodstock, and asked about the developers who could not do any work until the matter was resolved.A balance was needed and locality could not be the issue if people were streaming into Cape Town on the freeway in their cars from as far away as Somerset West, he said.The residents and supporters gasped, shouting at Weinkove while court was still in session.He also wanted to know why he should be dealing with a municipal matter, and without a full bench."I must take over the job of the city council? What do you want me to go and investigate? Examine every one of these parcels of land?"I'm not qualified to do that."The Woodstock Hub intends building new rental units at prices of around R9 000 a month, which the original residents can't afford.They agreed to move when they were served with eviction notices, and some have done so, but 16 adults and 11 children say have nowhere else to go because of high rentals in the area.One of the residents, 76-year-old Brenda Smith, told News24 they paid R1 800 a month for their house in Bromwell Street, but they do not even have the average R15 000 deposit they needed to be able to rent somewhere else.The matter continues. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
