She would love to see a female South African president but it should not be a proxy, clearly she is insulting uNkosazana [Dlamini-Zuma]."Zuma said he was offended by Madonsela's remarks."She was addressing a white dominated gathering in Cape Town, she is a proxy herself."He said it was well known that Dlamini-Zuma was the preferred female candidate to succeed Zuma. If Dlamini-Zuma, who had the support of the ANC Women's League, were to succeed in her candidacy, she would likely go head-to-head with Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa for the top position. However, the party has yet to officially open the succession debate.Current Public Protector 'undermined'"My interest is the ANC, clearly the female candidate is known, it is Nkosazana, we all know that. Obviously if she says she does not want a president who is a proxy, she is referring to her, whose proxy is Nkosazana?"He questioned the CX report that Madonsela touched on during the briefing."That investigation is still in the office of the Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane. She is basically undermining Busisiwe, the current Public Protector."Zuma wondered who Madonsela was trying to impress.Madonsela could not be reached for comment after repeated attempts. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
