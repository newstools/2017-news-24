Lackay said he saw him regularly in the first month, but once Moyane had moved offices, he would be told that Moyane was not available whenever he tried to see him."From what you are saying, you did not establish a relationship with Commissioner Moyane and you were not interested in doing so," Sibuyi said.Lackay denied this, saying when Moyane was appointed, there had been no change in his duties.Sibuyi asked if Lackay had ever called and asked the commissioner where he was."I am his subordinate. If I am told he is not available, I accept that. I alerted him to what I needed to see him about by emailing him," Lackay said.Emails unansweredHe added that when he needed urgent responses to media queries, often his emails to Moyane went unanswered.Sibuyi said that because Lackay did not SMS or call Moyane, he could not know he was needed."How is the commissioner supposed to know you need him if you do not communicate with him? Is he supposed to be a sangoma or something?"Lackay repeated that he had emailed Moyane and had tried to see him repeatedly.In one email he told Moyane that he needed to be given information on what was happening with some serious matters, such as the suspensions of senior managers, in order for him to communicate with the media.Lackay indicated that, after resigning from SARS, he spent 18 months doing freelance work.He now has a contract at the Public Investment Corporation.Cross-examination will continue on Friday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
