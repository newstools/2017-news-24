'Reverse Racism' is a fantasy of white people who are keen to experience the kinds of oppression that they have used against indigenous people of this country,&rdquo; Hutton said.READ: 'F**k White People' exhibition racist &ndash; FF Plus&lsquo;Compromising humanity&rsquo;Hutton hoped that the exhibition would open white people&rsquo;s eyes to indoctrination.&ldquo;I am sure that many, and in particular the young people in your communities, have begun to wake from the indoctrination of white supremacy and are ready to learn to fuck the white in them too,&rdquo; Hutton said.&ldquo;Those that are tired of compromising their humanity in exchange for the stolen benefits of 500 years of white supremacy, colonialism and genocide are welcome to email me at yesfuckwhitepeople@fuckwhitepeople.org."In a reply to Hutton, Groenewald told News24 that the artist should&rsquo;ve expected critique.&ldquo;Everyone is entitled to their opinion, as well as the artist. If your artwork is offensive, and intended to [be offensive], as the artist mentions in the label, you must expect critique and reaction and not think that only an artist has the knowledge to criticise the work,&rdquo; Groenewald said.The National Art Gallery is yet to respond to request for comment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
