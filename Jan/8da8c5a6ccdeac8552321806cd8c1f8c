"The union officials today presented that offer to the doctors for deliberations and they humbly rejected it," the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) wrote on its Twitter account.The union said the offer failed to take into account other agreements mentioned in the CBA, from the need to better equip hospitals to funding research and addressing the security of doctors at work."The issue of discussion is not increase in salaries or allowances for that matter, it is implementation of the CBA," said cardiologist and union member Elijah Ogolla.KMPDU secretary general Ouma Oluga said that while the strike was still on, doctors were open to further negotiations.Another meeting between the government and the union officials was due to take place later on Friday.The strike has been devastating for sick Kenyans whose only other option is private healthcare, which is out of reach for most. Poor salaries and working conditions have led to an exodus of Kenyan doctors to other African countries and abroad, that prompted the Central Organisation of Trade Unions (COTU) to warn of "catastrophe" in the health sector in 2014.The strike has received wide support from the media and citizens on social networks.Editorials have called for government to pay doctors a decent wage and end the damaging strike, while Kenyans on Twitter point to endless corruption scandals while the doctors struggle for wage increases. The latest move to outrage the union was a decision by lawmakers just before Christmas to award themselves each $96 385 as an exit package ahead of 2017 elections."When the government loots it has no limits but when doctors ask for fair pay the president says he has limits," the union tweeted earlier this week alongside an image of the newspaper headline announcing the bonus.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
