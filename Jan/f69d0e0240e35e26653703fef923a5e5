There is less volume of water being produced at the plant and it is not enough to satisfy the demand," Mbombela Local Municipality spokesperson Joseph Ngala said.&nbsp;This follows a spate of protests recently in Kabokweni over water. On Tuesday, locals blocked roads with burning tyres and debris, obstructing the entrance to the town.Pienaar residents also vented their anger by taking to the streets.&nbsp;"The government will never stop failing and taking us for granted. How do they expect us to live without water? I am using a flushing toilet, it is worse as I have to approach my neighbour when nature calls," said angry resident Vusi Ngwamba.READ: Sanco warns: 3 more months of rain is coming'Matter of urgency'Another local, Sbonelo Makamo, said: "This is really affecting us.
