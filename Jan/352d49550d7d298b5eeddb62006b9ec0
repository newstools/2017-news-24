So nothing will happen there," Ndiaye said. "The situation is under control."He added that since the Kanilai residence is private, "There shouldn't be any military there. In the coming days, there will be no more military there."He also said that General Bora Colley, the head of a Gambian military commando unit, had been arrested in Senegal, without giving further details.Four guards of Jammeh's wife, Zainab, were also arrested, in the border town of Karang in Senegal, and were being held in Dakar. Ndiaye said that Gambian officers and soldiers needed to be "screened", including "background checks, so that we know all of them", he said.He added, however, that the Gambian armed forces have been "very co-operative, and we are now controlling the ammunitions and the weapons. So there is no need for us to stay longer. That's why we are downsising gradually."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
