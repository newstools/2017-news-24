Makenga is the subject of US sanctions, including a travel ban and assets freeze for "serious violations of international law involving the targeting of women and children" in armed conflict.The news of missing M23 fighters is likely to alarm DRC's government, which has repeatedly urged Uganda's government to hold the rebels.M23 launched its rebellion in eastern DRC in April 2012, becoming the latest reincarnation of a Tutsi rebel group dissatisfied with DRC's government, until it was repulsed by UN forces and DRC's army. Many rebels fled to Rwanda and Uganda before a 2013 peace agreement.At the time, Ugandan officials said about 1 700 M23 rebels had fled to Uganda, which was mediating talks between the rebels and DRC's government. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
