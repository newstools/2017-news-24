Human rights defenders, civil society activists, journalists, and government opponents, were harassed, threatened or faced arbitrary arrest by police. Widespread impunity continues for abuses by police and state security agents," said the report.The president, the report said, publicly attacked judges for "reckless" rulings that allowed public protests against his rule, "further eroding judicial independence".&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
