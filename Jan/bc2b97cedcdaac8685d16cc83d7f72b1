In a response to questions from HRW, Burundi communication official Nancy-Ninette Mutoni said the ruling party had received no complaints of abuses.However, she said the Imbonerakure "not only have the right but also the obligation to do surveillance and to signal all movements and suspect acts to the security forces."Nkurunziza, 53, has worked to shore up control of the country with a crackdown on opponents, the media and civil society.Burundi has also moved to quit the International Criminal Court which was investigating the country, and cut ties with the UN's main human rights body after a damning September report detailed atrocities and warned of "genocide".The European Union and United States have slapped sanctions on a handful of high-ranking individuals in Burundi's government, and the EU has also suspended aid to the country.HRW called for more targeted sanctions, and for the international community to probe abuses by the Imbonerakure.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
