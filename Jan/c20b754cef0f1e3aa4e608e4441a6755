There are 10 provinces in Zimbabwe.Last year youths were reportedly told to raise $30 000 from each province though some had difficulty meeting the target, according to a piece in the privately-owned Newsday in February.Elias Sibanda, a ruling party youth official told the Chronicle on Monday: "A committee has been formed to fund-raise for the occasion... our target is 25 000 that should go to the national office."&nbsp;Fund-raising dinner&nbsp;No explanation was given for the reduced target. But Zimbabwe's current cash squeeze that sees the payment of civil servants' salaries regularly delayed could be a factor.Government teachers have previously complained that they have been forced to contribute to the holding of the party.Of course, the $250 000 fund-raising target doesn't mean that that will necessarily be the total cost of Mugabe's birthday. Last year's party reportedly cost at least $800 000.There will almost certainly be other sources of cash, food and cakes to make the party a success. There was outrage from many outside Zimbabwe at Mugabe's 91st birthday party, when a landowner donated an elephant (and other game) to feed party-goers. A fund-raising dinner was held last year, while diamond firms were also told to contribute.&nbsp;Mugabe, who's currently on holiday, turns 93 on February 21.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
