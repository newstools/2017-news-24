Taylaann.Holtz I THINK it would be in the national interest if Judge Nkola Motata resigned without any delay. The man allegedly caused his car to crash into a wall in 2007 in a drunken stupor and added insult to injury by making racist rants and uttering profanities at the time of the incident. Unbelievably, he has had an extended fully paid holiday for almost a decade and has cost the hard-pressed taxpayers approximately R16 million in salaries and benefits that he “earned” by his notorious actions and deliberate delaying tactics. Judge Dhaya Pillay is to be commended for recently rejecting Motata’s pathetic attempts to have the Judicial Services Tribunal to inquire into his misdemeanors thwarted and also ruling that the errant judge should bear the costs of the legal action as a punitive measure. One is innocent until proven guilty. Nevertheless, this is certainly one judge whose shameful actions, non-repentance, failure to take responsibility for his misdoings and Fabian tactics must never be emulated. Simon T.
