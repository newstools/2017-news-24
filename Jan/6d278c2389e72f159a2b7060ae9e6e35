Belhaj claims British involvement in his illegal rendition.Files unearthed from Gaddafi's archives after his fall suggest he was captured due to a British tip-off.Belhaj's case is against Jack Straw, who was Britain's foreign minister in 2004, and Mark Allen, who was a senior MI6 counter-terrorism officer at the time, according to lawyers in the case.Sapna Malik from the law firm Leigh Day said: "We hope that the defendants in this action now see fit to apologise to our clients and acknowledge the wrongs done so that they may turn the page on this wretched chapter of their lives and move on".Straw responded to the ruling in a statement saying: "As foreign secretary I acted at all times in a manner which was fully consistent with my legal duties, and with national and international law."I was never in any complicit in the unlawful rendition or detention of anyone by other states," Straw said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
