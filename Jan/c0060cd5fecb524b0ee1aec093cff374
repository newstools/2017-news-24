The north African country has been mired in chaos since the 2011 downfall of longtime dictator Moammar Gaddafi. Chad is seen as a key ally of the West in its fight against jihadists in Africa. President Idriss Deby Itno is supported by France and the United States, who need the cooperation of the Chadian military in the region.The country is part of the regional alliance fighting Boko Haram Islamists who have spread their insurgency from northern Nigeria to the border regions of neighbouring Chad, Niger and Cameroon.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
