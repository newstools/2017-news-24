Sharks were spotted in the area at 12:30, Smith said. In another incident, a boy went missing, prompting a portion of the beach to be evacuated so lifeguards could look for the youngster. The boy was later found. Smith said that Strand Beach was extremely crowded, with roughly 40 000 to 50 000 people there. According to Craig Lambinon from the National Sea Rescue Institute, by Sunday at 14:00 there had been no confirmed drownings in Cape Town. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
