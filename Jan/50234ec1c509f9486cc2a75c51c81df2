However, at this time in 2016, the system was at 61.9%.The Vaal Dam itself had increased by 3.1% over the last two weeks and its levels now stood at 44.4% capacity.The Sterkfontein Dam was maintaining a steady level of 86%, while Grootdraai Dam was filled to 90.9% of its capacity.The water levels of the Katse Dam in Lesotho had, meanwhile, dropped to 38.7%.Other area experiencing water levels of below 50% in certain dams included the Free State, KwaZulu-Natal and the City of Cape Town."Limpopo [is] just tipping over the 50% mark, with 50.8%," Ratau said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
