The party had already agreed to hold one, but wanted to lump it together with its policy conference in June.The senior members, however, want the two to be held separately."It&rsquo;s critically important that we also look at the electoral process internal to the ANC. You can&rsquo;t limit it to the considerations of the ANC and how it is led," Mufamadi said.The party needed to review whether its current systems prevented it from remaining true to its principles of good governance and responsiveness to society.Another stalwart, Murphy Morobe, said they had set short, medium and long-term goals. Short-term goals included encouraging ANC members to discuss how the party had reached its present state.The other two goals related to the party&rsquo;s elective conference in December this year, and the national elections in 2019.The leadership elected at the conference needed to take the ANC onto a different trajectory, Morobe said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
