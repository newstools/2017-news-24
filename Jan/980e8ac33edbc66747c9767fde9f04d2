These groups are engaged in mercenary activities and, allegedly, in criminal activities in those countries," it added.This leaves only one other group controlling some territory in Darfur: the Sudanese Liberation Army (SLA/AW) led by Abdul Wahid al-Nour, who has been living in exile in France.The JEM and SLA/MM have adopted a "waiting strategy," working to rebuild their fighting forces in Libya and South Sudan until there are "new opportunities to re-engage in Darfur with strengthened military capabilities," said the report.The UN Security Council is due to discuss peace efforts in Darfur on Friday. Last week, the council met behind closed doors to hear a report from former South African president Thabo Mbeki, who traveled to Khartoum for talks last month as the African Union's peace envoy.The council wants all rebel groups to join the Darfur peace process.At least 300 000 people have been killed and 2.5 million displaced in Darfur since the conflict erupted in 2003, the UN says.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
