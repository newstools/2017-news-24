Its restive east remains a battleground for rival ethnic militias.Kabila, 45, has been in power since the 2001 assassination of his father Laurent at the height of the Second Congo War.He was confirmed as leader in 2006 during the first free elections since independence from Belgium in 1960, and re-elected for a second term in 2011 in a vote marred by fraud allegations.Compromises Sixteen representatives met on Saturday, comprising eight from the opposition coalition, called Rassemblement ("Gathering"), and eight from the government and groups which had signed a deal with the regime in October.According to a working document for the deal previously seen by AFP, Kabila gave an undertaking that he would not seek a third mandate.In return, the opposition accepted the president would remain in office until handing over to an elected successor. It had previously demanded his immediate departure from public life.In another gain for the opposition which had feared Kabila would seize the interim period to shore up his position, the signatories agreed "no attempt to revise the constitution will be undertaken" during the transition.In a nationwide TV address after the deal, Kabila said "the electoral process must be pursued tirelessly."The bishops also promised to seek a solution for political prisoners, especially Moise Katumbi, a wealthy businessman and potential presidential candidate the opposition want to be allowed to return to the country.Katumbi has been sentenced to a three-year term in prison in an alleged case of property fraud and faces another trial in an alleged case of mercenary recruitment.Voters were originally to have chosen a new president in 2016.But the authorities said the electoral register had to be overhauled - a huge enterprise in a country almost the size of Europe.And in a highly controversial ruling, the constitutional court had said Kabila could remain in office until an election was held.The ruling fed opposition fears that he planned to amend the constitution to allow him to run for a third term.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
