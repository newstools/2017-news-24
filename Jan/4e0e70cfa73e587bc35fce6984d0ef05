The court, short of judges, has said it might not be able to consider that challenge until May, and Jammeh says Gambia should await its decision.Jammeh might be wary of a Nigerian promise of safe haven. Nigeria offered asylum to Liberian warlord Charles Taylor in 2003 to help end the civil war he started in 1989, but was forced by international pressure to hand Taylor over in 2006 for trial for war crimes committed in Sierra Leone. Taylor was convicted in 2013 and is serving a 50-year sentence in a British prison.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
