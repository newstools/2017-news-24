Sometimes he has to lean against the wall for support because his balance was somewhat affected, but it makes him even more adorable," Abrahams says.Tara McGovern from the SPCA said they would make sure Phoenix and his new owner were a good match."The new owner has to know pit bulls and has to love dogs. If the potential owner has other dogs, we&rsquo;d have to first make sure they get along with Phoenix," she says.She said, even though Phoenix was healthy, any potential new owner would have to keep in mind that he needed some extra attention. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
