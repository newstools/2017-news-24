Another two were handed over during a ceremony at the Bizerte naval base in the north of the country, attended by the US ambassador and senior officials.The remaining two boats are expected to be delivered within a year.Ambassador Daniel Rubinstein said in addition to the patrol boats "starting this summer 13 radar stations along the Tunisia coast will be equipped with new coastal radars" to bolster the navy.The boats and radar stations, as well as joint naval exercises later this year "represent a clear picture of the strong US commitment" to Tunisia as it battles extremism and tackles the "unprecedented migrant flows across the Mediterranean", said Rubinstein.He added that the US would assist Tunisia with installing a border security system along its frontier with Libya.Tunisia has built a 200km barrier that stretches about half the length of the border in an attempt to prevent militants from infiltrating.In 2015, the United States designated Tunisia a major non-NATO ally, a status that allows for reinforced military cooperation.And in May last year it delivered military hardware, including light aircraft, jeeps and communications systems as part of a $20m package to bolster its military capabilities.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
