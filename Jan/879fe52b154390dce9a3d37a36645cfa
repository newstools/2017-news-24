It is unfortunate that this investigation is being conducted through the media, characterised by the distortion of facts, disinformation and malice, including an insult on the integrity of the acting national commissioner and his family," the police statement said."The parading of the media at the acting national commissioner's house, while he was being interviewed and served with the search warrant, and the level of disrespect and lack of courtesy by all involved has been noted by him with disgust and disappointment."The "media circus" at his home traumatised his family, police said."It is against this background that the entire investigation is considered an assault on the character and integrity of the acting national commissioner aimed at irreparably damaging his reputation and taking his focus away from the execution of his duties. The acting national commissioner has briefed his lawyers to take this matter forward," the statement said.Phahlane said IPID had committed to providing him with questions which he would respond to in writing. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
