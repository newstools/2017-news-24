If his conviction is upheld, Habre will serve his sentence in Senegal or in another AU country.The May decision brought closure for relatives of up to 40 000 people killed and many more kidnapped, raped or tortured during Habre's time as president. Habre fled to Senegal after his 1990 ouster by Chad's current President Idriss Deby, and for more than 20 years lived freely in an upmarket Dakar suburb with his wife and children.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
