MSF's Jochum said civilians were paying the price of a "merciless conflict" between government forces and Boko Haram, which has allied itself to the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.At least 20 000 have been killed and more than 2.6 million made homeless since Boko Haram's insurgency began in 2009.International aid agencies have condemned the bombing of civilians, who are facing extreme food shortages because of the conflict, as well as having lost their livelihoods and families.One aid worker, who asked not to be identified, described the incident as "horrifying" and "a huge setback to humanitarian work in the northeast".Rann only recently became accessible to aid agencies because of improved security but Thursday night's attack underlined the fragile peace in the remote region.One member of the civilian vigilantes in Rann told AFP a convoy of Boko Haram fighters on four pick-up trucks and several motorbikes "invaded the town", firing heavy weapons."We surprised them because they thought there wasn't enough security following the accident in the camp (on Tuesday)," he said on condition of anonymity."They met stiff resistance from security forces and vigilantes. Fifteen (Boko Haram fighters) were killed, a pick-up truck was impounded and some of them were arrested."A police source in nearby Gamboru-Ngala gave a similar account but said 14 Islamists were killed. Both said Boko Haram had moved into the area after their ouster from the Sambisa Forest.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
