So we are investigating," Smith said."Information has been forthcoming from two or three witnesses who observed things that they have communicated."READ: I&rsquo;ve lost my whole life - owner of luxury lodge destroyed by Western Cape firesUrban edges not maintainedMeanwhile, the city&rsquo;s fire department head criticised farm owners, saying that urban edges were not maintained properly, which made it easier for fires to spread."[Poorly maintained urban edges] would be conducive [for] fire [to] spread more easily, so farm owners need to take responsibility for the land," Ian Schnetler said."If they really want to protect the land, they are required to maintain their land properly and, in terms of some of the areas we&rsquo;ve been to, the land is not maintained properly," he said.According to Smith, poorly maintained urban edges complicated firefighting efforts."It&rsquo;s a mixed bag. Some owners are very conscientious and, through the fire protection associations, have done good work. Others have been less proactive and that has complicated the firefighting efforts," Smith said.PICS: Fire ravages Somerset WestDamagesSchnetler said that fires were still burning, but in areas that were inaccessible."[It] is burning high up in the peaks of the mountain on top of the Blue Gum forest, inaccessible to ground crews and inaccessible to flying aircraft at the moment because of the wind situation," he said.Schentler confirmed that a saw mill had burnt down on the Lourensford wine farm on Friday.According to Smith, the damage caused by the fires was currently at R54m."R54m now, if you include the saw mills at Lourensford. All said and done, we will rest probably somewhere at about R60m in damages and 10 hectares affected," Smith said.He said the fires were the worst the city has seen in the past few years."The fires are way more severe than the fires in the Southern Peninsula a few years ago. These fires burnt down several more buildings and damaged a bigger area," he said.&nbsp; &nbsp;Tougher legislationAccording to Van Rooyen, legislation should be used to discourage people from starting fires."We [must] introduce extra punitive measures to... discourage such practices," he said.Van Rooyen said he would work together with the justice minister in creating legislation, but could not confirm when this would be finalised."We really need to work together with the justice cluster in confirming the severity of the matters that are being employed, to deal with those who start these fires, because we are losing a lot of money in this exercise," Van Rooyen said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
