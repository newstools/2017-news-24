We find it very hard to work under these circumstances," she said.Last year, staff closed the offices and staged a protest at the gates to demand the department take action.The staff member said the water cans sent to the department were not enough to serve everyone."This is so embarrassing," she said. "We have to leave our clients behind while we are busy searching for a place to have access to a bathroom."I love my job so much, but when thinking of this water issue I just get sick when thinking of going to work," she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
