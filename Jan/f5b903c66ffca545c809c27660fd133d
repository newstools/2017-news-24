I would never harm animals." &nbsp;Investigation to be launchedAccording to Barnard, she was approached by the local environment and economic development offices for a permit to get rid of the tree because it&nbsp;posed a health risk."I didn't even know when they were planning to do so. I was just as surprised as everyone else when they pitched up."According to Sithole, it is unclear why the permit was issued, because breeding season for herons starts in early December and the chicks would only be able to fly at the end of March."As soon as the chicks can fly, they leave the tree. I don't know why they couldn't have waited before cutting down the tree."Executive Mayor Elza van Lingen said a permit to remove a protected tree or animal could only be issued by the Department of Environmental Affairs."An internal investigation will have to be done to determine who was responsible for issuing the permit," she said.Meanwhile, around 150 rescued chicks have been taken to the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (Sanccob) at St Francis Bay and African Dawn.Percy Hickman, the owner of African Dawn, a bird and animal rehabilitation centre, said the chicks would have to be looked after for the next month to six weeks, after which they were expected to be strong enough to be released.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
