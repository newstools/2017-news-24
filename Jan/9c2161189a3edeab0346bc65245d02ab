Turkey, which calls it the Fethullah Terror Organisation (FETO), has embarked on a massive crackdown of the group.Since the coup, Turkey has piled pressure on the United States to extradite Gulen, a one-time Erdogan ally.In August, an official Turkish delegation visited Morocco to convince the authorities of the danger of Gulen's group.A school director from the Mohamed Al-Fatih group at the time rejected any link with Gulen for seven schools teaching 2 500 students including 2 470 Moroccans.He said 90% of their teachers were also Moroccan nationals.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
