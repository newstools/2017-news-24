"We stand together, recognising that defending the most marginalised among us, is defending all of us." #WomenMarch to fight ugly words with kind deeds &amp; raising awareness at #SisterMarchCT #CapeTown pic.twitter.com/zcKngD32Ee&mdash; Noel Crowie (@crowieN) January 21, 2017We've arrived outside parliament. #SisterMarchCT #WomensMarch @womensmarch #CapeTown pic.twitter.com/t3qOSTQLcp&mdash; Women's March CPT (@WomensMarchRSA) January 21, 2017Unforgettable experience ?
