These included Ngubane's assertion that The New Age breakfast shows did not cost the SABC a cent, while former employee Vuyo Mvoko had testified that Morning Live resources were diverted and that up to R500 000 was spent.Committee to verify testimonies"There are at least four incidents where there were direct contradictions for the first time.
