Abbasi told AFP on Tuesday that the incident was now "over", but that it poses a question on the implementation of laws protecting women from such sexual harassment."Their implementation is still a dream," Abbasi said."Even us, the parliamentarians are not safe from gender biases and harassment," she said.Pakistani women have spent decades fighting for their rights in a deeply conservative country where so-called honour killings and acid attacks remain commonplace.Pakistan has passed several laws to increase protections available to women in recent years, some at the provincial level, but critics have warned that without proper enforcement they will have little impact. Last year a bill passed in Punjab province redefined "violence" to include "any offense committed against a women", prompting an Islamic religious body to protest that men should be allowed to "lightly beat" their wives. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
