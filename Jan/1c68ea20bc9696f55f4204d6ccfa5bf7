It started on Monday.&nbsp;"The square will look completely different, with trees, including jacarandas, better lawns and benches which will suit the modern landscaping. It will make it more pleasing on the eye and contribute towards the revitalisation of the CBD."Mashigo said that, until the project was completed, some streets would have to be closed to motorists and pedestrians.There would no longer be parking bays on the square and a part of Paul Kruger Street would be closed to motorists after the project was completed.&nbsp;"The road will then only be used by A Re Yeng, the city's rapid bus service, and emergency services vehicles," Mashigo said.Motorists would have to find parking around the square. Some parking would be available on surrounding streets, including Mutual and Parliament streets. Only businesses with parkades in Mutual, Parliament and Palace streets, as well as Bank Avenue, would have access. &nbsp;As of mid-October no vehicles would be allowed on Church Square or the adjacent Mutual, Parliament and Palace streets and Bank Avenue.&nbsp;People have been advised to use alternative routes while the work to transform the square is in progress.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
