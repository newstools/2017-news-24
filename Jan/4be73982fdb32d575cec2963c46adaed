A few indicators point to weak leadership, lack of accountability - especially in schools and districts - non-completion of curriculum, lack of quality common assessments throughout the system, curriculum changes, and lack of resources."The most important one amongst these is the leadership that failed to take decisions and to act decisively."He said the province had achieved a pass rate of 66.4% in 2016 and had come seventh nationally, with the Free State claiming the first position.'Shocked, ashamed and embarrassed'Dlungwana said the 2014/15 academic results had left the province "shocked, ashamed and embarrassed, but still willing to reflect and turn the situation around".KwaZulu-Natal has seen three serious declines since 2006.Between 2006 and 2008 the pass rate dropped by 8%.It dropped a further 3% between 2010 and 2011.The biggest drop was 16.7% experienced between 2013 and 2015."In 2013, we received 77.4%, in 2014 we received 69.7% and in 2015, 60.7%."He said KwaZulu-Natal, being the second largest province, was faced with tough challenges."We acknowledge that, as one of the most rural provinces, we are confronted with unemployment, poverty and inequality, and this places a burden on our schooling system."Welcoming guests, eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede, said 2017 was a year for celebrating and encouraging unity.Gumede said the ANC&rsquo;s Oliver Tambo, one of the organisation's brightest minds, would have turned 100 this year."The ANC has always encouraged Africans to study.
