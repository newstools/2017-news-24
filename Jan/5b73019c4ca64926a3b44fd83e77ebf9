The agreement, attached to the court papers, is on an ANC letterhead.Part of her job was to increase a positive narrative around the ruling party in the lead-up to the elections.READ: Now ANC admits to 'off-books' election campaignCopyright infringementsThe ANC planned to spend R50m on the covert campaign, according to papers Bolani filed in the High Court in Johannesburg.According to an amaBhungane report published on News24, this included a seemingly independent news site and a chat show, using "influencers" on social media, and planning to print fake opposition party posters."It is quite clear that what is going on here is an abuse of a free democratic system," said Selfe."We certainly intend to take the matter up with the IEC [Electoral Commission of SA] in the most emphatic way since it is completely against the spirit of democratic elections."He said if the allegations were true, the ANC had violated the Municipal Electoral Act.On a civil front, he said lawyers would look at the potential of copyright infringements and abuse of corporate identity.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
