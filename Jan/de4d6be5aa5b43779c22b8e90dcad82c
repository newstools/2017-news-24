An aid worker involved in the evacuation of the body gave a similar estimate of the bomber's age."The girl was clearly not more than 10 and this could have made her too nervous, making her to detonate the explosives prematurely," the aid worker suggested.Borno state police spokesman Victor Isuku, meanwhile, said a second female suicide bomber was caught and lynched by an angry mob. Her bomb was safely detonated by security forces, he said.In December two girls aged between seven and eight detonated explosives in suicide attacks on market in the city, injuring 19 people.Authorities blamed the attack on Boko Haram, whose seven-year insurgency has killed 20 000 people and displaced 2.6 million others. The conflict has spilled into Nigeria's northern neighbours.Saturday's attack came a week after Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said the jihadist group had been routed from Sambisa forest, its last stronghold in Borno state. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
