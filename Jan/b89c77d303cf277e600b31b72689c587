The deficit is forecast to hit 10.1 percent of GDP by the end of the fiscal year, Garhy said, but to fall to around 8.5 percent in the next fiscal year and then "to gradually drop".Government revenues were up to 220 billion Egyptian pounds ($11.7bn) in the first half of the fiscal year, from 192 billion pounds in the same period last year. Spending meanwhile rose 10 percent to 389 billion pounds from June, he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
