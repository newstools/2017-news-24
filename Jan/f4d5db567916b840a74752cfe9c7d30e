No staff (are) allowed to speak in the studio," the staff member added.The two other stations affected remained off air by Tuesday afternoon.Although the NIA operatives offered no reason for the closure, the Afri radio source said one anchor had announced on air that President-elect Adama Barrow would be inaugurated on January 19.The NIA reports directly to President Yahya Jammeh, who has ruled The Gambia with an iron fist for the last 22 years and has declared the result of the election in which opponent Barrow was declared the winner to be void.Jammeh is currently challenging the election result in court, with the case due to be heard on January 10.The 2016 Reporters Without Borders World Press Freedom Index ranked The Gambia 145th out of 180 countries, pointing to "a climate of terror around anything remotely to do with journalism".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
