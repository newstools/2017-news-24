The ADF has not claimed any of the Beni massacres. Experts on DRC have not found any link between the group and the global jihadist underground.Others have alleged that government agents have had a role in the killing - claims Kinshasa rejects.A report by experts in March said members of the Congolese army, former rebels from the RCD-K/ML group - who held the area during the 1998-2003 Second DRC War - and local militias were all involved in the mass killings.In explaining the violence, some experts have cited struggles for control of trafficking in various industries like timber, agricultural produce or minerals in a region with extremely rich potential.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
