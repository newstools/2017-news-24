"No one is untouchable any longer in our country," it said.News of Ngambia's incarceration came on the heels of this week's sacking of Oil Minister Etienne Dieudonne Ngoubou, who left his office on Tuesday to a chorus of boos from ministry staff.Press reports said he was interrogated on Wednesday as part of an inquiry into the management of funds linked to the oil industry.Another leading figure in the oil industry was detained early this week, the press said, and several post office managers too have been detained.The anti-corruption drive comes as Gabon prepares to host football's 2017 Africa Cup of Nations on Saturday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
