However, in November 2016 his appeal was unsuccessful and he was accordingly ordered through his attorney to report to a correctional facility," he said."Du Preez failed to adhere to the order, a warrant of arrest was issued and he was sought, culminating in his capture on Friday by the elite unit."Ramovha said it was further alleged that, while awaiting the appeal decision, Du Preez reportedly "went on coaxing R5 donations from his Facebook followers and locals", ostensibly to pay a needy client&rsquo;s legal fees."[He further apparently stated] that this was in exchange of the free legal advice he had given to the locals over the years. This separate matter is however still being probed."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
