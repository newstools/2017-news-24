When it lapses, the parole board will determine if he is fit for parole. We can't confirm if he will be released yet until the board makes a decision... An outcome has to be made before the expiry date, which is this month," Nxumalo said.&nbsp; In February 2016, the High Court in Johannesburg ruled against Motsamai's application for an unconditional release.&nbsp;Motsamai previously reportedly refused to be released on parole, stating that the conditions were unfair. He lodged an urgent application to force the Department of Correctional Services to release him unconditionally.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
