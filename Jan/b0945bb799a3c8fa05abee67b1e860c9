several hours earlier in the morning to fetch water to bath before going
to school. "Our
government is useless. We have been complaining about water but no one is
willing to help us. Pupils have to wake up at around 03:00 in the morning and
walk distances to neighbouring communities to get water," said an angry
Nomcebo Zulu. "They
have to walk for 15 to 30 minutes to get water so they can get cleaned up for
school," she said. Zulu
said she not only blames the government for this
but also locals who interfere with the infrastructure. "Locals
contribute to this matter as there are many illegal pipe connections and other
pipes were cut off." A Grade
4 pupil said: "What can we say? We want to be clean and teachers chase us
from class if we are dirty or smelly." Joseph
Ngala, spokesperson for the Mbombela
Local Municipality, had little to offer in the way of hope and said the recent
rains had made matters worse. "I
know that water situation is not only particular to the community mentioned but the larger community of Nsikazi
south due to recent heavy rains. We are still trying to get [solutions] on how
the issue can be resolved." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
