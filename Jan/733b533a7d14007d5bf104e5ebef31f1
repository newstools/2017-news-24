The casualties will be the poor and working class students, whilst students from the middle and upper class families will opt for private provision or studying abroad."He said academics would also move abroad or to more stable and better paying jobs in the private sector.The department was already getting reports, Nzimande said, that institutions were losing academics.He emphasised the need to continue to engage with stakeholders to promote stability."This means that those student leaders and organisations genuinely concerned about access and affordability should maintain high levels of vigilance, as there are opportunists in their midst, ready to hijack their noble cause."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
