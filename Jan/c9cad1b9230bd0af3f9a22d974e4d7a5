His resignation letter is dated 20th January. He is out of the country. He has gone back to Nigeria," judicial secretary Landing Sanneh told AFP.Emmanuel Fagbanle had deferred a decision on hearing Jammeh's legal complaint over a lack of other judges to hear the case, but was known to be uneasy with the mercurial strongman's use of the court system to pursue his personal grievances.Jammeh's defiance over the election result prompted more than 76 000 people to seek shelter in Senegal, the UN refugee agency said on Tuesday, citing Senegalese authorities. The agency said "more than an estimated 8 000 people, as of Monday, have returned to their native Gambia since the political crisis there ended" when Jammeh left the country on Saturday night. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
