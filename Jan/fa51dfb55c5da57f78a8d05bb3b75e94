While Malema singled out Zanu-PF as cowards for failing to be honest with the old man, it is necessary to exercise self-audit as citizens of Zimbabwe and ask ourselves if we have been honest enough to both, Mugabe and Zanu-PF."Ndlovu said Zanu PF officials were not only cowards, but were also not fit to replace Mugabe, the report said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
