Luak fled to Kenya in August 2013 after receiving death threats for defending a high-ranking politician accused of treason, and has publicly criticised human rights abuses and corruption by South Sudanese government officials.Human Rights Watch said he had been brutally attacked at his Nairobi home in October 2015, and was recognised as a refugee under Kenyan law.HRW noted that in recent years Kenya had "unlawfully deported several prominent opposition members from neighbouring countries to their countries of origin, despite being recognised as refugees under Kenyan law."Amnesty International's South Sudan researcher Elizabeth Deng warned Thursday that the two men risked "arbitrary detention and ill treatment and torture" if they were sent back to their country.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
