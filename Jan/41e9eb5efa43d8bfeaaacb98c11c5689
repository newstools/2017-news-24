It should be like anywhere in Dubai, anywhere in very developed countries in the world," he said.But he told an umbrella body for youths in the southern Niger delta region, the Ijaw Youth Council, it had a leadership role to play."That leadership role comes with tremendous responsibility. The first responsibility is ensuring peace. You can't thrive without peace."Before Osinbajo's visit, the Ijaw Youth Council called for the release of militants. It has previously dismissed government claims it is in talks to end the unrest.Oil revenue is central to Nigeria's economy, accounting for some 70% of government earnings and 90% of foreign exchange.Over-reliance on crude export sales has been seen as a key factor in Nigeria's economic troubles alongside rampant corruption and mismanagement.Osinbajo warned that oil "will not be as precious as it is today" and Asian countries currently buying Nigerian crude were fast developing alternative sources of energy."We have a window of opportunity, maybe 20 to 30 years. If we don't take that window of opportunity... we will be the worse for it," he added.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
