According to a report from Traffic Services spokesperson, Maxine Bezuidenhout, the collision occurred near the Jip de Jager off-ramp and the woman died as a result of her injuries. Asked whether the the incident is linked to lane closures and speed restrictions currently in place along the N1, Bezuidenhout says at this stage it is too early to tell. On Friday, the contractor responsible for the roadworks released plans for lane closures and speed restrictions from Monday 30 January to Saturday 4 February. According to Byron la Hoe, spokesperson for the provincial transport department, this forms part of the department&rsquo;s project to extend the third lane on the N1 from west of Durban Road to beyond the Old Oak Interchange. According to an alert issued by the contractor, a general speed restriction of 60km&nbsp; will be applicable for the duration of the road works. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
