Salafist sheikh Hassan Kettani wrote on Facebook."If true it would be a disaster," he added.DiscriminationHammad Kabbaj, a preacher who was barred from standing in parliamentary elections in October over his alleged ties to "extremism", denounced the ban as "unacceptable".In comments on Facebook, he mocked the "Morocco of freedom and human rights" which "considers the wearing of the Western swimsuit on the beaches an untouchable right".Oussama Boutaher, a coordinator that defends Islamist prisoners, said the burqa ban amounted to "discrimination"."This shows that we are considered second-class citizens. It attacks individual freedoms even though Morocco has signed a number of international protocols on human rights," he told AFP. "Our example isn't Afghanistan, but the prophet and his followers," added Boutaher, who also rubbished the idea that curbing the sale of the burqa would improve security.But lawmaker Nouzha Skalli, a former family and social development minister, welcomed the ban as "an important step in the fight against religious extremism".The High Council of Oulemas, the country's top religious authority, has yet to comment on the issue of banning full-face veils. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
