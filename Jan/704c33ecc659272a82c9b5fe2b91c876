Why didn't they contact the president's office?"Van Damme said Maimane's office was in touch with the South African embassy's office in Ramallah and the office of the Palestinian Authority's president. She repeated that the proposed meeting with Abbas was confirmed, but then cancelled."We're happy to appraise the Palestinian embassy with facts. They are welcome to contact the leader's office because they are clearly ill-informed."Last week, Maimane met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Nethanyau during his visit, and said he had requested to meet Abbas as well.He instead met with Palestinian officials after the meeting with Abbas was cancelled due to a scheduling conflict.*Note: A previous version of this story reported&nbsp;photographic evidence had emerged&nbsp;of Maimane and the DA delegation meeting Palestinian Authority officials.
