Supporters of Mugabe threatened to dig up his remains last year in solidarity with the #RhodesMustFall student movement in South Africa. It's unlikely Mugabe's party would be held at the burial site: there are large expanses of flat grassland nearer to the main entrances.Last year the celebrations were held at the Great Zimbabwe Monument in Masvingo, a Unesco World Heritage site. The ruins, which date back to between the 11th and 15th centuries, are of deep historic significance to Zimbabweans.There's no word yet on how much the festivities will cost, although last year the bill was said to be around $1 million. Zimbabwe is in the grips of a worsening cash squeeze, with the payment of civil servants' salaries regularly delayed. The central bank recently introduced "bond notes", a form of paper money that has no value outside the country.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
