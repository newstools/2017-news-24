Regional secretary Silumko Khethokuhle Mabona told News24 it was a &ldquo;bogus&rdquo; statement that clearly formed part of the ANC&rsquo;s &ldquo;war room&rdquo;. &ldquo;The nation is fully aware of the failed R50m project by the ANC and it is clear that there are some few millions left to spend on reckless press statement in discrediting the EFF,&rdquo; he added in an official statement. &ldquo;This is some desperate attempt made by the ANC to divert attention away from their mishaps of their failed covert project.&rdquo; He said the region was fully behind Malema. African National Congress secretary general Gwede Mantashe said on Wednesday that there was no such thing as &ldquo;black ops&rdquo; in the ANC. He was referring to an alleged covert R50m ANC operation to undermine the EFF and Democratic Alliance&rsquo;s campaigns ahead of local government elections in 2016. Mantashe said he had no knowledge of the deal.&nbsp; The first statement purporting to be from the EFF in Johannesburg had included Mabona&rsquo;s contact details. It claimed the region would mobilise branches not to support &ldquo;pro-capitalist&rdquo; Malema anymore.&nbsp; It quoted Mabona as saying Malema&rsquo;s &ldquo;flip-flopping&rdquo; and contradiction on important issues had made the party the laughing stock in South African politics. &ldquo;We have totally lost faith in our "Commander in chief". When we turn to look at the history of our CIC, we have realised that most of the time, he says things of which he later regrets about ever saying them,&rdquo; the first statement read. Mabona&rsquo;s reaction was that the statement was &ldquo;very pretentious and false&rdquo;. It was sent while the region was holding a meeting with branches from Soweto. &ldquo;The ANC must focus on its crumbling organisation and accept that they will be out of political power in Gauteng Province come the National General Elections in 2019.&rdquo; The region said Malema remained the only true leader of the economic emancipation movement in the country. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
