President Umaru Yar'Adua died in 2010 from a long-standing, but undisclosed, kidney condition.Before Yar'Adua, the military ruler Sani Abacha died in 1998, officially from a heart attack, but rumours of a more lurid cause of death persist.Buhari himself has had to respond to claims about his health: during the 2015 election campaign that brought him to power, his opponents claimed he was "mortally ill" from prostate cancer.He dismissed the allegations and said a purported medical document used to back up the claim was a forgery.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
