Others, including large herds of cattle, have been doing it as well, Netwerk24 reported.The problem has been aggravated by the drought and heat in the area. December, especially, was a bad month.On Tuesday morning, the four pigs made their way from Frere Street to Cawood Street, and were so full after their final forage in a guest house&rsquo;s garden that they settled in for a snooze under a tree on the sidewalk.DA councillor Rika Featherstonehaugh said they had a major problem with cattle, goats and pigs invading gardens.She said that big herds of cattle &ndash; apparently hundreds of them, and some with herders &ndash; used Cradock&rsquo;s gardens for grazing in December.Several residents who&rsquo;d been away on holiday, arrived home to destroyed gardens &ndash; and a lot of cow dung as proof of the "culprits".Many of the residents, peeved at the garden "invasions", have taken to Facebook to vent their frustration and anger.One told of how he&rsquo;d complained to the health inspector about the foul smell coming from the house where the pigs were being kept, only to be met by a shrug of the shoulders.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
