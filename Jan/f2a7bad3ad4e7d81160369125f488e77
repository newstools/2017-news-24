From what I gather from our people on the ground, students are [protesting] because the college is moving some courses from Alexandra to Ellis Park," National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union national spokesperson Khaya Xaba said.Protesters blocked London Road and 13th Avenue earlier in the day after burning tyres, trees and trash, authorities said.Xaba said the moving of courses to Ellis Park would have dire consequences for students from Alexandra."It means they will have to fork out transport money. We are supporting the community in their protest. We support their view. It is a bad economy and now people will have to find more money."Police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele said the protest had calmed down since the morning."The situation is calm. Protesters and management will be meeting to discuss the issues surrounding the protest. There are no reported injuries or damage to property."The college is a public institution, with campuses around Johannesburg, including Alexandra, Langlaagte, and Parktown. It offers qualifications, including NQF levels two to four, skills courses and learnerships.Protest action in #Alexandra #Joburg #traffic @PigSpotter pic.twitter.com/RlbmvGPYNN&mdash; Thando Tshangela (@tsuai) January 16, 2017Protest action in #Alexandra #Joburg #traffic @PigSpotter pic.twitter.com/RlbmvGPYNNJMPD confirms protest action in #Alexandra, please avoid intersection of Kenning Road and London Road. #Alexprotest pic.twitter.com/hHGDoSgzM2&mdash; iTV Networks SA (@itv_sa) January 16, 2017JMPD confirms protest action in #Alexandra, please avoid intersection of Kenning Road and London Road. #Alexprotest pic.twitter.com/hHGDoSgzM224.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
