Anything more "should be frowned upon".Van Damme and fellow DA MP Mike Waters said the committee needed to be firm. Van Damme suggested that State Security minister David Mahlobo conduct an investigation into his agencies&rsquo; involvement over the years, and report to Parliament.Waters said that the new Inspector General should investigate the alleged involvement of the SSA on behalf of the public.Contradictory testimoniesANC MP Juli Kilian suggested that Parliament and its legal advisers compile a list of all the witnesses who are suspected of giving false testimony to the committee during the hearings.Swart said a further inquiry into those identified witnesses and their testimonies should be held.ANC MP Fezeka Loliwe said evidence of alleged financial misconduct should be referred to Parliament's Scopa committee to investigate.There was also big debate around the testimony of former SABC board chairperson and current Eskom board chairperson Dr Ben Ngubane.The DA asked that the committee consider asking Parliament's public enterprises committee look into the fitness of Ngubane to serve on the board at Eskom.'State capture'EFF MP Fana Mokoena meanwhile tried to sneak in a clause saying the SABC's disintegration is evidence of a larger programme of "state capture" at parastatals.He was shot down by ANC and NFP MPs, who said the events are more akin to "undue influence and pressure".Thus far, MPs have been making individual suggestions which have been recorded in a draft report. The suggestions are not yet binding.The committee will return on Thursday to negotiate its final draft report, with only one stance recorded as the will of the committee with regards to each topic.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
