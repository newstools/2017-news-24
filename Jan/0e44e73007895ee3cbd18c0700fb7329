Many children with disabilities are exposed to high levels of violence and abuse by teachers and students.&rdquo;South Africa&rsquo;s government has failed to implement key aspects of a national policy adopted in 2001, which is meant to provide inclusive education for all children with disabilities.&ldquo;South Africa has not adopted legislation that guarantees the right to inclusive education for children with disabilities.&rdquo;The majority of the government&rsquo;s limited budget for pupils with disabilities is allocated to special, segregated schools rather than to inclusive education, according to the report.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
