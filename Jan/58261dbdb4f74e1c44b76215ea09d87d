"He's not dying, but he has to go for a test in Brussels," the source said.A senior UDPS official expressed greater concern over the health of "the Old Man", as Tshisekedi is affectionately known among his political allies, saying the opposition leader's health had rapidly deteriorated."This could be a one-way trip, we can't rule that out," the party official said on condition of anonymity.The UDPS statement said Tshisekedi would be returning to DRC as soon as possible to "take up his historic responsibilities".Triumphant returnTshisekedi had made a triumphant return in July after two years of medical treatment in former colonial power Belgium, with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets to welcome him home.Kabila, who has been in power since 2001, was due to step down on December 20 at the end of his second and final mandate, but has shown no signs of wanting to leave office.Tshisekedi is supposed to head a transitional body that will be set up until the elections due at the end of the year, with a prime minister to be named from opposition ranks.He had unsuccessfully fought the 2011 presidential election against Kabila, a vote which the opposition alleged was marked by massive fraud.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
