The sandy school grounds are littered with broken glass.School transfersWhile the unsafe area has been cordoned off with a wire fence, teaching is continuing in clean new prefabricated classrooms brought in by the education department as a temporary fix.These accommodate around 200 pupils who refuse to budge.Rubble and discarded animal bones from a butcher lie strewn about on a road leading to the school from a run-down block of flats. Next door is the new Tygersig Primary School, where all the windows and entrances have sturdy mesh over them and two security guards for protection.The education department has said that it has tried to transfer the children to nearby Ravensmead, because of the school's condition.Education MEC Debbie Schafer believes that allowing the teachers and pupils to continue at Uitzig Secondary School would be a violation of their human rights.Dropout riskThe handful of teachers left at the school - where the reception area was in darkness because there was no electricity - did not want to speak for fear of violating department policy.Later, a group of around 150 pupils, parents and their supporters protested at the Western Cape provincial legislature.They demanded that Premier Helen Zille and the education department prioritise fixing the school."The children will have to change their subjects, we will have to buy new school uniforms, the walk is long, and some will definitely drop out," said an angry Chantal Simons."The school is being guarded now by us," said Simons, demanding that Schafer step in and help them."There are five primary schools in the area, and only this high school. Where will the children go to?" asked Simons.She said that even the school feeding scheme had ground to a halt because of the uncertainty, leaving many poor children hungry.Fences stolenSchafer said last week that the guards posted at the school by the department had been targeted by the thieves and vandals who were literally carrying the school off brick by brick.Uitzig community activist Pastor Alex Alexander claimed the department had allowed the school to become a target by failing to maintain it.Department chief director responsible for districts, Clifton Frolick, accepted a memorandum from Grade 12 pupil Chanae Slinger.The memorandum contained the pupils' and parents' demands that the school be fixed.Frolick said the school was not officially closed and that just the unsafe section was cordoned off.The department was trying to find the best option for the school, he said.Frolic said the community alleged the damage was done by gangsters and people with substance abuse problems."But we do not see evidence of a community that wants to protect the school," he said.Asked whether a higher or stronger fence would help, his colleague, deputy director of institutional matters, Tau Matseliso, said: "Three fences have already been stolen."Frolick said the councillors in the area also needed to step up and deal with the rubbish thrown into the streets near the school.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
