The video was taken by the minor and shows her lying in bed alongside a man and a woman who appear to be having sex. The 16-year-old, whose name is known to News24, sticks out her tongue at the camera, and comments that the couple's "session" is "going on forever". "Yes, hello! Your poes!" she says, showing a middle finger to the camera before panning to the two. READ: Video bully says ‘sorry’ The man then swears at the camera, followed by more foul language from the teenager. The woman, who is obscured by the man still on top of her, insists that the teenager stop taking the video. By 16:00 on Tuesday the video had already been shared more than 40 000 times. Most Facebook users commenting on the video found it amusing, while others believed she was in need of psychological help. In October last year a video showing the teenager threatening another girl went viral on social media. In the clip, which is littered with profanity, she threatens to "escort" the girl to her "grave". She later apologised for her behaviour. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
