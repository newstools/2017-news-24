If another eight plants of the kind unveiled on Wednesday were built, there would be no more need for landfill sites.Otterman said Cape Town was perfect for the first plant because of its high landfill prices, a progressive government, and a shortage of gas.The plant would use 500 tons of organic household, municipal, and industrial waste per day, in an anaerobic digestive process, to produce methane, food-grade carbon dioxide, and organic fertilizer.The plant could supply around 4% to 5% of the city's liquid petroleum gas requirement.Clean Energy Africa CEO Marcel Steinberg said there was a noticeable link between economic growth and increased waste. Plants such as theirs provided a &ldquo;zero waste&rdquo; landfill facility because everything produced by the mechanical processes was used.In addition, the people who worked there would not have to pick through waste like those at rubbish dumps. They would have decent working conditions, including unemployment insurance.Afrox was expected to purchase methane and carbon dioxide from the plant. The plant would initially employ 80 people.What got everybody excited was the prospect of fewer landfill sites festering with rubbish as waste would be diverted to the plant and its successors.Zille said the plant would allow Africa to leap-frog centuries of technology to be at the forefront of energy creation. It would contribute to Cape Town's energy stability - an attraction for foreign investors.Western Cape government-funded entity Green Cape had helped with technical support and would work with other municipalities in the province to roll out similar initiatives.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
