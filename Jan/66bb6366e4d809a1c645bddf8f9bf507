"It is my considered opinion and stance that the results of the December 1st election represent a true reflection of the sovereign will of the Gambian people."A statement on state-run television said Bojang had been sacked and replaced with a National Assembly member who was appointed this month as the ruling party's spokesperson.The former journalist said he did not believe a Supreme Court case, due to begin hearings today on an election challenge lodged by Jammeh, had any merit."The current attempts while appearing to have a veneer of constitutionalism are in fact an attempt to subvert the express will of the Gambian electorate," he wrote.The court is unlikely to sit as none of the judges ordered to appear have declared their intention to do so, according to Nigerian and Gambian legal experts. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
