She said the ANC's actions did not make sense to her."It's a reflection of what they represent. [They] keep saying as leaders they need to choose people with the right character, but they keep doing things that are damaging to young women and men, especially young African women," she said.She questioned how the ANC could cause her daughter, a young professional, misery at the same time that it was asking young black professionals to support the 105-year-old movement."You can't contract people and then say you are an NGO, how do they afford to pay for the celebrations of the January 8?"WATCH video below for more:Bolani's mother said the celebrations were still continuing, with gala dinners costing more than R500 000 per table.Amabungane reported earlier on Tuesday that the court had awarded costs in favour of the ANC after the party said that, as a non-government organisation, it relied mainly on membership fees.'You are not here to change the ANC'The ANC issued a defence, claiming that it had no dealings with Bolani. This is despite an affidavit from party general manager Ignatius Jacobs, admitting that Bolani had volunteered to work for the ANC in the lead up to the local government elections.Bolani said, when she became involved in the project, the mandate was to establish positive rhetoric around the ANC and to destabilise the positive growth of opposition parties like the Economic Freedom Fighters and the Democratic Alliance."My initial approach was to first deal with the actual issues within the ANC, [like] being accountable, speaking to the people and being transparent," she saidShe said that when she raised the issues, she was told: "You are not here to change the ANC, just do what you are here to do and leave. The rest is not your business, just take your money and go.""Money that I ironically never got," said Bolani.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
