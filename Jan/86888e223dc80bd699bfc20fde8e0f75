One such school was registered in 2011 under the name Chief Fana Dlamini Secondary School, in Matsulu outside Mbombela.A shortage of schools in the province had led to concerns among residents that there were not enough places for their children.One resident, Sam Mhlongo, questioned why the Chief Fana Dlamini school had not been built yet. He said there were enough plots to accommodate it, and that promises had been made that it would be built this year.&ldquo;What is the department waiting for?&rdquo; he asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;It has been a long time since it was registered. This area has one primary school and learners have to walk over 15km to get to a secondary school in nearby areas,&rdquo; he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
