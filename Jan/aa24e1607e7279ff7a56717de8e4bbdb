These include H5N1, H5N2, H5N5, H5N6, H5N9, H7N1, H7N3, H7N7 et H7N8.Europe is battling the spread of H5N1, culling millions of birds on farms and moving them indoors to avoid contagion from infected wildlife.The strain can be transmitted to humans, and is held responsible for the deaths of several hundred people since 2003.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
