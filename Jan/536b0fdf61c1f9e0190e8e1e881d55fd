	      A 60-YEAR-OLD man was recently arrested by the Durban Explosives Unit for dealing in fireworks using a fake licence.  Unit members were doing a routine patrol in the Pinetown CBD when they saw a shop in Stanfield Lane selling fireworks and went in to check.  Upon checking the licence they discovered it was fake and the owner was immediately arrested and fireworks with a street value of R350 000 were seized from the shop. KZN Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa asked shop owners who sell fireworks to comply with the Explosive Act.  “Those who are found to contravene such Act will face the long arm of the law.” - Supplied.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
