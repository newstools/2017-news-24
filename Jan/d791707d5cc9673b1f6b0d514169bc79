We are an underground record label known as Taliban Records, formed in November 2016. Our first event was the first annual After Christmas Bang , which was the first of its in the community. The purpose of the event was to keep the youth entertained and so that they don t fall prey to drugs and other youth issues, said Taliban Records spokesperson Thamsanqa Nkomo. He said Clermont and KwaDabeka communities are troubled by drug abuse, teenage pregnancy and crime. We are dedicated to addressing these social ills in our community through the power of music, which is a universal language. We encourage the youth to discover and use their talent and turn it into a business, especially if one is gifted in music or anything creative. Our mission is to get more than 100 boys and girls by the end of 2017 to follow their dream and change their mindset and think positively because we believe that the only limits that exist are those set in our mind. - Supplied. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
