He had chatted briefly to the Australian tourist, who he knows only as Nick, and everyone was chilled and subdued."No one was drinking too much because we were going to a party the next day," he added.Nick went to take a selfie at the end of the rim pool and suddenly slipped over the edge of the barrier, Botha explained.As he slipped, he landed on his head and people could not see if he was breathing or not."Because I am a trainer, I know CPR, so I found the lowest balustrade and I jumped."When I got down too, I realised he couldn't breathe because he was choking on his blood."Botha says he stabilised&nbsp;Nick's breathing and did everything he could to make sure he was alright until paramedics arrived, in spite of his own excrutiating pain.Since then, he has been flooded with messages of appreciation and was hoping to meet Nick's family for news on how their son wa doing.Botha would remain in hospital for the next few weeks for ongoing treatment to his injury. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
