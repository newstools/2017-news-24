He also appealed for patience, asking his people to "await the Supreme Court review and ruling on the election results," the earliest verdict on which is expected in May.This still sets him on a collision course with Barrow, who has repeated that he expects to take power without delay once Jammeh's mandate runs out on January 18.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
