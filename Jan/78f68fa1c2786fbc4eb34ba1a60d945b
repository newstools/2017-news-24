It calls for civil society to take the lead in creating an enabling school environment for effective teaching and learning to take place," said Mpumalanga Education MEC Reginah Mhaule.The provincial campaign made a stop at Tiphembeleni Primary School in Kanyamazane on Monday.It takes place every year before schools reopen, and focuses on mobilising communities to clean and refurbish the school environment, classrooms and the staff room. Communities got an opportunity to participate and claim ownership of their schools, and help shape the schools as centres of excellence for the community, the department said.It has partnered with residents, the local municipality, the Mpumalanga Regional Training Trust, Ehlanzeni FET College, local organised structures and the business community in implementing the campaign. Mhaule said the department also had an agreement with the department of correctional services to&nbsp;allow offenders to help with extra work. Provincial correctional services representative Khwezi Fakude said: "The department of correctional services is really not a monster that is only there to lock up offenders; but it also rehabilitates and teaches offenders skills that they can use when they are released back to the communities." Randza Xikolo Xa Wena will run throughout 2017.It will involve painting of classes and staff rooms, and also plastering and painting walled fences. Flushing toilets will also be built, grass mowed, and broken ceilings and windows will either be fixed or replaced.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
