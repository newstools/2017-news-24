EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said the break was effective immediately until February 10. "He sits for three exams on 6, 8 and 10 February, all of which he will write at 08:30 in the mornings." Malema would not be making any public appearances or taking interviews during the break, except in very special circumstances, Ndlozi said. Zuma will give his State of the Nation address on Thursday, February 9.&nbsp; Parties will respond to his address on February 14 and 15, before Zuma replies on February 16. At a press conference this week, Malema hinted at the possibility of another action-filled SONA.
