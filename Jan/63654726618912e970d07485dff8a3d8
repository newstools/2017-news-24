It is discriminatory and it is our hope that the police will review this order. It might have served a purpose at some point but not now."Zambia is a relatively stable and peaceful country, though elections last year were criticised for violence during the campaign and muzzling of the media.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
