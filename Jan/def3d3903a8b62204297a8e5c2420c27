EFF chief whip Floyd Shivambu said the party had not been invited."The committee is of the view that the objection is merely a delaying tactic aimed at frustrating the process and thereby undermining the work of the committee. The unintended effect is the extension of the time within which the NYDA functions without a board."The committee said it remained committed to finishing its work on time.It was convinced that correct procedures had been followed from the start of the process and expressed confidence that any challenge of the process would be unsuccessful.The committee also hit back at Democratic Alliance MP Yusuf Cassim, who called the process a "sham"."While the committee acknowledges and respects Mr Cassim's democratic right to free speech, the committee considers it disingenuous that he would berate the committee on social media for decisions taken by a collective."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
