I thought it was a gun. Then I realised it was a stone. My windscreen glass shattered and hit my face. Luckily I wear glasses, which saved my eyes. I tried not to panic and hit any other cars."According to Nxumalo and news reports, this was not the first time that this had occurred in the area."I have heard of this happening to others before.
