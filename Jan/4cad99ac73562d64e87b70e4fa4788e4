Absa will just wake up one day with red berets all over," said Malema.He said the party had been advised of the best time to address Absa.Malema said the most opportune time to occupy the bank would be following a repo rate announcement, when administration and adjustments were being done."Every time you have an announcement of repo rate changes, Absa must panic," he said.READ: The Absa report is a political game changerMahlobo a 'bastard'Malema said State Security Minister David Mahlobo had told people to find dirt on the Rupert family."He has been going around shopping for wrong things against the Ruperts in exchange for money," the EFF leader said.Malema said he would tell Mahlobo who the minister had gone to for information on the Ruperts should "he dare say it's nonsense"."The bastard says he doesn't know Mcebo Dlamini," he said.Malema said the EFF had exposed the state security minister, who once claimed to have had no knowledge of the University of Witwatersrand student activist."A liar of note, engaged in daily operations of state security to try and destroy the opponents, not of the state, but the Guptas," said Malema.WATCH this video:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
