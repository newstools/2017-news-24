This was followed by a litany of expletives.READ: ANCWL president &lsquo;was not @#$%&amp; drunk&rsquo;Call for spokesperson firing"Let me just tell you about the Bathabile Dlamini: I know and her attitude toward alcohol... if it were up to her, South Africa would not be drinking, there would be no alcohol advertising."She challenged reporters who wanted to publish her rant to "go the fuck ahead".No action has been taken against Oliphant. Some opposition parties have called for her to be axed, describing her comments as arrogant and reckless.Ramatlhodi said that laptops, telephones, cellphones, and even data used for official purposes, could not be used to "undermine and contravene the letter and spirit of the code of conduct without any consequences"."These misbehaving public servants abuse time which could be effectively be utilised to enhance service delivery to engage in their own private matters, which bring the public service into disrepute," the statement said.Ramatlhodi said public servants should be reminded that chapter 10 of the Constitution requires public servants to maintain and promote a high standard of professional ethics and economic and effective use of resources. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
