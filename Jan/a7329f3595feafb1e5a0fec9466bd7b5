The soldiers are seeking unpaid bonuses, higher pay, faster promotions and improved living conditions.However, the details of the deal were not made public, and it was unclear whether all soldiers would accept them.On Friday, a military official with knowledge of the negotiations said the government was resisting paying bonuses of nearly $20 000 each for an unspecified number of soldiers. The official spoke on condition of anonymity, saying he was not authorised to give his name.Ouattara and some other Ivorians have expressed frustration with the soldiers' tactics. Before the talks began on Friday, soldiers fired weapons to disperse a protest by civilians in Bouake who were angry that the standoff had disrupted economic activity in the city, said Fanta Kourouma, a Bouake resident.As Friday's talks got underway, the city center emptied out, with many residents choosing to stay at home, said journalist Aboubacar Al Syddick. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
