The decision was taken on appeal and last year the Supreme Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's findings.On Wednesday, teachers at Lukau Primary School were forced to share sheets of paper ripped out from last year's note books among pupils.School governing body chairperson Vincent Mariba echoed Sadtu's views, saying the department was failing dismally."As parents, we are disturbed that schooling is starting on the wrong footing. Now we don't know when the stationery will arrive," he said.Mariba said they were worried that urban schools were given priority over rural schools.The department said new stationery distribution companies had been brought in and this had triggered the problem."We are promising that at the end of the month every learner will be having all learning materials," Rasila said."We apologise to the pupils, educators and communities, this will never happen." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
