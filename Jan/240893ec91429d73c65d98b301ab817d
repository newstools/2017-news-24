Dogan news agency said there were two gunmen dressed in Santa Claus outfits, although this has yet to be confirmed.Television pictures showed party-goers - including men in suits and women in cocktail dresses - emerging from the nightclub in a state of shock.Sahin said the attack began at 01:15 on Sunday (22:15 GMT), just after hundreds of Turkish and foreign revellers had seen in the New Year at the club in the Ortakoy district on the European side of the city."What happened today is a terror attack," he said, without attributing blame or disclosing the fate of the attacker. Dogan reported that some witnesses claimed the assailants were "speaking Arabic" while NTV said special force police officers were still searching the club.The attack evoked memories of the November 2015 carnage in Paris when Islamic State jihadists went on a gun and bombing rampage on nightspots in the French capital, killing 130 people including 90 at the Bataclan concert hall.Security high From Sydney to Paris, Rio to London, security had been boosted over fears that the New Year festivities could present a target for violent extremists.In Istanbul, at least 17 000 police officers were deployed and some, as is customary in Turkey, dressed themselves as Santa Claus as cover, according to television reports."Just as we were settling down, by the door there was a lot of dust and smoke. Gunshots rang out. When those sounds were heard, many girls fainted," professional footballer Sefa Boydas told AFP."They say 35 to 40 died but it's probably more because when I was walking, people were walking on top of people."Dogan said there were at least 700 revellers at the club. It is one of Istanbul's most elite spots, and getting past the bouncers who seek out only the best dressed is notoriously hard.Turkey has been hit by a wave of attacks in recent months blamed on Kurdish militants and IS jihadists.On December 10, 44 people were killed in a double bombing in Istanbul after a football match hosted by top side Besiktas, an attack claimed by the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK) seen as a radical offshoot of the PKK.In June, 47 people were killed in a triple suicide bombing and gun attack at Istanbul's Ataturk airport, with authorities blaming IS.And in one of the most brazen strikes, an off-duty policeman assassinated Russia's ambassador to Turkey in an Ankara art gallery less than two weeks ago. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
