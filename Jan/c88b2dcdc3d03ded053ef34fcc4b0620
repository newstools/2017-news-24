Because people don&rsquo;t clean [properly]; rodents multiply," Mario Pluke of Rentokill told News24 on Friday.There were plenty of places for them to hide, and the gardens around malls also provided perfect shelters. The problem usually got worse over Christmas."What shops do is before December they stock up, which means areas are fully packed, creating ideal environments for rodents to hide."Eileen Slabbert of Eco-Wise pest control said malls were prone to rodent issues."Pests are definitely increasing. People don&rsquo;t want to clean and because of the dry conditions out there, rats are forced to head toward shopping centres and factories to get food," she said.READ: Rodent alert at Cape mall after rat scurries out of bread in WoolworthsSimilar experiencesNews24 reported on Thursday that a rat ran out of a customer&rsquo;s loaf of bread at a till in the Canal Walk Woolworths on January 7.A number of readers have recounted similar experiences."Saw several mice running between the groceries on the shelves.
