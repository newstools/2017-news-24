AdeM said it was giving "absolute" priority to water needed for human consumption.National news agency AIM said the water restrictions were "drastic" but suggested that residents in newer suburbs of Maputo would be less affected because many already use roof tanks to store water.Harare, the capital of neighbouring (and also water-short) Zimbabwe is in the grip of a localised typhoid outbreak that has killed two people. Typhoid can be spread by people drinking untreated water.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
