International visits by committees are, at this stage, not a priority for my office," Frolick said.Study tours by committees could only be considered after thorough motivation and discussion, he said."Our main priority is to oversee the effective implementation of government programmes that will improve the living conditions of our people," said Frolick.He said committees constituted the backbone of Parliament's work and, therefore, had to be optimally productive and work efficiently and effectively.The DA statement was misleading, he said.Steenhuisen said it was alarming that oversight visits were being cancelled for financial reasons, yet the Secretary to Parliament, Gengezi Mgidlana, continued to travel."It is difficult to understand how Parliament can rationalise the need for Mgidlana to stay at five-star hotels or be chauffeur-driven in luxury Mercedes-Benz sedans, whereas MPs are told there isn&rsquo;t money to visit the dysfunctional University of Zululand amid a higher education crisis."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
