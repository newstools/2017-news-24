Another Malian security source confirmed the report.Both suspects are Malian nationals from the country's unrest-wracked north, which fell under the control of Tuareg-led rebels and jihadist groups linked to al-Qaeda in 2012.The Islamists sidelined the rebels to take sole control.Compromising materialsAlthough they were largely ousted by a French-led military operation in January 2013, implementation of a peace accord struck in 2015 has been piecemeal with insurgents still active across large parts of the region.The suspects were arrested carrying "compromising materials", the official said, including a "GPS system, ammunition and explosive material","The first (suspect) was the logistics specialist who did the tracking," while the second was likely the would-be suicide bomber, the second security source said.He also said that both men belonged to the group of Algerian jihadist and al-Qaeda ally Mokhtar Belmokhtar, which claimed responsibility for a January 18 suicide bombing that killed more than 70 people in the northern city of Gao.The group, allied to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqim), targeted militia groups committed to restoring peace in Mali.That attack, which struck a fresh blow at efforts to stabilise the troubled north, occurred five days after French President Francois Hollande visited the military base at Gao en route to the France-Africa summit.French special forces had arrested several people ahead of the summit suspected of planning attacks during the gathering, according to Malian and foreign officials.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
