"Now whether they are here or they are not, I am in no position to tell you."Chief justice Emmanuel Fagbenle is the panel's only sitting judge, as the Supreme Court has lain dormant since May 2015. Several judges were fired after they commuted the death sentences of former military officers to life imprisonment.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
