Twenty-two others were injured.The police have blamed the driver for taking too many passengers on a truck meant to carry only goods."According to our hypothesis, the truck driver, cognisant of the offence he was committing, which was transporting too many passengers in a vehicle meant for carrying goods, drove fast to escape traffic police checks.""The driver lost control of his vehicle after having negotiated a wrong turn and ended up in the Mananara river," said Andrianatisaona.It is common practice for trucks to carry passengers on the large Indian Ocean island. They are usually capable of manoeuvring the island's bad roads.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
