This comes after a Mitchell's Plain cluster meeting was held on Wednesday 25 January where an interim chairperson was elected. Loonat served on the cluster board for 18 months. The interim chairperson Ebrahim Abrahams, previously deputy chairperson, will serve until a new chairperson is elected. The police stations in the cluster includes Grassy Park, Lansdowne, Mitchell's Plain, Steenberg, Athlone, Lentegeur, Strandfontein and Philippi. The decision was supported by seven of the eight stations. "Abrahams reconfirms the strategic objective to build stronger community oriented partnerships and expresses his commitment to find a new leader as quickly as possible," a press release said. When contacting Loonat this afternoon (26 January), he was only prepared to say the following: "The matter is sub judice. I will not comment, you were given something to bite on and I will not let it be at my expense."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
