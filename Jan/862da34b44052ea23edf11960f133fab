No democratic transfer&nbsp;One dispute was over wording for the appointment of the prime minister -- the government side want the individual to be "drawn from the opposition," whereas Gathering want the premier to be "appointed by the opposition."The opposition side also want the deal to allow a wealthy businessman and potential presidential candidate, Moise Katumbi, to be allowed to return to the country.Katumbi has been sentenced to a three-year term in prison in an alleged case of property fraud and faces another trial in an alleged case of mercenary recruitment.DRC has never witnessed a democratic transfer of power following polls since independence from Belgium in 1960.Two decades ago, the country collapsed into the deadliest conflict in modern African history.Its two wars in the late 1990s and early 2000s dragged in at least six African armies and left more than three million dead. Its restive east remains a battleground for rival ethnic militias.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
