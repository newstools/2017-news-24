Most related to defaulting on account payments. One candidate, however, had to explain her criminal record.Zandile Myeni told the committee that the criminal record was from her student activism days. She had been running for SRC president when members of a rival political party confronted her.She was merely been defending herself and was surprised to learn that charges had been laid against her.The matter went to court and she was found guilty as she did not have money to get a lawyer. She conducted her own defence, she told the committee.She said she had not declared this as she did not think it would affect her application. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
