On Friday, DRC's Roman Catholic church leaders, who mediated last month's deal, voiced concern at the "delay" in freeing political prisoners whose release had been agreed.The New Year's Eve deal called for the appointments of a new prime minister and a transitional body to pave the way to elections in December 2017 that could bring an end to the rule of President Joseph Kabila.The agreement was reached after months of violence and could set the stage for the first peaceful transfer of power in the DRC since its independence in 1960.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
