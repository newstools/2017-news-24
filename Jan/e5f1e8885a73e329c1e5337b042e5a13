"The person declared elected should take and assume office."Meanwhile, the African Union announced it will cease to recognise President Jammeh as Gambia's legitimate leader as of January 19, when his mandate expires. The decision by the AU's Peace and Security Council warns Jammeh of serious consequences if his actions lead to the "loss of innocent lives" and calls on Gambia's security forces to exercise restraint.The political uncertainty has in the past 10 days sent several thousand people, mostly children in buses accompanied by women, fleeing across border to Senegal where they are likely staying with relatives or host families, the United Nations Refugee Agency said on Friday.As the international community looks for a peaceful way out of the crisis, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari had been authorised to offer Jammeh asylum, if necessary, during Friday's visit.A definitive plan by the West African regional bloc Ecowas will be made after Buhari and Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf continue discussions with other leaders, and with Barrow in Bamako, Mali, where a France-Africa summit takes place this weekend, said Nigeria's foreign minister Geoffrey Onyeama.But the West African regional bloc also has a military force on standby to intervene if Jammeh does not step down.A Nigerian army memo, dated Wednesday and seen by The Associated Press, orders officers to prepare a battalion of 800 troops for a possible military intervention in Gambia.Jammeh at first accepted his December 1 election loss, even making a telephone call to concede on national television, but then changed his mind and declared that "only Allah" can deny him victory.His party is now contesting the results in court.President-elect Barrow is renewing his offer to Jammeh for direct discussions on the crisis, telling the BBC that "I'll be very willing to talk to him directly."The ruling party's court challenge to the election results shows complications. Gambia's Supreme Court, short of judges, has said it might not be able to consider the challenge until May, and Jammeh says Gambia should await its decision.Jammeh took power in a coup in 1994 and is accused of gross rights violations including arbitrary detentions, torture and the killings of opponents in this tiny country of 1.9 million people that is nearly surrounded by Senegal.Jammeh might be wary of a Nigerian promise of safe haven.Nigeria offered asylum to Liberian warlord Charles Taylor in 2003 to help end the civil war he started in 1989, but it was forced by international pressure to hand Taylor over in 2006 for trial for war crimes committed in Sierra Leone.Taylor was convicted in 2013 and is serving a 50-year sentence in a British prison.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
