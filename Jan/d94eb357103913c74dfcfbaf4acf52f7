We are no longer in prison. We do not have to watch our back before we express our opinions," said Fatou Cham, 28, who was celebrating with her friends.Activists will be keen to see Jammeh - who controlled certain sections of the security forces - refused amnesty for crimes committed during his tenure, which was marked by systematic rights abuses.Jim Wormington, West Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch, called Jammeh's departure "the chance to usher in an era based on respect for the rule of law and human rights."Weeping supporters&nbsp;Jammeh attempted to build a personality cult and has left behind a small minority of die hard supporters, some of whom wept as his plane departed. "We wanted to be behind this man for a century or more," said Alagie Samu, speaking on the tarmac. "He is the most successful, visionary leader in the entire world."Dressed in green, the colour of his political party, some were loyal to the end."No human being is perfect, but for 22 years in the country here he has tried hard for Gambians," said a woman with cheeks wet from tears, who did not wish to be named.The Gambia is one of the world's poorest nations and although education and health standards have lifted in recent years, poverty remains endemic.With Jammeh gone, all eyes will be on the Barrow administration as they make their first steps as a government of reform and development."The will of the people has come to be at last," said Isatou Touray, a key official in the government-in-waiting. "Democracy is back, you can't stop the people."Army chief Ousman Badjie, a former Jammeh loyalist, has pledged allegiance to Barrow along with top defence, civil service and security chiefs.The first priority will be to help the tens of thousands who have fled in recent weeks fearing a bloody end to the crisis to return safely, Touray said earlier on Saturday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
