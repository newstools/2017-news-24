But last week, the US Court of Appeals in Chicago tossed out his lawsuit, opening the door for extradition proceedings to continue in Nigeria.Nigeria's National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) is now working on overcoming its own domestic legal hurdles to arrest and extradite Kashamu. "He has a court order restraining the NDLEA from arresting him, we have also instituted a suit to vacate that order, and the process is ongoing," NDLEA spokesperson Mitchell Ofoyeju told AFP. "We'll definitely proceed with the extradition proceedings, and once the court has ruled that he can be extradited then we have no choice to enforce the court ruling."Kashamu was reported as telling Nigeria's Punch newspaper that "there is no extradition that can be brought against me again" and that he would not allow himself to be seized."Orange is the New Black" is a hit series based on a best-selling autobiography by Piper Kerman chronicling her time in prison for money laundering after working for a "West African drug lord".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
