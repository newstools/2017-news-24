Nigeria recently said it has forced the jihadists out of their Sambisa forest stronghold, but residents in the area believe the ISIS-affiliated group is still present.The raid was the latest in a string of assaults or attempted attacks in Borno state by suicide bombers, often young women.At last 20 000 people have been killed since the start of the Boko Haram insurgency in 2009. Violence continues, despite government and military claims the group is on the verge of defeat.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
