It also said some Christian groups "discriminated against non-Christian religious groups, especially in rural areas where people generally held negative views on Islam."The new education policy comes after public complaints over Asian and Muslim migration into the country led parliament to set up a commission of enquiry last year.Some illegal migrants have since been deported, and Minister of Commerce and Trade Jabulani Mabuza told parliament that a law making it harder for foreigners to set up businesses in Swaziland was in the pipeline. Church leaders in Swaziland welcomed the Christianity-only syllabus."Christianity is the bedrock religion on which this country was built," said Stephen Masilela, president of the Swaziland Conference of Churches.Swaziland, with a population of about 1.2 million, has been ruled by King Mswati III, Africa's last absolute monarch, since 1986.The country suffers dire poverty and has struggled to lift its economy, and has faced international criticism that the government stifles dissent, jails its opponents and denies workers' rights.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
