He did not make any public statements during the mutiny,however, and he has consistently backed Ivory Coast's constitutional reform.The two-day revolt was worst in the country's second city of Bouake, the cradle of a failed attempt in 2002 to oust then president Laurent Gbagbo.That revolt sliced the former French colony into the rebel-held north and the government-controlled south and triggered months of deadly unrest.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
