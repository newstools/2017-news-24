'Toothful on paper, but toothless in reality'Gungubele expressed his fear that the Hawks investigation may take too long, which could lead to a perception in society that Icasa was "toothful on paper, but toothless in reality".The ANC in Parliament, in a statement on Tuesday, welcomed Icasa's progress report, but again encouraged it to be more proactive."As the regulator for the South African communications, broadcasting and postal services sector, Icasa must hold its licensees accountable to its laws and regulations."We await the outcomes of the criminal investigation and have no doubt that it will be in the interest of the people of South Africa."Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi, meanwhile, told News24 that he did not yet have the full details of the investigation into the SABC.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
