Diplomats in the region have voiced private concern that Barrow's safety is not being guaranteed by the state, as he relies on unarmed volunteers to act as bodyguards.The UN recently stopped Badjie from visiting troops serving as peacekeepers in Darfur, Sudan due to "serious concerns... given the situation in Banjul".The controversial army chief's declaration came as the head of Gambia's electoral commission fled to neighbouring Senegal fearing for his safety.Alieu Momar Njie suspected a plot against him after his commission's headquarters were locked down by the security forces for several days while Jammeh challenges the election result in the Supreme Court.A crackdown in recent days by security agents has also shut two radio stations, while a group of traders selling t-shirts featuring Barrow's image were briefly detained.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
