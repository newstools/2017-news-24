These are the types of words to use if you want scores of people to attend any event, because the guests will surely come. This was the case last Saturday at Gerotek Test Facilities in Pretoria, when Tsogo Sun invited celebrities and the media to the launch of its latest promotion, Dream Chaser.I always find it interesting how the guests who attend these events most probably cannot afford the products which the various companies promote.This is where I put my foot in it and mention that Thando Thabethe, host of 5FM&rsquo;s The Thando Thabooty Show, as well as TV presenter Andile Gaelesiwe were present. Even if attendees Donovan, Jason and Nicholas Goliath had to pool together all their money, they would still struggle to buy the Maserati Ghibli&rsquo;s rear-view mirror. Perhaps the only guests in attendance who could afford the car were the Booths, the power couple consisting of model, author and businesswoman Sonia and soccer legend husband Matthew. As with these type of bourgeois gatherings, everyone tried to downplay their excitement at being at the wheel of such a monster as the Ghibli. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, the Maserati Ghibli is nothing like the small hatches most of us drive. The only way these journalists and persons of interest will afford such a luxurious car is if they try their luck at Gold Reef City, Montecasino and Silverstar casinos, as there is also R9 million up for grabs as part of the Tsogo Sun Dream Chaser promotion. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
