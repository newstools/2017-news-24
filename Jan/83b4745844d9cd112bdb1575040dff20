In the meantime, the city is making use of contractors and employees from other regions to ensure that service delivery is uninterrupted."However, Makhubela condemned the alleged slurs."Such remarks are reminiscent of the apartheid and national party attitude towards the indigenous people of this country.""He [du Toit] has also degraded black people as people not deserving of the jobs they are currently occupying because of ANC policies and their skills and qualifications as he claims that black people are inherently inadequate, unequal to the task and must only work as messengers and gardeners," he said.'The people run this municipality'On Thursday, in support of the workers, the EFF members visited du Toit's Centurion office.EFF councillor Kintiki Mazwi said party members had gone to the offices of the Department of Energy to discuss the allegations with du Toit."We told him we were not criminals but councillors.
