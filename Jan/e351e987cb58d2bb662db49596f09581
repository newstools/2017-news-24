"It was a friendly, brotherly request."The Turkish leader, who traveled to Mozambique from Tanzania, also asked Mozambican officials to open an embassy in Turkey and to allow a Turkish aid agency, TIKA, to operate in the southern African country.Erdogan, who met Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi, also plans to visit Madagascar before returning to Turkey on Wednesday.Hasan Ucar, secretary-general of Ravinala, an institute in Madagascar that is inspired by Gulen, said he expects Erdogan to "negotiate" with the government to close Gulen-linked operations that Ucar described as having "good reputations for years."Turkey opened an embassy in Madagascar in 2010, though Gulen's supporters had been operating in the country since 2002 and previously acted as informal envoys for Turkey, Ucar wrote in an email to The Associated Press.He criticized Turkey's massive purge of alleged Gulen supporters and said people in Madagascar are awaiting the reaction to Erdogan's overtures from their president, Hery Rajaonarimampianina. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
