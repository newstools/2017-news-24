"Expanding drought conditions have left hundreds of thousands of Somalis facing severe food and water shortages. Overall, some five million people are in need of humanitarian assistance," said de Clercq.The humanitarian community in Somalia is seeking $864m for its operations in 2017, to "avert catastrophe" from the drought.Famine early warning system Fewsnet warned on Monday that if 2017 rains were again poor in Somalia - as forecast - "famine would be expected."However concerns are even higher for conflict-torn South Sudan, where fighting has compounded the fallout from the drought, and few humanitarian organisations remain. In Kenya, the drought has led to a rise in conflict between pastoral communities looking to graze their animals, while roaming wildlife are coming into conflict with humans as they seek new water sources.Nairobi, East Africa's economic hub, is under strict water rationing for four months, when the next rainy season is expected to start.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
