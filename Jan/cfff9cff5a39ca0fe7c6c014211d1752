It is an important rally for the ANC amidst&nbsp; all the negativity. We will weather the storm," Mbalula said."We are confident that our members will defy the prophets of doom countering our rally including [those on] social media."The party has been hit by a social media backlash ahead of the event. Its Twitter campaign #IamANC saw users air their grievances against the party or use the opportunity to poke fun at it.On Thursday the hashtag #DontFillupOrlando trended, with users urging people not to attend the party&rsquo;s Sunday rally.#DontfillupOrlando appeared to have gained traction following Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema&rsquo;s tweet, "If you are young and find yourself at Orlando Stadium on Sunday, then you are a traitor,&nbsp; the unemployed and the poor in Soweto must stay at home".The ANC has urged those attending to bring raincoats and said it would improvise where it could at the stadium by providing a plastic shelter.The party plans to fill the 40 000 capacity stadium and an overflow area has been arranged.&nbsp; As many as 800 buses, including from neighbouring provinces, have been organised to ferry those attending. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
