He made the comments at a &ldquo;Hands off Zuma&rdquo; march in eThekwini, KwaZulu-Natal.The NEC member said she continued to see Maine as a fellow comrade who needed to be told when he was in the wrong. She could no longer be part of processes she did not understand, but was expected to support.Mlondi would not comment and said it was up to the ANCYL to respond. Siweya could not be reached for comment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
