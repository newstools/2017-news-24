With a small rope still attached, the whale swam off confidently, he said.The team found a second whale, south-west of the island, trapped to the ocean floor by a line of rope running to an anchored lobster trap.The eight-metre Humpback had rope through its mouth running to its tail. The team cut the rope free and escorted it through the lobster trap lines out into open water, where it swam off.A third entangled whale was reported but could not be found, said Meyer. Having found a loose flotation buoy, the team suspected the whale may have freed itself. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
